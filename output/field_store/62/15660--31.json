Or is this but a storm of the noon-tide that the wind is driving past?       \"Unscathed as yet it standeth; it bears the stormy drift,     Nor bows to the lightening flashing adown from the cloudy lift.     I see the hail of battle and the onslaught of the strong,     And they go adown to the folk-mote that shall bide there over long.     I see the slain-heaps rising and the alien folk prevail,     And the Goths give back before them on the ridge o'er the treeless     vale.     I see the ancient fallen, and the young man smitten dead,     And yet I see the War-duke shake Throng-plough o'er his head,     And stand unhelmed, unbyrnied before the alien host,     And the hurt men rise around him to win back battle lost;     And the wood yield up her warriors, and the whole host rushing on,     And the swaying lines of battle until the lost is won.     Then forth goes the cry of triumph, as they ring the captives round     And cheat the crow of her portion and heap the warriors' mound.     There are faces gone from our feast-hall not the least beloved nor     worst,     But the wane of the House of the Wolfings not yet the world hath     cursed.     The sun shall rise to-morrow on our cold and dewy roof,     For they that longed for slaughter were slaughtered far aloof.\"    She ceased for a little, but her countenance, which had not changed  during her song, changed not at all now: so they all kept silence  although they were rejoicing in this new tale of victory; for they deemed  that she was not yet at the end of her speaking.  And in good sooth she  spake again presently, and said:       \"I wot not what hath befallen nor where my soul may be,     For confusion is within me and but dimly do I see,     As if the thing that I look on had happed a while ago.     They stand by the tofts of a war-garth, a captain of the foe,     And a man that is of the Goth-folk, and as friend and friend they     speak,     But I hear no word they are saying, though for every word I seek.     And now the mist flows round me and blind I come aback     To the House-roof of the Wolfings and the hearth that hath no lack.\"    Her voice grew weaker as she spake the last words, and she sank backward  on to her chair: her clenched hands opened, the lids fell down over her  bright eyes, her breast heaved no more as it had done, and presently she  fell asleep.    The folk were doubtful and somewhat heavy-hearted because of those last  words of hers; but they would not ask her more, or rouse her from her  sleep, lest they should grieve her; so they departed to their beds and  slept for what was yet left of the night.          CHAPTER XIV--THE HALL-SUN IS CAREFUL CONCERNING THE PASSES OF THE WOOD      In the morning early folk arose; and the lads and women who were not of  the night-shift got them ready to go to the mead and the acres; for the  sunshine had been plenty these last days and the wheat was done  blossoming, and all must be got ready for harvest.  So they broke their  fast, and got their tools into their hands: but they were somewhat heavy-  hearted because of those last words of the Hall-Sun, and the doubt of  last night still hung about them, and they were scarcely as merry as men  are wont to be in the morning.    As for the Hall-Sun, she was afoot with the earliest, and was no less,  but mayhap more merry than her wont was, and was blithe with all, both  old and young.    But as they were at the point of going she called to them, and said:    \"Tarry a little, come ye all to the dais and hearken to me.\"    So they all gathered thereto, and she stood in her place and spake.    \"Women and elders of the Wolfings, is it so that I spake somewhat of  tidings last night?\"    \"Yea,\" said they all.    She said, \"And was it a word of victory?\"    They answered \"yea\" again.    \"Good is that,\" she said; \"doubt ye not! there is nought to unsay.  But  hearken!  I am nothing wise in war like Thiodolf or Otter of the Laxings,  or as Heriulf the Ancient was, though he was nought so wise as they be.  Nevertheless ye shall do well to take me for your captain, while this  House is bare of warriors.\"    \"Yea, yea,\" they said, \"so will we.\"    And an old warrior, hight Sorli, who sat in his chair, no longer quite  way-worthy, said:    \"Hall-Sun, this we looked for of thee; since thy wisdom is not wholly the  wisdom of a spae-wife, but rather is of the children of warriors: and we  know thine heart to be high and proud, and that thy death seemeth to thee  a small matter beside the life of the Wolfing House.\"    Then she smiled and said, \"Will ye all do my bidding?\"    And they all cried out heartily, \"Yea, Hall-Sun, that will we.\"    She said: \"Hearken then; ye all know that east of Mirkwood-water, when ye  come to the tofts of the Bearings, and their Great Roof, the thicket  behind them is close, but that there is a wide way cut through it; and  often have I gone there: if ye go by that way, in a while ye come to the  thicket's end and to bare places where the rocks crop up through the  gravel and the woodland loam.  There breed the coneys without number; and  wild-cats haunt the place for that sake, and foxes; and the wood-wolf  walketh there in summer-tide, and hard by the she-wolf hath her litter of  whelps, and all these have enough; and the bald-head erne hangeth over it  and the kite, and also the kestril, for shrews and mice abound there.  Of  these things there is none that feareth me, and none that maketh me  afraid.  Beyond this place for a long way the wood is nowise thick, for  first grow ash-trees about the clefts of the rock and also quicken-trees,  but not many of either; and here and there a hazel brake easy to thrust  through; then comes a space of oak-trees scattered about the lovely wood-  lawn, and then at last the beech-wood close above but clear beneath.  This  I know well, because I myself have gone so far and further; and by this  easy way have I gone so far to the south, that I have come out into the  fell country, and seen afar off the snowy mountains beyond the Great  Water.    \"Now fear ye not, but pluck up a heart!  For either I have seen it or  dreamed it, or thought it, that by this road easy to wend the Romans  should come into the Mark.  For shall not those dastards and traitors  that wear the raiment and bodies of the Goths over the hearts and the  lives of foemen, tell them hereof?  And will they not have heard of our  Thiodolf, and this my holy namesake?    \"Will they not therefore be saying to themselves, 'Go to now, why should  we wrench the hinges off the door with plenteous labour, when another  door to the same chamber standeth open before us?  This House of the  Wolfings is the door to the treasure chamber of the Markmen; let us fall  on that at once rather than have many battles for other lesser matters,  and then at last have to fight for this also: for having this we have  all, and they shall be our thralls, and we may slaughter what we will,  and torment what we will and deflower what we will, and make our souls  glad with their grief and anguish, and take aback with us to the cities  what we will of the thralls, that their anguish and our joy may endure  the longer.'  Thus will they say: therefore is it my rede that the  strongest and hardiest of you women take horse, a ten of you and one to  lead besides, and ride the shallows to the Bearing House, and tell them  of our rede; which is to watch diligently the ways of the wood; the  outgate to the Mark, and the places where the wood is thin and easy to  travel on: and ye shall bid them give you of their folk as many as they  deem fittest thereto to join your company, so that ye may have a chain of  watchers stretching far into the wilds; but two shall lie without the  wood, their horses ready for them to leap on and ride on the spur to the  wain-burg in the Upper-mark if any tidings befal.    \"Now of these eleven I ordain Hrosshild to be the leader and captain, and  to choose for her fellows the stoutest-limbed and heaviest-handed of all  the maidens here: art thou content Hrosshild?\"    Then stood Hrosshild forth and said nought, but nodded yea; and soon was  her choice made amid jests and laughter, for this seemed no hard matter  to them.    So the ten got together, and the others fell off from them, and there  stood the ten maidens with Hrosshild, well nigh as strong as men, clean-  limbed and tall, tanned with sun and wind; for all these were unwearied  afield, and oft would lie out a-nights, since they loved the lark's song  better than the mouse's squeak; but as their kirtles shifted at neck and  wrist, you might see their skins as white as privet-flower where they  were wont to be covered.    Then said the Hall-Sun: \"Ye have heard the word, see ye to it, Hrosshild,  and take this other word also: Bid the Bearing stay-at-homes bide not the  sword and the torch at home if the Romans come, but hie them over hither,  to hold the Hall or live in the wild-wood with us, as need may be; for  might bides with many.    \"But ye maidens, take this counsel for yourselves; do ye each bear with  you a little keen knife, and if ye be taken, and it seem to you that ye  may not bear the smart of the Roman torments (for they be wise in  tormenting), but will speak and bewray us under them, then thrust this  little edge tool into the place of your bodies where the life lieth  closest, and so go to the Gods with a good tale in your mouths: so may  the Almighty God of Earth speed you, and the fathers of the kindred!\"    So she spoke; and they made no delay but each one took what axe or spear  or sword she liked best, and two had their bows and quivers of arrows;  and so all folk went forth from the Hall.    Soon were the horses saddled and bridled, and the maidens bestrode them  joyously and set forth on their way, going down the lanes of the wheat,  and rode down speedily toward"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2888"],[0,"Yorkshire Dialect Poems (1673-1915) and traditional poems (#20)"],[1,"i' bed whal Setterday nean.       1.
