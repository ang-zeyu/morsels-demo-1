Kimball, an Apostle (#20)"],[1,"beyond measure, by men in and out of the Church, as though he were the  sole and intentional cause of the catastrophe.    \"This order of things,\" continues Heber, \"increased during the winter  to such an extent that a man's life was in danger the moment he spoke  in defence of the Prophet of God. During this time I had many days of  sorrow and mourning, for my heart sickened to see the awful extent  that things were getting to. The only source of consolation I had, was  in bending my knees continually before my Father in Heaven, and asking  Him to sustain me and preserve me from falling into snares, and from  betraying my brethren as others had done; for those who apostatized  sought every means and opportunity to draw others after them. They  also entered into combinations to obtain wealth by fraud and every  means that was evil.    \"At this time, I had many dreams from the Lord; one of them I will  relate. I dreamed that I entered the house of John F. Boynton, in  which there was a panther; he was jet black and very beautiful to look  upon, but he inspired me with fear; when I rose to leave the house he  stood at the door with the intention to seize on me, and seeing my  fear, he displayed his beauty to me, telling me how sleek his coat  was, and what beautiful ears he had, and also his claws, which  appeared to be of silver, and then he showed me his teeth, which also  appeared to be silver. John F. Boynton told me that if I made myself  familiar with him he would not hurt me, but if I did not he would. I  did not feel disposed to do so, and while the panther was displaying  to me his beauty, I slipped through the door and escaped, although he  tried to keep me back by laying hold of my coat; but I rent myself  from him. The interpretation of this dream was literally fulfilled.  The panther represented an apostate whom I had been very familiar  with. I felt to thank the Lord for this dream, and other intimations  that I had, which, by His assistance, kept me from falling into  snares.\"    The hour was approaching when Heber C. Kimball was destined to make  his great mark as an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ, to perform a  work that would perpetuate his memory, and make his name \"a household  word\" upon the lips of tens of thousands in both hemispheres.          CHAPTER XIV.    ZION'S SHIP AMONG THE BREAKERS--\"SOMETHING NEW MUST BE DONE TO SAVE  THE CHURCH\"--HEBER C. KIMBALL APPOINTED TO OPEN THE BRITISH  MISSION--SPIRITUAL THINGS TO THE FRONT--RIGHTING THE SHIP--HEBER'S  PROPHECY TO WILLARD RICHARDS--\"YEA, IN THE NAME OF THE LORD, THOU  SHALT GO WITH ME\"--THE DEPARTURE FOR ENGLAND.      At this crisis in the affairs of the Church, the Lord revealed to  Joseph that \"something new\" must be done for its salvation. The good  ship Zion, storm-tossed and tempest-driven, her sails rent, her  timbers sprung, a portion of her officers and crew in open mutiny, was  drifting with fearful rapidity toward the rocks and breakers of  destruction.    Joseph was denounced as a \"fallen prophet\" by men who had been his  immediate friends and confidential advisers, and the divinity of his  mission was being doubted by many who had received through him a  testimony of the truth, the gift of the Holy Ghost, a knowledge of God  and Christ, whom to know is life eternal.    \"No quorum in the Church,\" says he, \"was entirely exempt from the  influence of those false spirits who were striving against me for the  mastery. Even some of the Twelve were so far lost to their high and  responsible calling, as to begin to take sides, secretly, with the  enemy.\"    What \"new thing,\" under these circumstances, was destined to \"save the  Church?\" In what way was Joseph's mission, as a prophet of the living  God, to be revindicated in the eyes of the Saints and of the world?    \"On Sunday, the 4th day of June, 1837,\" says Heber C. Kimball, \"the  Prophet Joseph came to me, while I was seated in front of the stand,  above the sacrament table, on the Melchisedek side of the Temple, in  Kirtland, and whispering to me, said, 'Brother Heber, the Spirit of  the Lord has whispered to me: 'Let my servant Heber go to England and  proclaim my Gospel, and open the door of salvation to that nation.'\"    The thought was overpowering. He had been surprised at his call to the  apostleship: now he was overwhelmed. Like Jeremiah he staggered under  the weight of his own weakness, exclaiming in self-humiliation: \"O,  Lord, I am a man of stammering tongue, and altogether unfit for such a  work; how can I go to preach in that land, which is so famed  throughout Christendom for learning, knowledge and piety; the nursery  of religion; and to a people whose intelligence is proverbial!\"    \"Feeling my weakness to go upon such an errand, I asked the Prophet if  Brother Brigham might go with me. He replied that he wanted Brother  Brigham to stay with him, for he had something else for him to do. The  idea of such a mission was almost more than I could bear up under. I  was almost ready to sink under the burden which was placed upon me.    \"However, all these considerations did not deter me from the path of  duty; the moment I understood the will of my heavenly Father, I felt a  determination to go at all hazards, believing that He would support me  by His almighty power, and endow me with every qualification that I  needed; and although my family was dear to me, and I should have to  leave them almost destitute, I felt that the cause of truth, the  Gospel of Christ, outweighed every other consideration.    \"At this time many faltered in their faith; even some of the Twelve  were in rebellion against the Prophet of God. John F. Boynton said to  me, 'If you are such a fool as to go at the call of the fallen  prophet, Joseph Smith, I will not help you a dime, and if you are cast  on Van Dieman's land, I will not make an effort to help you.' Lyman E.  Johnson said he did not want me to go on my mission, but if I was  determined to go, he would help me all he could; he took his cloak  from off his back and put it on mine; which was the first cloak I ever  had.    \"Brothers Sidney Rigdon, Joseph Smith, Sen., Brigham Young, Newel K.  Whitney and others said, 'Go and do as the Prophet has told you, and  you shall prosper and be blessed with power to do a glorious work.'  Hyrum, seeing the condition of the Church, when he talked about my  mission, wept like a little child; he was continually blessing and  encouraging me, and pouring out his soul in prophecies upon my head;  he said: 'Go, and you shall prosper as not many have prospered.'\"    Elder Orson Hyde, who had had some disagreement with the authorities  and was thought to be disaffected, gave a noble proof of his integrity  by asking forgiveness of the brethren, and requesting the privilege of  accompanying Apostle Kimball on his mission to England. He was  accordingly set apart, with Elder Kimball and Priest Joseph Fielding,  for that purpose.    Says Heber: \"The Presidency laid their hands on me and set me apart to  preside over the mission, and conferred great blessings upon my head;  said that God would make me mighty in that nation in winning souls  unto Him; angels should accompany me and bear me up, that my feet  should never slip; that I should be mightily blessed and prove a  source of salvation to thousands, not only in England but America.    \"After being called on this mission, I daily went into the east room  in the attic story of the temple and poured out my soul unto the Lord,  asking His protection and power to fulfill honorably the mission  appointed me by His servants. A short time previous to starting, I was  laid prostrate on my bed with a stitch in my back, which suddenly  seized me while chopping and drawing wood for my family. I could not  stir a limb without crying out from the severeness of the pain.  Joseph, hearing of it, came to see me, bringing Oliver Cowdery and  Bishop Partridge with him; they prayed for and blessed me, Joseph  being mouth, beseeching God to raise me up; he then took me by the  right hand and said, 'Brother Heber, I take you by your right hand in  the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, and by virtue of the Holy  Priesthood vested in me I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to  arise, and be thou made whole.' I arose from my bed, put on my  clothes, and started with them and went up to the temple, and felt no  more of the pain afterwards.\"    Though amazed and overwhelmed at his call to this duty, the voice of  the Spirit in his own heart had long since told him that he would some  day be required to perform just such a work. As with all men of  destiny, the mountain of his mission loomed before him dimly in the  distance, casting its shadow athwart his soul, and there were times  when, worn and wearied with life's common cares, he sought within that  shade shelter and repose from the noontide's heat and toil. Thus doth  the ideal subserve the real, of which, what is it but the prophecy?    Some months prior to his appointment, in a conversation with Willard  Richards in the streets of Kirtland, soon after the latter was  baptized, Heber, filled with the spirit of prophecy, had predicted for  himself a mission to the shores of Europe.    \"Shall I go with thee?\" enquired Willard.    \"Yea, in the name of the Lord, thou shalt go with me when I go,\" Heber  replied.    But Willard was now in the eastern states, on a special business  mission, and the day of Heber's departure was drawing near. Just one  day before he left for England, Elder Richards returned, and was  reminded by the Apostle of the prediction he had uttered five months  before. Willard, being involved in business, and not having received a  formal call, did not see how he could go. But, on consulting with the  First Presidency, and obtaining their consent, and his partner in  business, Brigham Young, agreeing to take charge of their affairs in  his absence, he was enabled to fulfill his covenant with Heber, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3534"],[0,"A Complete Account of the Settlement at Port Jackson (#20)"],[1,"nd, which even among us would  baffle cure without amputation of the arm at the shoulder, was deemed so  fatal, that they despaired of success, and therefore left it to itself. Had  Mr. White found the man alive, there is little room to think that he  could have been of any use to him; for that an Indian would submit to so  formidable and alarming an operation seems hardly probable.    None of the natives who had come in the boat would touch the body, or even  go near it, saying, the mawn would come; that is literally, 'the spirit of  the deceased would seize them'. Of the people who died among us, they had  expressed no such apprehension. But how far the difference of a natural  death, and one effected by violence, may operate on their fears to induce  superstition; and why those who had performed the rites of sepulture should  not experience similar fears and reluctance, I leave to be determined.  Certain it is (as I shall insist upon more hereafter), that they believe  the spirit of the dead not to be extinct with the body.    Baneelon took an odd method of revenging the death of his countryman. At  the head of several of his tribe, he robbed one of the private boats of  fish, threatening the people, who were unarmed, that in case they resisted  he would spear them. On being taxed by the governor with this outrage, he  at first stoutly denied it; but on being confronted with the people who  were in the boat, he changed his language, and, without deigning even to  palliate his offence, burst into fury and demanded who had killed Bangai.          CHAPTER XIII.        The Transactions of the Colony continued to the End of May, 1791.      December, 1790. The Dutch snow from Batavia arrived on the 17th of the  month, after a passage of twelve weeks, in which she had lost sixteen of  her people. But death, to a man who has resided at Batavia, is too familiar  an object to excite either terror or regret. All the people of the 'Supply'  who were left there sick, except one midshipman, had also perished in that  fatal climate.    The cargo of the snow consisted chiefly of rice, with a small quantity of  beef, pork, and flour.    A letter was received by this vessel, written by the Shebander at Batavia,  to governor Phillip, acquainting him that war had commenced between England  and Spain. As this letter was written in the Dutch language we did not find  it easy of translation. It filled us, however, with anxious perturbation,  and with wishes as impotent, as they were eager, in the cause of our  country. Though far beyond the din of arms, we longed to contribute to her  glory, and to share in her triumphs.    Placed out of the reach of attack, both by remoteness and insignificancy,  our only dread lay lest those supplies intended for our consumption should  be captured. Not, however, to be found totally unprovided in case an enemy  should appear, a battery was planned near the entrance of Sydney Cove, and  other formidable preparations set on foot.    The commencement of the year 1791, though marked by no circumstances  particularly favourable, beamed far less inauspicious than that of 1790 had  done.    January, 1791. No circumstance, however apparently trivial, which can  tend to throw light on a new country, either in respect of its present  situation, or its future promise, should pass unregarded. On the 24th of  January, two bunches of grapes were cut in the governor's garden, from  cuttings of vines brought three years before from the Cape of Good Hope.  The bunches were handsome, the fruit of a moderate size, but well filled  out and the flavour high and delicious.    The first step after unloading the Dutch snow was to dispatch the 'Supply'  to Norfolk Island for captain Hunter, and the crew of the 'Sirius' who had  remained there ever since the loss of that ship. It had always been the  governor's wish to hire the Dutchman, for the purpose of transporting them  to England. But the frantic extravagant behaviour of the master of her, for  a long time frustrated the conclusion of a contract. He was so totally  lost to a sense of reason and propriety, as to ask eleven pounds per ton,  monthly, for her use, until she should arrive from England, at Batavia.  This was treated with proper contempt; and he was at last induced to accept  twenty shillings a ton, per month (rating her at three hundred tons) until  she should arrive in England--being about the twenty-fifth part of his  original demand. And even at this price she was, perhaps, the dearest  vessel ever hired on a similar service, being totally destitute of every  accommodation and every good quality which could promise to render so long  a voyage either comfortable or expeditious.    February, 1791. On the 26th, Captain Hunter, his officers and ship's  company joined us; and on the 28th of March the snow sailed with them for  England, intending to make a northern passage by Timor and Batavia, the  season being too far advanced to render the southern route by Cape Horn  practicable*.    [*They did not arrive in England until April, 1792.]    Six days previous to the departure of captain Hunter, the indefatigable  'Supply' again sailed for Norfolk Island, carrying thither captain Hill  and a detachment of the New South Wales corps. A little native boy named  Bondel, who had long particularly attached himself to captain Hill,  accompanied him, at his own earnest request. His father had been killed in  battle and his mother bitten in two by a shark: so that he was an orphan,  dependant on the humanity of his tribe for protection*. His disappearance  seemed to make no impression on the rest of his countrymen, who were  apprized of his resolution to go. On the return of the 'Supply' they  inquired eagerly for him, and on being told that the place he was gone  to afforded plenty of birds and other good fare, innumerable volunteers  presented themselves to follow him, so great was their confidence in us and  so little hold of them had the amor patriae.    [*I am of opinion that such protection is always extended to children who  may be left destitute.]      March, 1791. The snow had but just sailed, when a very daring manoeuvre was  carried into execution, with complete success, by a set of convicts, eleven  in number, including a woman, wife of one of the party, and two little  children. They seized the governor's cutter and putting into her a  seine, fishing-lines, and hooks, firearms, a quadrant, compass, and some  provisions, boldly pushed out to sea, determined to brave every danger and  combat every hardship, rather than remain longer in a captive state. Most  of these people had been brought out in the first fleet, and the terms of  transportation of some of them were expired. Among them were a fisherman,  a carpenter, and some competent navigators, so that little doubt was  entertained that a scheme so admirably planned would be adequately  executed*. When their elopement was discovered, a pursuit was ordered  by the governor. But the fugitives had made too good an use of the  intermediate time to be even seen by their pursuers. After the escape of  Captain Bligh, which was well known to us, no length of passage or hazard  of navigation seemed above human accomplishment. However to prevent future  attempts of a like nature, the governor directed that boats only of stated  dimensions should be built. Indeed an order of this sort had been issued  on the escape of the first party, and it was now repeated with additional  restrictions.    [*It was my fate to fall in again with part of this little band of  adventurers. In March 1792, when I arrived in the Gorgon, at the Cape of  Good Hope, six of these people, including the woman and one child, were put  on board of us to be carried to England. Four had died, and one had jumped  overboard at Batavia. The particulars of their voyage were briefly as  follows. They coasted the shore of New Holland, putting occasionally into  different harbours which they found in going along. One of these harbours,  in the latitude of 30 degrees south, they described to be of superior  excellence and capacity. Here they hauled their bark ashore, paid her seams  with tallow, and repaired her. But it was with difficulty they could keep  off the attacks of the Indians. These people continued to harras them so  much that they quitted the mainland and retreated to a small island in  the harbour, where they completed their design. Between the latitude of 26  degrees and 27 degrees, they were driven by a current 30 leagues from the  shore, among some islands, where they found plenty of large turtles. Soon  after they closed again with the continent, when the boat got entangled in  the surf and was driven on shore, and they had all well nigh perished. They  passed rough the straits of Endeavour and, beyond the gulf of Carpentaria,  found a large freshwater river, which they entered, and filled from it  their empty casks.    Until they reached the gulf of Carpentaria, they saw no natives or canoes  differing from those about Port Jackson. But now they were chased by large  canoes, jitted with sails and fighting stages, and capable of holding  thirty men each. They escaped by dint of rowing to windward. On the 5th  of June 1791 they reached Timor, and pretended that they had belonged to a  ship which, on her passage from Port Jackson to India, had foundered;  and that they only had escaped. The Dutch received them with kindness  and treated them with hospitality. But their behaviour giving rise to  suspicion, they were watched; and one of them at last, in a moment of  intoxication, betrayed the secret. They were immediately secured and  committed to prison. Soon after Captain Edwards of the Pandora, who had  been wrecked near Endeavour straits, arrived at Timor, and they were  delivered up to him, by which means they became passengers in the Gorgon.    I confess that I never looked at these people without pity and  astonishment."]]]
