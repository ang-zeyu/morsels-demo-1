That was when we was little girls goin' together to fetch the mail. It  was hot an' dusty an' we stopped to cool off an' wade in the 'branch'.  We heard a horse trottin' an' looked up an' there was Marster switchin'  his ridin' whip an' lookin' at us. 'Git for home, you two, and I'll  'tend to you,' he says, an' we got! But this time I let Miss Ella go to  'the house' alone an' I sneaked aroun' to Granny's cabin an' hid. I was  afraid I'd git whupped! 'Nother time, Miss Ella went to town an' told me  to keep up her fire whilst she was away. I fell asleep on the hearth and  the fire done burnt out so's when Miss Ella come home the room was cold.  She was mad as hops. Said she never had hit me but she sure felt like  doin' it then.    \"Yes'm, I been here a right smart while. I done lived to see three  generations of my white folks come an' go, an' they're the finest folks  on earth. There use to be a reg'lar buryin' ground for the plantation  hands. The colored chillen use to play there but I always played with  the white chillen. (This accounts for Aunt Betty's gentle manner and  speech.) Three of the old log cabins (slave cabins) is there yet. One of  'em was the 'boys cabin'. (house for boys and unmarried men) They've got  walls a foot thick an' are used for store-rooms now. After freedom we  buried out around our little churches but some of th' old grounds are  plowed under an' turned into pasture cause the colored folks didn't get  no deeds to 'em. It won't be long 'fore I go too but I'm gwine lie near  my old home an' my folks.    \"Yes'm, I remember Marse Israel Lash, my Pappy's Marster. He was a low,  thick-set man, very jolly an' friendly. He was real smart an' good too,  'cause his colored folks all loved 'im. He worked in the bank an' when  the Yankees come, 'stead of shuttin' the door 'gainst 'em like the  others did, he bid 'em welcome. (Betty's nodding head, expansive smile  and wide-spread hands eloquently pantomime the banker's greeting.) So  the Yankees done took the bank but give it back to 'im for his very own  an' he kep' it but there was lots of bad feelin' 'cause he never give  folks the money they put in the old bank. (Possibly this explains the  closing of the branch of the Cape Fear Bank in Salem and opening of  Israel Lash's own institution, the First National Bank of Salem, 1866.)    \"I saw General Robert E. Lee, too. After the war he come with some  friends to a meeting at Five Forks Baptist Church. All the white folks  gathered 'round an' shook his hand an' I peeked 'tween their legs an'  got a good look at' im. But he didn't have no whiskers, he was  smooth-face! (Pictures of General Lee all show him with beard and  mustache)    \"Miss Ella died two years ago. I was sick in the hospital but the doctor  come to tell me. I couldn't go to her buryin'. I sure missed her.  (Poignant grief moistens Betty's eyes and thickens her voice). There  wasn't ever no one like her. Miss Kate an' young Miss Julia still live  at 'the house' with their brother, Marse Lucian (all children of the  first Beverly Jones and 'old Miss Julia',) but it don't seem right with  Miss Ella gone. Life seems dif'rent, some how, 'though there' lots of my  young white folks an' my own kin livin' round an' they're real good to  me. But Miss Ella's gone!    \"Goodday, Ma'am. Come anytime. You're welcome to. I'm right glad to have  visitors 'cause I can't get out much.\" A bobbing little curtsy  accompanies Betty's cordial farewell.    Although a freed woman for 71 years, property owner for half of them,  and now revered head of a clan of self respecting, self-supporting  colored citizens, she is still at heart a \"Jones negro,\" and all the  distinguished descendants of her beloved Marse Beverly and Miss Julia  will be her \"own folks\" as long as she lives.

The continuation  along the similar valley to the south, in Maryland and Virginia, was a  natural one, especially as the increasing tide of emigrants raised the  price of lands.[100:4] In 1719 the proprietor's price for Pennsylvania  lands was ten pounds per hundred acres, and two shillings quit-rents. In  1732 this became fifteen and one-half pounds, with a quit-rent of a half  penny per acre.[101:1] During the period 1718 to 1732, when the Germans  were coming in great numbers, the management of the lands fell into  confusion, and many seated themselves as squatters, without  title.[101:2] This was a fortunate possibility for the poor  redemptioners, who had sold their service for a term of years in order  to secure their transportation to America.    By 1726 it was estimated that there were 100,000 squatters;[101:3] and  of the 670,000 acres occupied between 1732 and 1740, it is estimated  that 400,000 acres were settled without grants.[101:4] Nevertheless  these must ultimately be paid for, with interest, and the concession of  the right of preemption to squatters made this easier. But it was not  until 1755 that the governor offered land free from purchase, and this  was to be taken only west of the Alleghanies.[101:5]    Although the credit system relieved the difficulty in Pennsylvania, the  lands of that colony were in competition with the Maryland lands,  offered between 1717 and 1738 at forty shillings sterling per hundred  acres, which in 1738 was raised to five pounds sterling.[101:6] At the  same time, in the Virginia Valley, as will be recalled, free grants were  being made of a thousand acres per family. Although large tracts of the  Shenandoah Valley had been granted to speculators like Beverley,  Borden, and the Carters, as well as to Lord Fairfax, the owners sold  six or seven pounds cheaper per hundred acres than did the Pennsylvania  land office.[102:1] Between 1726 and 1734, therefore, the Germans began  to enter this valley,[102:2] and before long they extended their  settlements into the Piedmont of the Carolinas,[102:3] being recruited  in South Carolina by emigrants coming by way of Charleston--especially  after Governor Glenn's purchase from the Cherokee in 1755, of the  extreme western portion of the colony. Between 1750 and the Revolution,  these settlers in the Carolinas greatly increased in numbers.    Thus a zone of almost continuous German settlements had been  established, running from the head of the Mohawk in New York to the  Savannah in Georgia. They had found the best soils, and they knew how to  till them intensively and thriftily, as attested by their large,  well-filled barns, good stock, and big canvas-covered Conestoga wagons.  They preferred to dwell in groups, often of the same religious  denomination--Lutherans, Reformed, Moravians, Mennonites, and many  lesser sects. The diaries of Moravian missionaries from Pennsylvania,  who visited them, show how the parent congregations kept in touch with  their colonies[102:4] and how intimate, in general, was the bond of  connection between this whole German frontier zone and that of  Pennsylvania.    Side by side with this German occupation of Valley and Piedmont, went  the migration of the Scotch-Irish.[103:1] These lowland Scots had been  planted in Ulster early in the seventeenth century. Followers of John  Knox, they had the contentious individualism and revolutionary temper  that seem natural to Scotch Presbyterianism. They were brought up on the  Old Testament, and in the doctrine of government by covenant or compact.  In Ireland their fighting qualities had been revealed in the siege of  Londonderry, where their stubborn resistance balked the hopes of James  II. However, religious and political disabilities were imposed upon  these Ulstermen, which made them discontented, and hard times  contributed to detach them from their homes. Their movement to America  was contemporaneous with the heavy German migration. By the Revolution,  it is believed that a third of the population of Pennsylvania was  Scotch-Irish; and it has been estimated, probably too liberally, that a  half million came to the United States between 1730 and 1770.[103:2]  Especially after the Rebellion of 1745, large numbers of Highlanders  came to increase the Scotch blood in the nation.[103:3] Some of the  Scotch-Irish went to New England.[103:4] Given the cold shoulder by  congregational Puritans, they passed to unsettled lands about Worcester,  to the frontier in the Berkshires, and in southern New Hampshire at  Londonderry--whence came John Stark, a frontier leader in the French  and Indian War, and the hero of Bennington in the Revolution, as well as  the ancestors of Horace Greeley and S. P. Chase. In New York, a  Scotch-Irish settlement was planted on the frontier at Cherry  Valley.[104:1] Scotch Highlanders came to the Mohawk,[104:2] where they  followed Sir William Johnson and became Tory raiders in the Revolution.    But it was in Pennsylvania that the center of Scotch-Irish power lay.  \"These bold and indigent strangers, saying as their excuse when  challenged for titles that we had solicited for colonists and they had  come accordingly,\"[104:3] and asserting that \"it was against the laws of  God and nature that so much land should be idle while so many christians  wanted it to work on and to raise their bread,\" squatted on the vacant  lands, especially in the region disputed between Pennsylvania and  Maryland, and remained in spite of efforts to drive them off. Finding  the Great Valley in the hands of the Germans, they planted their own  outposts along the line of the Indian trading path from Lancaster to  Bedford; they occupied Cumberland Valley, and before 1760 pressed up the  Juniata somewhat beyond the narrows, spreading out along its  tributaries, and by 1768 had to be warned off from the Redstone country  to avoid Indian trouble. By the time of the Revolution, their  settlements made Pittsburgh a center from which was to come a new era in  Pennsylvania history. It was the Scotch-Irish and German  fur-traders[104:4] whose pack trains pioneered into the Ohio Valley in  the days before the French and Indian wars. The messengers between  civilization and savagery were such men,[105:1] as the Irish Croghan,  and the Germans Conrad Weiser and Christian Post.    Like the Germans, the Scotch-Irish passed into the Shenandoah  Valley,[105:2] and on to the uplands of the South. In 1738 a delegation  of the Philadelphia Presbyterian synod was sent to the Virginia governor  and received assurances of security of religious freedom; the same  policy was followed by the Carolinas. By 1760 a zone of Scotch-Irish  Presbyterian churches extended from the frontiers of New England to the  frontiers of South Carolina. This zone combined in part with the German  zone, but in general Scotch-Irishmen tended to follow the valleys  farther toward the mountains, to be the outer edge of this frontier.  Along with this combined frontier stream were English, Welsh and Irish  Quakers, and French Huguenots.[105:3]    Among this moving mass, as it passed along the Valley into the Piedmont,  in the middle of the eighteenth century, were Daniel Boone, John Sevier,  James Robertson, and the ancestors of John C. Calhoun, Abraham Lincoln,  Jefferson Davis, Stonewall Jackson, James K. Polk, Sam Houston, and Davy  Crockett, while the father of Andrew Jackson came to the Carolina  Piedmont at the same time from the coast. Recalling that Thomas  Jefferson's home was on the frontier, at the edge of the Blue Ridge, we  perceive that these names represent the militant expansive movement in  American life. They foretell the settlement across the Alleghanies in  Kentucky and Tennessee; the Louisiana Purchase, and Lewis and Clark's  transcontinental exploration; the conquest of the Gulf Plains in the  War of 1812-15; the annexation of Texas; the acquisition of California  and the Spanish Southwest. They represent, too, frontier democracy in  its two aspects personified in Andrew Jackson and Abraham Lincoln. It  was a democracy responsive to leadership, susceptible to waves of  emotion, of a \"high religeous voltage\"--quick and direct in action.    The volume of this Northern movement into the Southern uplands is  illustrated by the statement of Governor Tryon, of North Carolina, that  in the summer and winter of 1765 more than a thousand immigrant wagons  passed through Salisbury, in that colony.[106:1] Coming by families, or  groups of families or congregations, they often drove their herds with  them. Whereas in 1746 scarce a hundred fighting men were found in Orange  and the western counties of North Carolina, there were in 1753 fully  three thousand, in addition to over a thousand Scotch in the Cumberland;  and they covered the province more or less thickly, from Hillsboro and  Fayetteville to the mountains.[106:2] Bassett remarks that the  Presbyterians received their first ministers from the synod of New York  and Pennsylvania, and later on sent their ministerial students to  Princeton College. \"Indeed it is likely that the inhabitants of this  region knew more about Philadelphia at that time than about Newbern or  Edenton.\"[106:3]    We are now in a position to note briefly, in conclusion, some of the  results of the occupation of this new frontier during the first half of  the eighteenth century--some of the consequences of this formation of  the Old West.
