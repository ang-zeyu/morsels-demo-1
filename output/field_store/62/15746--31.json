If, after this, we contemplate       those wide fields of aether, that reach in height as far as       from Saturn to the fixed stars, and run abroad almost to an       infinitude, our imagination finds its capacity filled with       so immense a prospect, as puts it upon the stretch to       comprehend it. But if we yet rise higher, and consider the       fixed stars as so many vast oceans of flame, that are each       of them attended with a different set of planets, and still       discover new firmaments and new lights, that are sunk       farther in those unfathomable depths of aether, so as not to       be seen by the strongest of our telescopes, we are lost in       such a labyrinth of suns and worlds, and confounded with the       immensity and magnificence of nature.         \"Nothing is more pleasant to the fancy, than to enlarge       itself by degrees, in its contemplation of the various       proportions which its several objects bear to each other,       when it compares the body of man to the bulk of the whole       earth, the earth to the circle it describes round the sun,       that circle to the sphere of the fixed stars, the sphere of       the fixed stars to the circuit of the whole creation, the       whole creation itself to the infinite space that is       everywhere diffused around it; ... But if, after all this,       we take the least particle of these animal spirits, and       consider its capacity wrought into a world, that shall       contain within those narrow dimensions a heaven and earth,       stars and planets, and every different species of living       creatures, in the same analogy and proportion they bear to       each other in our own universe; such a speculation, by       reason of its nicety, appears ridiculous to those who have       not turned their thoughts that way, though, at the same       time, it is founded on no less than the evidence of a       demonstration.\"[375]    [Footnote 374: Pope: _Works_, VI, 110.]    [Footnote 375: Addison: _Spectator_, No. 420, (IV, 372-373). An  interesting contrast to this passage and a good illustration of how  the traditional phraseology continued in poetry is found in Addison's  famous hymn, written a year later:        \"Whilst all the stars that round her [earth] burn      And all the planets in their turn,      Confirm the tidings as they roll,      And spread the truth from pole to pole.        \"What though in solemn silence all      Move round this dark terrestrial ball;      What though no real voice nor sound      Amidst their radiant orbs be found;        \"In reason's ear they all rejoice,      And utter forth a glorious voice;      Forever singing, as they shine,      'The hand that made us is divine'.\"]    A little later, Cotton Mather declared (1721) that the \"Copernican  hypothesis is now generally preferred,\" and \"that there is no  objection against the motion of the earth but what has had a full  solution.\"[376] Soon the semi-popular scientific books took up the  Newtonian astronomy. One such was described as \"useful for all  sea-faring Men, as well as Gentlemen, and Others.\"[377]  \"Newtonianisme pour les Dames\" was advertised in France in the  forties.[378] By 1738 when Pope wrote the _Universal Prayer_:        \"Yet not to earth's contracted span        Thy goodness let me bound      Or think thee Lord alone of man,        When thousand worlds are round,\"    the Copernican-Newtonian astronomy had become a commonplace to most  well-educated people in England. To be sure, the great John Wesley  (1770) considered the systems of the universe merely \"ingenious  conjectures,\" but then, he doubted whether \"more than Probabilities we  shall ever attain in regard to things at so great a distance from  us.\"[379]    [Footnote 376: Mather: _Christian Philosopher_, 75, 76.]    [Footnote 377: Leadbetter: _Astronomy_ (1729).]    [Footnote 378: In de Maupertius: _Ouvrages Divers_, (at the back).]    [Footnote 379: Wesley: _Compendium of Natural Philosophy_, I, 14,  139.]    The old phraseology, however, did recur occasionally, especially in  poetry and in hymns. For instance, a hymnal (preface dated 1806)  contains such choice selections as:        \"Before the pondr'ous earthly globe        In fluid air was stay'd,      Before the ocean's mighty springs        Their liquid stores display'd\"--    and:        \"Who led his blest unerring hand        Or lent his needful aid      When on its strong unshaken base        The pondr'ous earth was laid?\"[380]    [Footnote 380: Dobell: _Hymns_, No. 5, No. 10.]    But too much importance should not be attributed to such passages;  though poetry and astronomy need not conflict, as Keble  illustrated:[381]        \"Ye Stars that round the Sun of Righteousness        In glorious order roll....\"    [Footnote 381: Keble: _Christian Year_, 279.]    By the middle of the 18th century in England, one could say with Horne  \"that the Newtonian System had been in possession of the chair for  some years;\"[382] but it had not yet convinced the common people, for  as Pike wrote in 1753, \"Many Common Christians to this day firmly  believe that the earth really stands still and that the sun moves all  round the earth once a day: neither can they be easily persuaded out  of this opinion, because they look upon themselves bound to believe  what the Scripture asserts.\"[383]    [Footnote 382: Horne: _Fair, Candid, Impartial Statement ..._, 4.]    [Footnote 383: Pike: _Philosophia Sacra_, 43.]    There was, however, just at this time a little group of thinkers who  objected to Newton's scheme, \"because of the endless uninterrupted  flux of matter from the sun in light, an expense which should destroy  that orb.\"[384] These Hutchinsonians conceived of light as pure ether  in motion springing forth from the sun, growing more dense the further  it goes till it becomes air, and, striking the circumference of the  universe (which is perhaps an immovable solid), is thrown back toward  the sun and melted into light again. Its force as its tides of motion  strike the earth and the other planets produces their constant  gyrations.[385] Men like Duncan Forbes, Lord President of the Court of  Sessions, and George Horne, President of Magdalen College, Oxford, as  a weapon against rationalism, favored this notion that had been  expounded by John Hutchinson (1674-1737) in his _Moses's Principia_  (1724).[386] They were also strongly attracted by the scriptural  symbolism with which the book abounds. Leslie Stephen summarizes their  doctrines as (1) extreme dislike for rationalism, (2) a fanatical  respect for the letter of the Bible, and (3) an attempt to enlist the  rising powers of scientific enquiry upon the side of orthodoxy.[387]  This \"little eddy of thought\"[388] was not of much influence even at  that time, but it has a certain interest as indicating the positions  men have taken when on the defensive against new ideas.    [Footnote 384: Forbes: _Letter_, (1755).]    [Footnote 385: See Wesley: I, 136-7.]    [Footnote 386: _Dict. of Nat. Biog._: \"Hutchinson.\"]    [Footnote 387: Stephen: _Hist. of Eng. Thought_: I, 390.]    [Footnote 388: Ibid: 391.]          CHAPTER V.    THE CHURCH AND THE NEW ASTRONOMY: CONCLUSION.      Astronomical thought on the Continent was more hampered, in the  Catholic countries especially, by the restrictive opinions of the  Church. Yet in 1757, when the decree prohibiting all books dealing  with the Copernican doctrine was removed from the Index, that system  had already long been adopted by the more celebrated academies of  Europe, for so Mme. de Premontval claimed in 1750; and it was then  reaching out to non-scientific readers, through simple accounts for  \"ladies and others not well versed in these somewhat technical  matters.\"[389] The great landmark in the development of the doctrine  was the publication of Newton's _Principia_ in 1687, though its effect  in Europe was of course slower in being felt than it was in England.  Newton's work and that of the astronomers immediately following him  was influential except where the Church's prohibitions still held  sway.    [Footnote 389: de Premontval: _Le Mechaniste Philosophe_, 54, 72. (The  Hague, 1750).]    During this period, the books published in free Holland were more  outspoken in their radical acceptance or in their uncertainty of the  truth than were those published in the Catholic countries. Christian  Huygens's treatises on the plurality of worlds not only fully accepted  the Copernican doctrine, but like those of Bishop Wilkins in England,  deduced therefrom the probability that the other planets are inhabited  even as the earth is. A writer[390] on the sphere in 1697 stated the  different theories of the universe so that his readers might choose  the one that to them appeared the most probable. He himself preferred  the Cartesian explanation as the simplest and most convenient of all,  \"though it should be held merely as an hypothesis and not as in  absolute agreement with the truth.\" Pierre Bayle[391] also explained  the different systems, but appears himself to waver between the  Copernican and the Tychonic conceptions. He used, however, the old  word \"perigee\" (nearness to the earth) rather than the Newtonian  \"perihelion\" (nearness to the sun). His objections to the Copernican  doctrine have a familiar ring: It is contrary to the evidence of the  senses; a stone would not fall back to its starting-place, nor could a  bird return to her nest; the earth would not be equidistant from the  horizon and the two poles; and lastly it is contrary to the  Scriptures. Only a few years later, however, De Maupertius wrote that  no one at that day (1744) doubted any longer the motion of the earth  around"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3580"],[0,"Recollections of the Private Life of Napoleon — Complete (#20)"],[1,"in order that their port, which he always  called the port of Paris, might reach the highest degree of prosperity,  and did the sub-prefect, the mayor, the two presidents of the tribunals,  the commandant of the place, and the chief of the tenth demi-brigade of  light infantry the honor of inviting them to his table.    In the evening the First Consul went to the theater, where they played a  piece composed for the occasion, about as admirable as such pieces  usually are, but on which the First Consul and Madame Bonaparte  especially complimented the authors. The illuminations were more  brilliant even than on the evening before; and I remember especially that  the largest number of transparencies bore the inscription, 18th Brumaire,  year VIII.    Sunday, at seven o'clock in the morning, after having visited the Marine  Arsenal and all the docks, the weather being very fine, the First Consul  embarked in a little barge, and remained in the roadstead for several  hours, escorted by a large number of barges filled with men and elegantly  dressed women, and musicians playing the favorite airs of the First  Consul. Then a few hours were again passed in the reception of  merchants, the First Consul assuring them that he had taken the greatest  pleasure in conferring with them in regard to the commerce of Havre with  the colonies. In the evening, there was a fete prepared by the  merchants, at which the First Consul remained for half an hour; and on  Monday, at five o'clock in the morning, he embarked on a lugger for  Honfleur. At the time of his departure the weather was a little  threatening, and the First Consul was advised not to embark. Madame  Bonaparte, whose ears this rumor reached, ran after her husband, begging  him not to set out; but he embraced her, laughing, calling her a coward,  and entered the vessel which was awaiting him. He had hardly embarked  when the wind suddenly lulled, and the weather became very fine. On his  return to Havre, the First Consul held a review on the Place de la  Citadelle, and visited the artillery barracks, after which he received,  until the evening, a large number of public dignitaries and merchants;  and the next day, at six o'clock in the morning, we set out for Dieppe.    When we arrived at Fecamp, the town presented an extremely singular  spectacle. All the inhabitants of the town, and of the adjoining towns  and villages, followed the clergy, chanting a Te Deum for the anniversary  of the 18th Brumaire; and these countless voices rising to heaven for him  affected the First Consul profoundly. He repeated several times during  breakfast that he had felt more emotion on hearing these chants under the  dome of heaven than he had ever felt while listening to the most  brilliant music.    We arrived at Dieppe at six o'clock in the evening. The First Consul  retired, only after having received all their felicitations, which were  certainly very sincere there, as throughout all France at that time. The  next day, at eight o'clock, the First Consul repaired to the harbor,  where he remained a long while watching the return of the fishermen, and  afterwards visited the faubourg of Pollet, and the work on the docks,  which was then just beginning. He admitted to his table the sub-prefect,  the mayor, and three sailors of Dieppe who had been given boarding-axes  of honor for distinguishing themselves in the combat off Boulogne. He  ordered the construction of a breakwater in the inner port, and the  continuation of a canal for navigation, which was to be extended as far  as Paris, and of which, until this present time, only a few fathoms have  been made. From Dieppe we went to Gisors and to Beauvais; and finally  the First Consul and his wife returned to Saint-Cloud, after an absence  of two weeks, during which workmen had been busily employed in restoring  the ancient royal residence, which the First Consul had decided to  accept, as I have before stated.          CHAPTER X.    The tour of the First Consul through the wealthiest and most enlightened  departments of France had removed from his mind the apprehension of many  difficulties which he had feared at first in the execution of his plans.  Everywhere he had been treated as a monarch, and not only he personally,  but Madame Bonaparte also, had been received with all the honors usually  reserved for crowned heads. There was no difference between the homage  offered them at this time, and that which they received later, even  during the Empire, when their Majesties made tours of their states at  different times. For this reason I shall give some details; and if they  should seem too long, or not very novel, the reader will remember that I  am not writing only for those who lived during the Empire. The  generation which witnessed such great deeds, and which, under their very  eyes, and from the beginning of his career, saw the greatest man of this  century, has already given place to another generation, which can judge  him only by what others may narrate of him. What may be familiar to  those who saw with their own eyes is not so to others, who can only take  at second-hand those things which they had no opportunity of seeing for  themselves. Besides, details omitted as frivolous or commonplace by  history, which makes a profession of more gravity, are perfectly  appropriate in simple memoirs, and often enable one to understand and  judge the epoch more correctly. For instance, it seems to me that the  enthusiasm displayed by the entire population and all the local  authorities for the First Consul and his wife during their tour in  Normandy showed clearly that the chief of the state would have no great  opposition to fear, certainly none on the part of the nation, whenever it  should please him to change his title, and proclaim himself Emperor.    Soon after our return, by a decree of the consuls four ladies were  assigned to Madame Bonaparte to assist her in doing the honors of the  palace. They were Mesdames de Remusat, de Tallouet, de Lucay, and de  Lauriston. Under the Empire they became ladies-in-waiting. Madame de  Lauriston often raised a smile by little exhibitions of parsimony, but  she was good and obliging. Madame de Remusat possessed great merit, and  had sound judgment, though she appeared somewhat haughty, which was the  more remarkable as M. de Remusat was exactly the reverse. Subsequently  there was another lady of honor, Madame de La Rochefoucault, of whom I  shall have occasion to speak later.    The lady of the robes, Madame de Lucay, was succeeded by Madame La  Vallette, so gloriously known afterwards by her devotion to her husband.  There were twenty-four French ladies-in-waiting, among whom were Mesdames  de Remusat, de Tallouet, de Lauriston, Ney, d'Arberg, Louise d'Arberg  (afterwards the Countess of Lobau), de Walsh-Serent, de Colbert, Lannes,  Savary, de Turenne, Octave de Segur, de Montalivet, de Marescot, de  Bouille Solar, Lascaris, de Brignole, de Canisy, de Chevreuse, Victor de  Mortemart, de Montmorency, Matignon, and Maret. There were also twelve  Italian ladies-in-waiting.    These ladies served in turn one month each, there being thus two French  and one Italian lady on duty together. The Emperor at first did not  admit unmarried ladies among the ladies-in-waiting; but he relaxed this  rule first in favor of Mademoiselle Louise d'Arberg (afterwards Countess  of Lobau), and then in favor of Mademoiselle de Lucay, who has since  married Count Philip de Segur, author of the excellent history of the  campaign in Russia; and these two young ladies by their prudence and  circumspect conduct proved themselves above criticism even at court.    There were four lady ushers, Mesdames Soustras, Ducrest-Villeneuve,  Felicite Longroy, and Egle Marchery.    Two first ladies' maids, Mesdames Roy and Marco de St. Hilaire, who had  under their charge the grand wardrobe and the jewel-box.    There were four ladies' maids in ordinary.    A lady reader.    The men on the staff of the Empress's household were the following:  A grand equerry, Senator Harville, who discharged the duties of a  chevalier of honor.    A head chamberlain, the general of division, Nansouty.    A vice-chamberlain, introducer of the ambassadors, de Beaumont.    Four chamberlains in ordinary, de Courtomer, Degrave, Galard de Bearn,  Hector d'Aubusson de la Feuillade.    Four equerries, Corbineau, Berckheim, d'Audenarde, and Fouler.    A superintendent-general of her Majesty's household, Hinguerlot.    A secretary of commands, Deschamps.    Two head valets, Frere and Douville.    Four valets in ordinary.    Four men servants.    Two head footmen, L'Esperance and d'Argens. Six ordinary footmen. The  staff of the kitchen and sanitation were the same as in the household of  the Emperor; and besides these, six pages of the Emperor were always in  attendance upon the Empress.    The chief almoner was Ferdinand de Rohan, former archbishop of Cambray.    Another decree of the same date fixed the duties of the prefects of the  palace. The four head prefects of the consular palace were de Remusat,  de Crayamel (afterwards appointed introduces of ambassadors, and master  of ceremonies), de Lugay, and Didelot. The latter subsequently became  prefect of the Department of the Cher.    Malmaison was no longer sufficient for the First Consul, whose household,  like that of Madame Bonaparte, became daily more numerous. A much larger  building had become necessary, and the First Consul fixed his choice upon  Saint-Cloud.    The inhabitants of Saint-Cloud addressed a petition to the Corps  Legislatif, praying that the First Consul would make their chateau his  summer residence; and this body hastened to transmit it to him, adding  their prayers to the same effect, and making comparisons which they  believed would be agreeable to him. The general refused formally, saying  that when he should have finished and laid down the duties with which"]]]
