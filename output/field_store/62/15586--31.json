Industry is  concentrated mainly in the populous Flemish area in the north, although  the government is encouraging reinvestment in the southern region  of Walloon. With few natural resources Belgium must import essential raw  materials, making its economy closely dependent on the state of world  markets. Over 70% of trade is with other EC countries. During  the period 1988-90 Belgium's economic performance was marked by buoyant  output growth, moderate inflation, and a substantial external surplus.  Real GDP grew by an average of 3.9% in 1988-90. However, the economy  is likely to slow in 1991-92 to below 3% GDP growth.      _#_GDP: $144.8 billion, per capita $14,600; real growth rate 3.3%  (1990)      _#_Inflation rate (consumer prices): 3% (1991 est.)      _#_Unemployment rate: 8.2% est.

It was not like anything the  child had ever heard, but as the man recalled it to his memory, he knew  to what song it might be compared--to a certain chant indeed that  summons the angels and archangels to assist in the great Sacrifice. But  as this song chants of the heavenly army, so did that seem to summon all  the hierarchy of evil, the hosts of Lilith and Samael; and the words  that rang out with such awful modulations--_neumata inferorum_--were in  some unknown tongue that few men have ever heard on earth.    The women glared at one another with horror in their eyes, and he saw  one or two of the oldest of them clumsily making an old sign upon their  breasts. Then they began to speak again, and he remembered fragments of  their talk.    'She has been up there,' said one, pointing vaguely over her shoulder.    'She'd never know the way,' answered another. 'They be all gone that  went there.'    'There be nought there in these days.'    'How can you tell that, Gwenllian? 'Tis not for us to say that.'    'My great-grandmother did know some that had been there,' said a very  old woman. 'She told me how they was taken afterwards.'    And then his uncle appeared at the door, and they went their way as they  had come. Edward Darnell never heard any more of it, nor whether the  girl died or recovered from her strange attack; but the scene had  haunted his mind in boyhood, and now the recollection of it came to him  with a certain note of warning, as a symbol of dangers that might be in  the way.           *       *       *       *       *    It would be impossible to carry on the history of Edward Darnell and of  Mary his wife to a greater length, since from this point their legend is  full of impossible events, and seems to put on the semblance of the  stories of the Graal. It is certain, indeed, that in this world they  changed their lives, like King Arthur, but this is a work which no  chronicler has cared to describe with any amplitude of detail. Darnell,  it is true, made a little book, partly consisting of queer verse which  might have been written by an inspired infant, and partly made up of  'notes and exclamations' in an odd dog-Latin which he had picked up  from the 'Iolo MSS.', but it is to be feared that this work, even if  published in its entirety, would cast but little light on a perplexing  story. He called this piece of literature 'In Exitu Israel,' and wrote  on the title page the motto, doubtless of his own composition, '_Nunc  certe scio quod omnia legenda; omnes historiae, omnes fabulae, omnis  Scriptura sint de ME narrata_.' It is only too evident that his Latin  was not learnt at the feet of Cicero; but in this dialect he relates the  great history of the 'New Life' as it was manifested to him. The 'poems'  are even stranger. One, headed (with an odd reminiscence of  old-fashioned books) 'Lines written on looking down from a Height in  London on a Board School suddenly lit up by the Sun' begins thus:--        One day when I was all alone      I found a wondrous little stone,      It lay forgotten on the road      Far from the ways of man's abode.      When on this stone mine eyes I cast      I saw my Treasure found at last.      I pressed it hard against my face,      I covered it with my embrace,      I hid it in a secret place.      And every day I went to see      This stone that was my ecstasy;      And worshipped it with flowers rare,      And secret words and sayings fair.      O stone, so rare and red and wise      O fragment of far Paradise,      O Star, whose light is life! O Sea,      Whose ocean is infinity!      Thou art a fire that ever burns,      And all the world to wonder turns;      And all the dust of the dull day      By thee is changed and purged away,      So that, where'er I look, I see      A world of a Great Majesty.      The sullen river rolls all gold,      The desert park's a faery wold,      When on the trees the wind is borne      I hear the sound of Arthur's horn      I see no town of grim grey ways,      But a great city all ablaze      With burning torches, to light up      The pinnacles that shrine the Cup.      Ever the magic wine is poured,      Ever the Feast shines on the board,      Ever the song is borne on high      That chants the holy Magistry--        Etc. etc. etc.    From such documents as these it is clearly impossible to gather any very  definite information. But on the last page Darnell has written--    'So I awoke from a dream of a London suburb, of daily labour, of weary,  useless little things; and as my eyes were opened I saw that I was in an  ancient wood, where a clear well rose into grey film and vapour beneath  a misty, glimmering heat. And a form came towards me from the hidden  places of the wood, and my love and I were united by the well.'          The White People      PROLOGUE    'Sorcery and sanctity,' said Ambrose, 'these are the only realities.  Each is an ecstasy, a withdrawal from the common life.'    Cotgrave listened, interested. He had been brought by a friend to this  mouldering house in a northern suburb, through an old garden to the room  where Ambrose the recluse dozed and dreamed over his books.    'Yes,' he went on, 'magic is justified of her children. There are many,  I think, who eat dry crusts and drink water, with a joy infinitely  sharper than anything within the experience of the \"practical\" epicure.'    'You are speaking of the saints?'    'Yes, and of the sinners, too. I think you are falling into the very  general error of confining the spiritual world to the supremely good;  but the supremely wicked, necessarily, have their portion in it. The  merely carnal, sensual man can no more be a great sinner than he can be  a great saint. Most of us are just indifferent, mixed-up creatures; we  muddle through the world without realizing the meaning and the inner  sense of things, and, consequently, our wickedness and our goodness are  alike second-rate, unimportant.'    'And you think the great sinner, then, will be an ascetic, as well as  the great saint?'    'Great people of all kinds forsake the imperfect copies and go to the  perfect originals. I have no doubt but that many of the very highest  among the saints have never done a \"good action\" (using the words in  their ordinary sense). And, on the other hand, there have been those who  have sounded the very depths of sin, who all their lives have never done  an \"ill deed.\"'    He went out of the room for a moment, and Cotgrave, in high delight,  turned to his friend and thanked him for the introduction.    'He's grand,' he said. 'I never saw that kind of lunatic before.'    Ambrose returned with more whisky and helped the two men in a liberal  manner. He abused the teetotal sect with ferocity, as he handed the  seltzer, and pouring out a glass of water for himself, was about to  resume his monologue, when Cotgrave broke in--    'I can't stand it, you know,' he said, 'your paradoxes are too  monstrous. A man may be a great sinner and yet never do anything sinful!  Come!'    'You're quite wrong,' said Ambrose. 'I never make paradoxes; I wish I  could. I merely said that a man may have an exquisite taste in Romanee  Conti, and yet never have even smelt four ale. That's all, and it's more  like a truism than a paradox, isn't it? Your surprise at my remark is  due to the fact that you haven't realized what sin is. Oh, yes, there is  a sort of connexion between Sin with the capital letter, and actions  which are commonly called sinful: with murder, theft, adultery, and so  forth. Much the same connexion that there is between the A, B, C and  fine literature. But I believe that the misconception--it is all but  universal--arises in great measure from our looking at the matter  through social spectacles. We think that a man who does evil to _us_ and  to his neighbours must be very evil. So he is, from a social standpoint;  but can't you realize that Evil in its essence is a lonely thing, a  passion of the solitary, individual soul? Really, the average murderer,  _qua_ murderer, is not by any means a sinner in the true sense of the  word. He is simply a wild beast that we have to get rid of to save our  own necks from his knife. I should class him rather with tigers than  with sinners.'    'It seems a little strange.'    'I think not. The murderer murders not from positive qualities, but from  negative ones; he lacks something which non-murderers possess. Evil, of  course, is wholly positive--only it is on the wrong side. You may  believe me that sin in its proper sense is very rare; it is probable  that there have been far fewer sinners than saints. Yes, your standpoint  is all very well for practical, social purposes; we are naturally  inclined to think that a person who is very disagreeable to us must be a  very great sinner! It is very disagreeable to have one's pocket picked,  and we pronounce the thief to be a very great sinner. In truth, he is  merely an undeveloped man. He cannot be a saint, of course; but he may  be, and often is, an infinitely better creature than thousands who have  never broken a single commandment. He is a great nuisance to _us_, I  admit, and we very properly lock him up if we catch him; but between his  troublesome and unsocial action and evil--Oh, the connexion is of the  weakest.'    It was getting very late. The man who had brought Cotgrave had probably  heard all this before, since he assisted with a bland and judicious  smile, but Cotgrave began to think that his 'lunatic' was turning into a  sage.    'Do you know,' he said, 'you interest me immensely? You think, then,  that we do not understand the real nature of evil?'    'No, I don't think we do. We over-estimate it and we under-estimate it.  We take the very numerous infractions of our social \"bye-laws\"--the"]]]
