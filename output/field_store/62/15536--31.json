As Tristan approached the shore he found his countrymen, some on board  the caravel, some on the sea-shore looking at the ships, and others  scattered about the houses, when suddenly a vast number of Indians  rushed forward with yells and howls, launching their javelins through  the windows and roofs, or thrusting them through the crevices of the  woodwork, wounding some of those who were within.    At the first alarm the Adelantado, seizing a lance, sallied forth with  seven or eight men, and being joined by Diego Mendez and others, they  drove the enemy into the forest, killing and wounding many of them.  In  spite of their furious sallies the savages could not withstand the keen  edge of the Spanish swords and the attacks of a fierce bloodhound, and  fled howling through the forest, leaving a number dead on the field,  having, however, killed one Spaniard and wounded eight, among the latter  of whom was the Adelantado.    Tristan had been afraid to approach the land lest his countrymen should  spring on board and sink the boat, and when the Indians had been put to  flight he proceeded up the river in quest of fresh water, disregarding  the warnings of his friends on shore.  He had get up some way, and was  passing through a narrow channel between high, rocky, and wooded banks,  when he was suddenly assailed by showers of darts and arrows.  As the  crew, losing all presence of mind, made no attempt to row away, only  covering themselves with their bucklers, in a short time he and the  whole of them, with the exception of one man, were massacred.  The  survivor, springing overboard, gained the bank of the river unperceived,  and made his way down to the settlement with the tidings of the death of  his captain and comrades.    The Spaniards were dismayed.  They were few in number in the midst of  exasperated savages.  The Admiral, ignorant of their misfortunes, they  said, would sail away, and leave them to perish.  In vain the Adelantado  remonstrated.  They insisted on embarking in the caravel and following  Columbus.  The water, however, had fallen, and she could not be got over  the bar.  They attempted to put off in the boat, but a heavy surf  rolling on the shore made this impossible.    In the meantime the Indians, instigated by Quibian, who had escaped,  again attacked the Spaniards, rushing out from their coverts in the  woods, and hurling their javelins and darts.  As the huts were so near  the woods that they might at any moment be surprised, a spot was chosen  on the shore, where a breastwork was thrown up formed of the boats,  casks, and cases, in the embrasures of which were placed two small  pieces of artillery.  Here, when the Indians came on, they were received  with so warm a fire from the arquebuses and guns that they quickly took  to flight.  The little garrison knew, however, that before long their  ammunition would fail and their provisions be exhausted, and that they  could anticipate nothing but destruction in the end.    Columbus all this time was not aware what was taking place on shore.  He  became anxious, however, at the non-appearance of Diego Tristan and his  party, but as there was one boat only remaining, he was afraid of  sending her off lest she should be overwhelmed by the surf breaking on  the beach.    A fearful circumstance now occurred.  The prisoners were confined at  night in the forecastle of the caravel, the hatchway of which was  generally secured by a strong chain and padlock.  Several of the crew  slept on this hatchway, and as it was so high as to be considered out of  the reach of those beneath, they neglected to fasten the chain.    The Indians, discovering their negligence, made a heap of stones from  the ballast directly under the hatchway.  Several of their most powerful  warriors then mounting on the top, and bending their backs, by a sudden  effort forced up the hatch.  In an instant the greater part of the  Indians sprang forth, some plunging into the sea and swimming for the  shore.  Several were seized and forced back into the forecastle, when  the hatchway was chained down and a guard was set for the remainder of  the night.    In the morning the Spaniards, on lifting the hatch, found to their  horror that their captives were all dead.  Some had hanged themselves  with the ends of ropes, their knees touching the floor, while others lay  strangled, having drawn the ropes tight with their feet.  Columbus,  fearing that the prisoners who had escaped would stimulate their  countrymen to some act of vengeance, was anxious to communicate with his  brother.  It still seemed impossible for the boat to reach the shore,  when Pedro Ledesma, a pilot of Seville, volunteered to swim to the beach  if the boat would carry him outside the breakers and wait his return.    Stripping himself, he plunged into the sea, and buffeting the surges,  reached the shore.  He here found the intended settlers verging on  despair, and also heard the fate of Diego Tristan.    With a message from the Adelantado, the brave pilot made his way back to  the boat.  Columbus, on receiving the alarming intelligence brought by  the pilot, was thrown into a state of the greatest anxiety.  Rather than  allow the settlement to be broken up, he would have joined the  Adelantado with all his people; but how, then, could he send tidings of  his important discovery to the sovereigns?  After much trouble of mind  he resolved to embark the people and abandon the settlement.    Bad weather and a heavy sea rendered this for a long time impossible.  At length the wind going down, the sea became calm, and he was able to  send the boat on shore.  Every exertion was at once made to bring off  the people.  The zealous Diego Mendez had been actively employed in  making sacks to hold the biscuit.  He also constructed a raft, which  greatly facilitated the conveyance of the stores, arms, and ammunition.    The caravel was also dismantled.  Her provisions and stores were got  off, so that nothing remained but her hull.  The joy of the Spaniards  when they found themselves safe on board was unbounded, and the Admiral,  as a reward for his services, gave the command of the caravel, vacant by  the death of the unfortunate Diego Tristan, to the zealous Diego Mendez.    By the end of April, with a favourable wind, Columbus left the  disastrous shores of Veragua; but his ships, honeycombed by the teredo,  could with difficulty be kept afloat.  To the surprise of his pilots,  instead of standing northwards towards Hispaniola, he steered due east,  knowing that the the current, which has a strong set into the Caribbean  Sea, would have swept him far away out of his intended course.    He continued on to Puerto Bello, where he found that one of his caravels  was so pierced by the teredo that he was compelled to leave her behind,  and to divide her crew between the two remaining vessels.  He then  proceeded on as far as what is now known as the Gulf of Darien.    Having struggled in vain against contrary winds and currents, he on the  ist of May stood northward in quest of Hispaniola.  As the wind was  easterly, with a strong current setting to the west, he kept as near the  wind as possible.  So ignorant were the pilots that they fancied all  this time that they were to the east of the Caribbean Islands, whereas  the Admiral feared truly that he should fall to the westward of  Hispaniola.    Sailing across the Caribbean Sea, he at length sighted two small islands  to the north-west of Hispaniola, which he called the Tortugas, from the  quantity of turtles seen about them, though now known as the Caymans.  Passing west of these, he found himself among the islands to the south  of Cuba which he had called the Queen's Gardens.  Here he cast anchor.  His crews were almost worn out, and the only provisions left were a  little biscuit, oil, and vinegar, while they were obliged to labour  incessantly at the pumps.    Suddenly a tempest burst upon them.  Three of their anchors were lost,  and the vessels, driving together, nearly knocked each other to pieces.  With the greatest difficulty they were separated, and the Admiral's ship  anchored with his sole remaining cable, which in the morning was found  nearly worn asunder.  At the end of six days, the weather moderating, he  sailed eastwards for Hispaniola.    Contrary winds, however, compelled him at length to stand across for  Jamaica, where, on the 23rd of June, the caravels put into Puerto Bueno,  now called Dry Harbour.  No natives being found, the following day they  sailed eastward, and entered another harbour, called Porta Santa Gloria.  Here, at length, Columbus was compelled to give up his arduous struggle  against the elements; his ships, reduced to mere wrecks, could no longer  be kept afloat, and he ordered them to be run aground within bowshot of  the shore, and fastened side by side.  Here they soon filled with water  to the deck.  Cabins were therefore erected at the bow and stern, for  the accommodation of the crews, and the vessels were placed in the best  possible state of defence against any sudden attack of the natives.    To prevent his men roving about the neighbourhood, he ordered that no  one should go on shore without a special licence, and every other  possible precaution was taken to prevent giving offence to the Indians.  Scarcely had these arrangements been made, than the natives appeared in  vast numbers, bringing provisions to barter.  That no disputes might  arise, two persons were appointed to superintend all such trading  transactions.  It was feared, however, that the food thus furnished  would soon fall short, in which case the Spaniards would be reduced to  famine.  In this emergency, Diego Mendez, with his accustomed zeal,  offered to set off "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23495"],[0,"The Story of the Greeks (#20)"],[1,"very wealthy, and as generous as he  was rich. Besides spending so much for the improvement of the city, he  always kept an open house. His table was bountifully spread, and he  gladly received as guests all who chose to walk into his home.    Whenever he went out, he was followed by servants who carried full  purses, and whose duty it was to help all the poor they met. As Cimon  knew that many of the most deserving poor would have been ashamed to  receive alms, these men found out their wants, and supplied them  secretly.    Now, although Cimon was so good and thoughtful, you must not imagine  that it was always very easy for him to be so. It seems that when he was  a young man he was very idle and lazy, and never thought of anything but  his own pleasure.    Aristides the Just noticed how lazy and selfish the young man was, and  one day went to see him. After a little talk, Aristides told him  seriously that he ought to be ashamed of the life he was living, as it  was quite unworthy of a good citizen or of a noble man.    This reproof was so just, that Cimon promised to do better, and tried so  hard that he soon became one of the most industrious and unselfish men  of his day.    Cimon was not the only rich man in Athens, however; for Per'i-cles,  another citizen, was even wealthier than he. As Pericles was shrewd,  learned, and very eloquent, he soon gained much influence over his  fellow-citizens.    While Cimon was generally seen in the company of men of his own class,  and was hence considered the leader of the nobles or aristocrats,  Pericles liked to talk with the poorer class, whom he could easily sway  by his eloquent speeches, and who soon made him their idol.    Day by day the two parties became more distinct, and soon the Athenians  sided either with Pericles or with Cimon in all important matters. The  two leaders were at first very good friends, but little by little they  drifted apart, and finally they became rivals.    About this time an earthquake brought great misfortunes upon Greece. The  whole country shook and swayed, and the effects of the earthquake were  so disastrous at Sparta that all the houses and temples were destroyed.    Many of the inhabitants were crushed under the falling stones and  timbers, and there were only five houses left standing. The Spartans  were in despair; and the Helots, or slaves, who had long been waiting  for an opportunity to free themselves, fancied that the right time had  come.    They quickly assembled, and decided to kill the Spartans while they were  groping about among the ruined dwellings for the remains of their  relatives and friends.    The plan would have succeeded had not the king, Ar-chi-da'mus, found it  out. Without a moment's delay, he rallied all the able-bodied men, and  sent a swift messenger to Athens for aid.    True to their military training, the Spartans dropped everything when  the summons reached them; and the Helots came marching along, only to  find their former masters drawn up in battle array, and as calm as if no  misfortune had happened.    This unexpected resistance so frightened the Helots, that they hastily  withdrew into Messenia. Here they easily persuaded the Messenians to  join forces with them and declare war against the Spartans.    In the mean while the swift runner sent by Archidamus had reached  Athens, and told about the destruction of the town and the perilous  situation of the people. He ended by imploring the Athenians to send  immediate aid, lest all the Spartans should perish.    Cimon, who was generous and kind-hearted, immediately cried out that the  Athenians could not refuse to help their unhappy neighbors; but  Pericles, who, like most of his fellow-citizens, hated the Spartans,  advised all his friends to stay quietly at home.    Much discussion took place over this advice. At last, however, Cimon  prevailed, and an army was sent to help the Spartans. Owing to the  hesitation of the Athenians, this army came late, and they fought with  so little spirit that the Lacedaemonians indignantly said that they might  just as well have remained at home.    This insult so enraged the Athenians that they went home; and when it  became publicly known how the Spartans had treated their army, the  people began to murmur against Cimon. In their anger, they forgot all  the good he had done them, and, assembling in the market place, they  ostracized him.          LVIII. THE AGE OF PERICLES.      As soon as Cimon had been banished, Pericles became sole leader of the  Athenians; and as he governed them during a long and prosperous time,  this period is generally known as the Age of Pericles.    The Spartans who had so rudely sent away their Athenian allies manfully  resolved to help themselves, and set about it so vigorously that they  soon brought the Helots back to order, and rebuilt their city. When they  had settled themselves comfortably, however, they remembered the  lukewarm help which had been given them, and determined to punish the  Athenians.    The Persian general was just then planning a new invasion of Greece, so  the Athenians found themselves threatened with a twofold danger. In  their distress they recalled Cimon, who was an excellent general, and  implored him to take command of their forces.    Cimon fully justified their confidence, and not only won several  victories over the Spartans, but compelled them at last to agree to a  truce of five years. This matter settled, he next attacked the Persians,  whom he soon defeated by land and by sea.    He then forced Artaxerxes, the Persian king, to swear a solemn oath that  he would never again wage war against the Athenians, and forbade the  Persian vessels ever to enter the AEgean Sea.    [Illustration: Pericles.]    These triumphs won, Cimon died from the wounds he had received during  the war. His death, however, was kept secret for a whole month, so that  the people would have time to get used to a new leader, and not be  afraid to fight without their former general.    While Cimon was thus successfully battling with the enemy abroad,  Pericles had managed affairs at home. He urged the Athenians to finish  their walls; and by his advice they built also the Long Walls, which  joined the city to the Pi-rae'us, a seaport five miles away.    Pericles also increased the Athenian navy, so that, by the time the  five-years' truce was over, he had a fine fleet to use in fighting  against the Spartans.    As every victory won by the Athenians had only made Sparta more jealous,  the war was renewed, and carried on with great fury on both sides. The  Spartans gained the first victories; but, owing to their better navy,  the Athenians soon won over all the neighboring cities, and got the  upper hand of their foes.    [Illustration: The Acropolis.]    They were about to end the war by a last victory at Cor-o-ne'a, when  fortune suddenly deserted them, and they were so sorely beaten that they  were very glad to agree to a truce and return home.    By the treaty then signed, the Athenians bound themselves to keep the  peace during a term of thirty years. In exchange, the Spartans allowed  them to retain the cities which they had conquered, and the leadership  of one of the confederacies formed by the Greek states, reserving the  head of the other for themselves.    During these thirty years of peace, Pericles was very busy, and his  efforts were directed for the most part toward the improvement of  Athens. By his advice a magnificent temple, the Par'the-non, was built  on top of the Acropolis, in honor of Athene.    This temple, one of the wonders of the world, was decorated with  beautiful carvings by Phidias, and all the rich Athenians went to see  them as soon as they were finished. This sculptor also made a  magnificent gold and ivory statue of the goddess, to stand in the midst  of the Parthenon. But in spite of all his talent, Phidias had many  enemies. After a while they wrongfully accused him of stealing part of  the gold intrusted to him. Phidias vainly tried to defend himself; but  they would not listen to him, and put him in prison, where he died.    Between the temple of Athene and the city there was a series of steps  and beautiful porticoes, decorated with paintings and sculptures, which  have never been surpassed.    Many other beautiful buildings were erected under the rule of Pericles;  and the beauty and art loving Athenians could soon boast that their city  was the finest in the world. Artists from all parts of the country  thronged thither in search of work, and all were well received by  Pericles.    [Illustration: Phidias.]          LIX. THE TEACHINGS OF ANAXAGORAS.      As Pericles was a very cultivated man, he liked to meet and talk with  the philosophers, and to befriend the artists. He was greatly attached  to the sculptor Phidias, and he therefore did all in his power to save  him from the envy of his fellow-citizens.    An-ax-ag'o-ras, a philosopher of great renown, was the friend and  teacher of Pericles. He, too, won the dislike of the people; and, as  they could not accuse him also of stealing, they charged him with  publicly teaching that the gods they worshiped were not true gods, and  proposed to put him to death for this crime.    Now, Anaxagoras had never heard of the true God, the God whom we  worship. He had heard only of Zeus, Athene, and the other gods honored  by his people; but he was so wise and so thoughtful that he believed the  world could never have been created by such divinities as those.    He observed all he saw very attentively, and shocked the people greatly  by saying that the sun was not a god driving in a golden chariot, but a  great glowing rock, which, in spite of its seemingly small size, he  thought must be about as large as the Peloponnesus.    Of course, this seems very strange to you. But Anaxagoras lived more  than two thousand years ago, and since then people have constantly been  finding out"]]]
