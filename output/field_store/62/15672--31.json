BLUE and PURPLE ASTERS or STARWORTS    Thistle family    Evolution teaches us that thistles, daisies, sunflowers, asters,  and all the triumphant horde of composites were once very  different flowers from what we see today. Through ages of natural  selection of the fittest among their ancestral types, having  finally arrived at the most successful adaptation of their  various parts to their surroundings in the whole floral kingdom,  they are now overrunning the earth. Doubtless the aster's remote  ancestors were simple green leaves around the vital organs, and  depended upon the wind, as the grasses do - a most extravagant  method - to transfer their pollen. Then some rudimentary flower  changed its outer row of stamens into petals, which gradually  took on color to attract insects and insure a more economical  method of transfer. Gardeners today take advantage of a blossom's  natural tendency to change stamens into petals when they wish to  produce double flowers. As flowers and insects developed side by  side, and there came to be a better and better understanding  between them of each other's requirements, mutual adaptation  followed. The flower that offered the best advertisement, as the  composites do, by its showy rays; that secreted nectar in tubular  flowers where no useless insect could pilfer it; that fastened  its stamens to the inside wall of the tube where they must dust  with pollen the underside of every insect, unwittingly  cross-fertilizing the blossom as he crawled over it; that massed  a great number of these tubular florets together where insects  might readily discover them and feast with the least possible  loss of time - this flower became the winner in life's race.  Small wonder that our June fields are white with daisies and the  autumn landscape is glorified with goldenrod and asters!    Since North America boasts the greater part of the two hundred  and fifty asters named by scientists, and as variations in many  of our common species frequently occur, the tyro need expect no  easy task in identifying every one he meets afield. However, the  following are possible acquaintances to everyone:    In dry, shady places the LARGE or BROAD-LEAVED ASTER (A.  macrophyllus), so called from its three or four conspicuous,  heart-shaped leaves on long petioles, in a clump next the ground,  may be more easily identified by these than by the pale lavender  or violet flower-heads of about sixteen rays each which crown its  reddish angular stem in August and September. The disk turns  reddish brown.    In prairie soil, especially about the edges of woods in western  New York, southward and westward to Texas and Minnesota, the  beautiful SKY-BLUE ASTER (A. azureus) blooms from August till  after frost. Its slender, stiff, rough stem branches above to  display the numerous bright blue flowers, whose ten to twenty  rays measure only about a quarter of an inch in length. The upper  leaves are reduced to small flat bracts; the next are linear; and  the lower ones, which approach a heart shape, are rough on both  sides, and may be five or six inches long.    Much more branched and bushy is the COMMON BLUE, BRANCHING, WOOD,  or HEART-LEAVED ASTER (A. cordifolius), whose generous masses of  small, pale lavender flower-heads look like a mist hanging from  one to five feet above the earth in and about the woods and shady  roadsides from September even to December in favored places.    The WAVY or VARIOUS-LEAVED ASTER or SMALL FLEABANE (A. undulatus)  has a stiff, rough, hairy, widely branching stalk, whose thick,  rough lowest leaves are heart-shaped and set on long foot-stems;  above these, the leaves have shorter stems, dilating where they  clasp the stalk; the upper leaves, lacking stems, are seated on  it, while those of the branches are shaped like tiny awls. The  flowers, which measure less than an inch across, often grow along  one side of an axis as well as in the usual raceme. Eight to  fifteen pale blue to violet rays surround the disks which, yellow  at first, become reddish brown in maturity. We find the plant in  dry soil, blooming in September and October.    By no means tardy, the LATE PURPLE ASTER, so-called, or PURPLE  DAISY (A. patens), begins to display its purplish-blue,  daisy-like flower-heads early in August, and farther north may be  found in dry, exposed places only until October. Rarely the  solitary flowers, that are an inch across or more, are a deep,  rich violet. The twenty to thirty rays which surround the disk,  curling inward to dry, expose the vase-shaped, green, shingled  cups that terminate each little branch. The thick, somewhat  rigid, oblong leaves, tapering at the tip, broaden at the base to  clasp the rough, slender stalk. Range similar to the next  species.    Certainly from Massachusetts, northern New York, and Minnesota  southward to the Gulf of Mexico one may expect to find the NEW  ENGLAND ASTER or STARWORT (A. Novae-Angliae) one of the most  striking and widely distributed of the tribe, in spite of its  local name. It is not unknown in Canada. The branching clusters  of violet or magenta-purple flower-heads, from one to two inches  across - composites containing as many as forty to fifty purple  ray florets around a multitude of perfect five-lobed, tubular,  yellow disk florets in a sticky cup - shine out with royal  splendor above the swamps, moist fields, and roadsides from  August to October. The stout, bristle-hairy stem bears a quantity  of alternate lance-shaped leaves lobed at the base where they  clasp it.    In even wetter ground we find the RED-STALKED, PURPLE-STEMMED, or  EARLY PURPLE ASTER, COCASH, SWANWEED, or MEADOW SCABISH (A.  puniceus) blooming as early as July or as late as November. Its  stout, rigid stem, bristling with rigid hairs, may reach a height  of eight feet to display the branching clusters of pale violet or  lavender flowers. The long, blade-like leaves, usually very rough  above and hairy along the midrib beneath, are seated on the stem.  The lovely SMOOTH or BLUE ASTER (A. laevis), whose sky-blue or  violet flower-heads, about one inch broad, are common through  September and October in dry soil and open woods, has strongly  clasping, oblong, tapering leaves, rough margined, but rarely  with a saw-tooth, toward the top of the stem, while those low  down on it gradually narrow into clasping wings.    In dry, sandy soil, mostly near the coast, from Massachusetts to  Delaware, grows one of the loveliest of all this beautiful clan,  the LOW, SHOWY, or SEASIDE PURPLE ASTER (A. spectabilis). The  stiff, usually unbranched stem does its best in attaining a  height of two feet. Above, the leaves are blade-like or narrowly  oblong, seated on the stem, whereas the tapering, oval basal  leaves are furnished with long footstems, as is customary with  most asters. The handsome, bright, violet-purple flower-heads,  measuring about an inch and a half across, have from fifteen to  thirty rays, or only about half as many as the familiar New  England aster. Season August to November.    The low-growing BOG ASTER (A. nemoralis), not to be confused with  the much taller Red-stalked species often found growing in the  same swamp, and having, like it, flower-heads measuring about an  inch and a half across, has rays that vary from light violet  purple to rose pink. Its oblong to lance-shaped leaves, only two  inches long at best, taper to a point at both ends, and are  seated on the stem. We look for this aster in sandy bogs from New  Jersey northward and westward during August and September.    The STIFF or SAVORY-LEAVED ASTER, SANDPAPER, or PINE STARWORT  (Ionactis linariifolius), now separated from the other asters  into a genus by itself, is a low, branching little plant with no  basal leaves, but some that are very narrow and blade-like,  rigid, entire and one-nerved, ascending the stiff stems. The  leaves along the branches are minute and awl-shaped, like those  on a branch of pine. Only from ten to fifteen violet ray flowers  (pistillate) surround the perfect disk florets. From Quebec to  the Gulf of Mexico, and westward beyond the Mississippi this prim  little shrub grows in tufts on dry or rocky soil, and blooms from  July to October.      ROBIN'S, or POOR ROBIN'S, or ROBERT'S PLANTAIN; BLUE SPRING  DAISY; DAISY-LEAVED FLEABANE    (Erigeron pulchellus; E. bellifolium of Gray)  Thistle family    Flower-heads - Composite, daisy-like, 1 to 1/2 in. across; the  outer circle of about 50 pale bluish-violet ray florets; the disk  florets greenish yellow. Stem: Simple, erect, hairy, juicy,  flexible, from 10 in. to 2 ft. high, producing runners and  offsets from base. Leaves: Spatulate, in a flat tuft about the  root; stem leaves narrow, more acute, seated, or partly clasping.  Preferred Habitat - Moist ground, hills, banks, grassy fields.  Flowering Season - April-June.  Distribution - United States and Canada, east of the Mississippi.    Like an aster blooming long before its season, Robin's plantain  wears a finely cut lavender fringe around a yellow disk of minute  florets; but one of the first, not the last, in the long  procession of composites has appeared when we see gay companies  of these flowers nodding their heads above the grass in the  spring breezes as if they were village gossips.    Doubtless it was the necessity for attracting insects which led  the Robin's plantain and other composites to group a quantity of  minute florets, each one of which was once an independent,  detached blossom, into a common head.

Russia before the war had hidden her aeronautic activities behind  the dreary curtain of miles of steppe and marsh that shut her off  from the watchfulness of Western Europe. Professional aviators,  indeed, had gone thither to make exhibition flights for enormous  purses and had brought back word of huge airplanes in course of  construction and an eager public interest in the subject of flying.  But the secrecy which all the governments so soon to be plunged in  war sought to throw about their production of aircraft was  especially easy for Russia in her isolation. When the storm burst  her air fleet was not less than eight hundred airplanes, and at  least twenty-five dirigibles.    A competent authority estimates that at the outbreak of the war the  various Powers possessed a total of 4980 aircraft of all sorts. This  sounds like a colossal fleet, but by 1917 it was probably multiplied  more than tenfold. Of the increase of aircraft we can judge only by  guesswork. The belligerents keep their output an inviolable secret.  It was known that many factories with a capacity of from thirty to  fifty 'planes a week were working in the chief belligerent lands,  that the United States was shipping aircraft in parts to avoid  violation of neutrality laws before their entrance upon the war, and  that American capital operated factories in Canada whence the  completed craft could be shipped regardless of such laws. How great  was the loss to be offset against this new construction is a subject  on which no authoritative figures are available.    It was estimated early in the war that the life of an airplane in  active service seldom exceeded three weeks. In passing it may be  mentioned that by some misapprehension on the part of the public,  this estimate of the duration of a machine was thought to cover also  the average life of the aviators in service. Happily this was far  from true. The mortality among the machines was not altogether due  to wounds sustained in combat, but largely to general wear and tear,  rough usage, and constant service. The slightest sign of weakness in  a machine led to its instant condemnation and destruction, for if it  should develop in mid-air into a serious fault it might cost the  life of the aviator and even a serious disaster to the army which he  was serving. As the war went on the period of service of a machine  became even briefer, for with the growing demand for faster and more  quickly controllable machines everything was sacrificed to lightness  and speed. The factor of safety which early in the war was six to  eight was reduced to three and a half, and instances were known in  all services of machines simply collapsing and going to pieces under  their own weight without wound or shock.    About the extent to which the belligerent governments developed  their air forces after the outbreak of war there was during the  continuance of that conflict great reticence maintained by all of  them. At the outset there was little employment of the flyers except  on scouting reconnaissance work, or in directing artillery fire. The  raids of Zeppelins upon England, of seaplanes on Kiel and Cuxhaven,  of airplanes on Friedrichshaven, Essen, and Venice came later. It  has been noted by military authorities that, while Germany was  provided at first with the largest aviation force of all the  belligerents, she either underestimated its value at the outset, or  did not know how to employ it, for she blundered into and through  Belgium using her traditional Uhlans for scouts, to the virtual  exclusion of airmen. The effectiveness of the Belgian fight for  delay is ascribed largely to the intelligent and effective use its  strategists made of the few aircraft they possessed.    Wellington was wont to say that the thing he yearned for most in  battle was to \"see the other side of that hill.\"    Napoleon wrote:         Nothing is more contradictory, nothing more bewildering than the       multitude of reports of spies, or of officers sent out to       reconnoitre. Some locate army corps where they have seen only       detachments; others see only detachments where they ought to have       seen army corps.    [Illustration: (C) U. & U.    _The Lafayette Escadrille--First Americans to Fly in France._  (_Lufbery on left, Thaw on right._)]    So the two great protagonists of the opening years of the  nineteenth century deplored their military blindness. In the opening  years of the twentieth it was healed. All that Wellington strove to  see, all that the cavalry failed to find for Napoleon is to-day  brought to headquarters by airmen, neatly set forth in maps,  supported by photographs of the enemy's positions taken from the  sky.    Before describing the exploits of the airmen in actual campaign let  us consider some account of how they were trained for their arduous  and novel duties.    To the non-professional an amazing thing about the employment of  aircraft in war has been the rapidity with which pilots are trained.  The average layman would think that to learn the art of manoeuvring  an airplane with such swiftness as to evade the attacks of an enemy,  and to detect precisely the proper moment and method of attacking  him in turn, would require long and arduous practice in the air. But  as we have seen in earlier chapters, inventors like the Wrights,  Bleriot, and Farman learned to fly with but a few hours spent in the  air, with flights lasting less than ten minutes each. So too the  army aviators spent but little time aloft, though their course of  instruction covered in all a period of about four months.    Some account of the method of instruction as reported by several out  of the hundred or more American boys who went to fly for France may  be interesting.    As a rule the aviators were from twenty to twenty-five years of age.  \"Below twenty boys are too rash; above twenty-five they are too  prudent,\" said a sententious French aviator. A slight knowledge of  motors such as would be obtained from familiarity with automobiles  was a marked advantage at the start, for the first task of the  novice was to make himself familiar with every type of airplane  engine. The army pilot in all the armies was the aristocrat of the  service. Mechanics kept his motor in shape, and helpers housed,  cleaned, and brought forth his machine for action. But while all but  the actual piloting and fighting was spared him, there was always  the possibility of his making an untimely landing back of the  enemy's lines with an engine that would not work. To prepare for  such an emergency he was taught all the intricacies of motor  construction, so that he might speedily correct any minor fault.    In our army, and indeed in all others, applicants for appointment to  the aviation corps were subjected to scientific tests of their  nerves, and their mental and physical alertness. How they would  react to the sudden explosion of a shell near their ears, how long  it took the candidate to respond to a sudden call for action, how  swiftly he reacted to a sensation of touch were all tested and  measured by delicate electric apparatus. A standard was fixed,  failing to attain which, the applicant was rejected. The practical  effect might be to determine how long after suddenly discovering a  masked machine gun a given candidate would take before taking the  action necessary to avoid its fire. Or how quickly would he pull the  lever necessary to guard against a sudden gust of wind. To the  layman it would appear that problems of this sort could only be  solved in the presence of the actual attack, but science, which  enables artillerists to destroy a little village beyond the hills  which they never see, was able to devise instruments to answer these  questions in the quiet of the laboratory.    One of the best known flying schools of the French army was at Pau,  where on broad level plains were, in 1917, four separate camps for  aviators, each with its group of hangars for the machines, its  repair shops, and with a tall wireless tower upstanding in the  midst for the daily war news from Paris. On these plains the Wright  Brothers had made some of their earliest French flights. A little  red barn which they had made their workshop was still standing there  when war suddenly turned the spot into a flying school often with as  many as five thousand pupils in attendance. \"To-day that little red  barn,\" writes Carroll Dana Winslow, one of the Americans who went to  fly for France, \"stands as a monument to American stupidity, for  when we allowed the Wrights to go abroad to perfect their ideas  instead of aiding them to carry on their work at home we lost a  golden opportunity. Now the United States which gave to the world  the first practical airplane is the least advanced in this  all-important science.\"    Arrived at the school the tyro studies the fundamentals of flying in  the classroom and on the field for two months before he is allowed  to go up--to receive as they express it, his _bapteme de l'air_. He  picks motors to pieces, and puts them together, he learns the  principles of airplane construction, and can discourse on such  topics as the angle of attack of the cellule, the incidence of the  wings, and the carrying power of the tail-plane. More than any other  science aviation has a vocabulary of its own, and a peculiarly  cosmopolitan one drawn from all tongues, but with the French  predominating. America gave the airplane to France, but France has  given the science its terminology.    The maps of the battlefields of this war are the marvels of military  science. Made from the air they show every road and watercourse,  every ditch and gully, every patch of woodland, every farmhouse,  church, or stonewall. Much of the early work of the aviator is in  learning to make such maps, both by sketches and by the employment  of the camera. It is"]]]
