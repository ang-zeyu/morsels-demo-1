Meanwhile he has his tranquil place in the Poet's Corner of Westminster  Abbey. The Abbey must be a pleasant spot to wait in, for the Portland  boy.    Oddly enough, some of the over-sophisticated and under-experienced  people who affect to patronize Longfellow assume toward John Greenleaf  Whittier an air of deference. This attitude would amuse the Quaker poet.  One can almost see his dark eyes twinkle and the grim lips tighten in  that silent laughter in which the old man so much resembled Cooper's  Leather-Stocking. Whittier knew that his friend Longfellow was a better  artist than himself, and he also knew, by intimate experience as a maker  of public opinion, how variable are its judgments. Whittier represents  a stock different from that of the Longfellows, but equally American,  equally thoroughbred: the Essex County Quaker farmer of Massachusetts.  The homestead in which he was born in 1807, at East Haverhill, had been  built by his great-great-grandfather in 1688. Mount Vernon in  Virginia and the Craigie House in Cambridge are newer than this by two  generations. The house has been restored to the precise aspect it had in  Whittier's boyhood: and the garden, lawn, and brook, even the door-stone  and bridle-post and the barn across the road are witnesses to the  fidelity of the descriptions in \"Snow-Bound.\" The neighborhood is still  a lonely one. The youth grew up in seclusion, yet in contact with a few  great ideas, chief among them Liberty. \"My father,\" he said, \"was an  old-fashioned Democrat, and really believed in the Preamble of the  Bill of Rights which reaffirmed the Declaration of Independence.\"  The taciturn father transmitted to his sons a hatred of kingcraft  and priestcraft, the inward moral freedom of the Quaker touched with  humanitarian passion. The spirit of a boyhood in this homestead is  veraciously told in \"The Barefoot Boy,\" \"School-Days,\" \"Snow-Bound,\"  \"Ramoth Hill,\" and \"Telling the Bees.\" It was a chance copy of Burns  that revealed to the farmer lad his own desire and capacity for  verse-writing. When he was nineteen, his sister sent his \"Exile's  Departure\" to William Lloyd Garrison, then twenty, and the editor of  the \"Newburyport Free Press.\" The neighbors liked it, and the tall frail  author was rewarded with a term at the Haverhill Academy, where he paid  his way, in old Essex County fashion, by making shoes.    He had little more formal schooling than this, was too poor to enter  college, but had what he modestly called a \"knack at rhyming,\" and much  facility in prose. He turned to journalism and politics, for which he  possessed a notable instinct. For a while he thought he had \"done with  poetry and literature.\" Then in 1833, at twenty-six, came Garrison's  stirring letter bidding him enlist in the cause of Anti-Slavery. He  obeyed the call, not knowing that this new allegiance to the service of  humanity was to transform him from a facile local verse-writer into  a national poet. It was the ancient miracle of losing one's life and  finding it. For the immediate sacrifice was very real to a youth trained  in quietism and non-resistance, and well aware, as a Whig journalist,  of the ostracism visited upon the active Abolitionists. Whittier  entered the fight with absolute courage and with the shrewdest practical  judgment of weapons and tactics. He forgot himself. He turned aside from  those pleasant fields of New England legend and history to which he was  destined to return after his warfare was accomplished. He had read the  prose of Milton and of Burke. He perceived that negro emancipation in  the United States was only a single and immediate phase of a universal  movement of liberalism. The thought kindled his imagination. He wrote,  at white heat, political and social verse that glowed with humanitarian  passion: lyrics in praise of fellow-workers, salutes to the dead,  campaign songs, hymns, satires against the clergy and the capitalists,  superb sectional poems like \"Massachusetts to Virginia,\" and, more nobly  still, poems embodying what Wordsworth called \"the sensation and image  of country and the human race.\"    Whittier had now \"found himself\" as a poet. It is true that his style  remained diffuse and his ear faulty, but his countrymen, then as now  uncritical of artistic form, overlooked the blemishes of his verse, and  thought only of his vibrant emotion, his scorn of cowardice and evil,  his prophetic exaltation. In 1847 came the first general collection of  his poems, and here were to be found not merely controversial verses,  but spirited \"Songs of Labor,\" pictures of the lovely Merrimac  countryside, legends written in the mood of Hawthorne or Longfellow, and  bright bits of foreign lore and fancy. For though Whittier never went  abroad, his quiet life at Amesbury gave him leisure for varied reading,  and he followed contemporary European politics with the closest  interest. He emerged more and more from the atmosphere of faction and  section, and, though he retained to the last his Quaker creed, he held  its simple tenets in such undogmatic and winning fashion that his hymns  are sung today in all the churches.    When \"The Atlantic Monthly\" was established in 1857, Whittier was fifty.  He took his place among the contributors to the new magazine not as  a controversialist but as a man of letters, with such poems as  \"Tritemius,\" and \"Skipper Ireson's Ride.\" Characteristic productions of  this period are \"My Psalm,\" \"Cobbler Keezar's Vision,\" \"Andrew Rykman's  Prayer,\" \"The Eternal Goodness\"--poems grave, sweet, and tender. But it  was not until the publication of \"Snow-Bound\" in 1866 that Whittier's  work touched its widest popularity. He had never married, and the deaths  of his mother and sister Elizabeth set him brooding, in the desolate  Amesbury house, over memories of his birthplace, six miles away in East  Haverhill. The homestead had gone out of the hands of the Whittiers, and  the poet, nearing sixty, set himself to compose an idyll descriptive of  the vanished past. No artist could have a theme more perfectly adapted  to his mood and to his powers. There are no novel ideas in \"Snow-Bound,\"  nor is there any need of them, but the thousands of annual pilgrims to  the old farmhouse can bear witness to the touching intimacy, the homely  charm, the unerring rightness of feeling with which Whittier's genius  recreated his own lost youth and painted for all time a true New England  hearthside.    Whittier was still to write nearly two hundred more poems, for he lived  to be eighty-five, and he composed until the last. But his creative  period was now over. He rejoiced in the friendly recognition of his work  that came to him from every section of a reunited country. His personal  friends were loyal in their devotion. He followed the intricacies of  American politics with the keen zest of a veteran in that game, for in  his time he had made and unmade governors and senators. \"The greatest  politician I have ever met,\" said James G. Blaine, who had certainly met  many. He had an income from his poems far in excess of his needs,  but retained the absolute simplicity of his earlier habits. When his  publishers first proposed the notable public dinner in honor of his  seventieth birthday he demurred, explaining to a member of his family  that he did not want the bother of \"buying a new pair of pants\"--a petty  anecdote, but somehow refreshing. So the rustic, shrewd, gentle old man  waited for the end. He had known what it means to toil, to fight, to  renounce, to eat his bread in tears, and to see some of his dreams come  true. We have had, and shall have, more accomplished craftsmen in verse,  but we have never bred a more genuine man than Whittier, nor one who had  more kinship with the saints.    A few days before Whittier's death, he wrote an affectionate poem  in celebration of the eighty-third birthday of his old friend of the  Saturday Club, Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes. This was in 1892. The little  Doctor, rather lonely in his latest years, composed some tender obituary  verses at Whittier's passing. He had already performed the same office  for Lowell. He lingered himself until the autumn of 1894, in his  eighty-sixth year--\"The Last Leaf,\" in truth, of New England's richest  springtime.    \"No, my friends,\" he had said in \"The Autocrat of the Breakfast Table,\"  \"I go (always, other things being equal) for the man who inherits  family traditions and the cumulative humanities of at least four or five  generations.\" The Doctor came naturally by his preference for a \"man of  family,\" being one himself. He was a descendant of Anne Bradstreet,  the poetess. \"Dorothy Q.,\" whom he had made the most picturesque of the  Quincys, was his great-grandmother. Wendell Phillips was his cousin. His  father, the Rev. Abiel Holmes, a Yale graduate, was the minister of the  First Church in Cambridge, and it was in its \"gambrel-roofed\" parsonage  that Oliver Wendell was born in 1809.         \"Know old Cambridge? Hope you do--       Born there? Don't say so! I was, too.       Nicest place that was ever seen--       Colleges red and Common green.\"    So he wrote, in scores of passages of filial devotion, concerning the  village of his boyhood and the city of Boston. His best-known prose  sentence is: \"Boston State House is the hub of the Solar System.\" It is  easy to smile, as indeed he did himself, at such fond provinciality,  but the fact remains that our literature as a whole sadly needs this  richness of local atmosphere. A nation of restless immigrants, here  today and \"moved on\" tomorrow, has the fibres of its imagination  uprooted, and its artists in their eager quest of \"local color\" purchase  brilliancy at the cost of thinness of tone, poverty of association.  Philadelphia and Boston, almost alone among the larger American cities,  yield the sense of intimacy, or what the Autocrat would call \"the  cumulative humanities.\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34110"],[0,"Deadfalls and Snares (#20)"],[1,"into a sack.      [Illustration: WRAP WITH WIRE AT JOINTS.]    In conclusion, boys, let me suggest a maxim or two for your guidance:  \"Prime caught and well handled furs always bring top prices.\" \"Take  pride in your catch, no matter how small.\"    While the heading of this chapter is \"From Animal to Market\" it is  well when shipping to request the dealer to grade and send value. If  satisfactory, write to send on check. If not satisfactory, have  dealer return furs.    When shipping furs under these conditions see that no green skins are  sent--only properly cured ones.    While some dealers offer to pay expressage both ways we hardly think  this fair and if no deal is made the dealer should pay the expressage  one way and the shipper the other.    The Hunter-Trader-Trapper, published at Columbus, Ohio, in the  interests of hunters, trappers and dealers in raw furs contains a  great deal of information that will be of value along the line of  shipping furs as well as trapping methods, etc.        CHAPTER XXVIII.    STEEL TRAPS.    This book would not be complete without at least a few pages devoted  to steel traps. While a few steel traps were in use prior to 1850,  yet it has only been since that date that they have come into general  use. During recent years they have become cheaper and trappers in all  parts of America are using them in greater numbers.    Professional trappers in the North, Northwest and Southwest often  have out lines many miles long and use 200 to 350 steel traps of the  various sizes.    Each of the three main sets--land, water and snow are used in various  ways and to describe all of these would require a book.    Steel traps are made in various sizes from No. 0 to No. 6, to meet  the requirements of trappers for the various animals. The best traps  manufactured are the Newhouse made by the well-known trap  manufacturers--Oneida Community, Ltd., Oneida, N. Y. A brief  description of these follows:      [Illustration: Newhouse No. 0 Trap]    Spread of Jaws, 3 1/2 inches. This, the smallest trap made, is used  mostly for catching the gopher, a little animal which is very  troublesome to western farmers, and also rats and other vermin. It  has a sharp grip and will hold larger game, but should not be  overtaxed.      [Illustration: Newhouse No. 1 Trap]    Spread of Jaws, 4 inches. This Trap is used for catching muskrats and  other small animals, and sold in greater numbers than any other size.  Its use is well understood by professional trappers and it is the  most serviceable size for catching skunks, weasels, rats and such  other animals as visit poultry houses and barns.      [Illustration: Newhouse No. 81 Trap]    Spread of Jaws, 4 inches. Occasionally animals free themselves from  traps by gnawing their legs off just below the trap jaws, where the  flesh is numb from pressure. Various forms of traps have been  experimented with to obviate this difficulty. The Webbed Jaws shown  above have proved very successful in this respect.    Noting the cross-section of the jaws, as illustrated at the left, it  is plain the animal can only gnaw off its leg at a point quite a  distance below the meeting edges. The flesh above the point of  amputation and below the jaws will swell and make it impossible to  pull the leg stump out of the trap.    The No. 81 Trap corresponds in size with the regular No. 1 Newhouse.      [Illustration: Newhouse No. 91 Trap]    Spread of Jaws--91, 5 1/4 inches; 91 1/2, 6 1/4 inches. The double  jaws take an easy and firm grip so high up on the muskrat that he can  not twist out. A skunk cannot gnaw out either.    These traps are especially good for muskrat, mink, skunk and raccoon.    All parts of the No. 91 except the jaws are the same size as the  regular No. 1 Newhouse, while the 91 1/2 corresponds to the regular  No. 1 1/2.      [Illustration: Newhouse No. 1 1/2 Trap]    Spread of Jaws, 4 7/8 inches. This size is called the Mink Trap. It  is, however, suitable for catching the woodchuck, skunk, etc.  Professional trappers often use it for catching foxes. It is very  convenient in form and is strong and reliable.      [Illustration: Newhouse No. 2 Trap]    Spread of Jaws, 4 7/8 inches. The No. 2 Trap is called the Fox Trap.  Its spread of jaws is the same as the No. 1 1/2 but having two  springs it is, of course, much stronger.     [Illustration: Newhouse No. 3 Trap]    Spread of Jaws, 5 1/2 inches. This, the Otter Trap, is very powerful.  It will hold almost any game smaller than a bear.      [Illustration: Newhouse No. 4 Trap]    Spread of Jaws, 6 1/2 inches. This is the regular form of Beaver  Trap. It is longer than the No. 3 Trap, and has one inch greater  spread of jaws. It is a favorite with those who trap and hunt for a  living in the Northwest and Canada. It is also extensively used for  trapping the smaller wolves and coyotes in the western stock raising  regions.      [Illustration: Newhouse No. 2 1/2 Trap]    Spread of Jaws, 6 1/2 inches. In some localities the otter grows to  an unusual size, with great proportionate strength, so that the  manufacturers have been led to produce an especially large and strong  pattern. All the parts are heavier than the No. 2 1/2, the spread of  jaws greater and the spring stiffer.      [Illustration: Newhouse No. 3 1/2 Trap]    Spread of Jaws, 5 inches. The above cut represents a Single Spring  Otter Trap. It is used more especially for catching otter on their  \"slides.\" For this purpose a thin, raised plate of steel is adjusted  to the pan so that when the trap is set the plate will be a trifle  higher than the teeth on the jaws. The spring is very powerful, being  the same as used on the No. 4 Newhouse Trap. The raised plate can be  readily detached if desired, making the trap one of general utility.      [Illustration: Newhouse No. 21 1/2 Trap]    Single Spring. Same as No. 2 1/2 but without Teeth or Raised Plate.    No. 31 1/2 NEWHOUSE TRAP.    Single Spring. Same as No. 3 1/2 but without Teeth or Raised Plate.    Spread of Jaws--No. 21 1/2, 5 1/4 inches; No. 31 1/2, 6 1/2 inches.  These Traps are the largest smooth jaw, single spring sizes that are  made. Professional trappers will find these especially valuable when  on a long trapping line, as they are more compact and easier to  secrete than the large double spring traps. The springs are made  extra heavy.    Note.--The 21 1/2 is practically a single spring No. 3 and the 31 1/2  a single spring No. 4.      [Illustration: Newhouse No. 14 Trap]    Spread of Jaws, 6 1/2 inches. This Trap is the same in size as the  No. 4 Beaver, but has heavier and stiffer springs and offset jaws,  which allow the springs to raise higher when the animal's leg is in  the trap, and is furnished with teeth sufficiently close to prevent  the animal from pulling its foot out.      [Illustration: Clutch Detachable Trap]    Clutch Detachable--Trap can be used with or without it.    Spread of Jaws, No. 23, 5 1/2 inches; No. 24, 6 1/4 inches. The  inventor of this attachment claims to have had wonderful success with  it in taking beaver. The trap should be set with the clutch end  farthest from shore. The beaver swims with his fore legs folded back  against his body, and when he feels his breast touch the bank he puts  them down. The position of the trap can be so calculated that he will  put his fore legs in the trap, when the clutch will seize him across  the body and hold him securely.      [Illustration: Newhouse No. 4 1/2 Trap]    In response to a demand for a new model of the Newhouse Trap  especially adapted to catching wolves, the manufacturers have  perfected a trap which is numbered 4 1/2 and is called the \"Newhouse  Wolf Trap.\"    This trap has eight inches spread of jaw, with other parts in  proportion, and is provided with a pronged \"drag,\" a heavy snap and  an extra heavy steel swivel and chain, five feet long, warranted to  hold 2,000 pounds. The trap complete with chain and \"drag\" weighs  about nine pounds.      [Illustration: Newhouse No. 50 Trap]    Spread of Jaws, 9 inches. This trap is intended for catching small  sized bears. In design it is exactly like the standard No. 5 Bear  Trap, only that the parts are all somewhat smaller. Weight, 11 1/4  pounds each.      [Illustration: Newhouse No. 150 Trap]    Spread of Jaws, 9 inches. This trap is identical with No. 5 excepting  that the jaws are offset, making a space five-eighths inch between  them. This allows the springs to come up higher when the bear's foot  is in the trap, and thus secure a better grip. Also there is less  chance of breaking the bones of the foot. Weight, 11 1/4 pounds each.      [Illustration: Newhouse No. 5 Trap]    Spread of Jaws, 11 3/4 inches. This trap weighs nineteen pounds. It  is used for taking the common black bear and is furnished with a very  strong chain.      [Illustration: Newhouse No. 15 Trap]    Spread of Jaws, 11 3/4 inches. To meet the views of certain hunters  whose judgment is respected, the manufacturers designed a style of  jaw for the No. 5 trap, making an offset of 3/4 of an inch, so as to  allow the springs to come up higher when the bear's leg is in the  trap. This gives the spring a better grip. Those wishing this style  should specify \"No. 15.\"      [Illustration: Newhouse No. 6 Trap]    Spread of Jaws, 16 inches. Weight, complete, 42 pounds. This is the  strongest trap made. We have never heard of anything getting out of  it when once caught. It is used to catch lions and tigers, as well as  the great Grizzly Bears of the Rocky Mountains.      [Illustration: Bear Chain Clevis and Bolt]    This cut illustrates Bear Chain Clevis and Bolt, intended as a  substitute for the ring on the end of the trap chain, when desired.    With this clevis a loop can be made around any small log or tree  without the trouble of cutting to fit the ring. The chain is made  five feet long, suitable for any clog, and the prices of bear traps  fitted with it are the same as with"]]]
