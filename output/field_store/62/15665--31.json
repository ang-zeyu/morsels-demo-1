In general it  will be found that there is a saving of one third of the expense, if the  business be properly conducted. Then the wholesome and nutricious  quality of the bread is incomparably superior; there is no addition of  alum, ground potatoes, whiting, or any other ingredient to give weight  or colour to the bread, as is too often the case with baker's bread; but  all is nutricious, sound, and good. But supposing their bread to be  equal in quality, there is still a considerable saving in the course of  a year, especially in a large family; and if household bread be made  instead of fine bread, every bushel of good heavy wheat will produce  nearly fifteen quartern loaves. Besides this, rye, and even a little  barley mixed with the wheat, will make very good bread, and render it  cheaper still. Rye will add a sweetness to the bread, and make it cut  firmer, so as to prevent the waste of crumbs, and is unquestionably an  article of good economy. The addition of potatoes is by no means to be  approved, though so often recommended; any of the grains already  mentioned have in them ten times the nutrition of potatoes, and in the  end will be found to be much cheaper. Making bread with skim milk,  instead of water, where it can be done, is highly advantageous, and will  produce a much better article than can be purchased at a baker's  shop.--On the subject of making bread, little need be said, as every  common maid-servant is or ought to be well acquainted with this  necessary part of household work, or she is good for nothing. To make  good bread however, the flour should be kept four or five weeks before  it is baked. Then put half a bushel of it into a kneading trough, mix  with it between four and five quarts of warm water or skim milk, and a  pint and a half of good yeast, and stir it well together with the hand  till it become tough. Let it rise before the fire, about an hour and a  half, or less if it rise fast; then, before it falls, add four quarts  more of warm water, and half a pound of salt. Work it well, and cover it  with a cloth. Put the fire into the oven; and by the time it is heated,  the dough will be ready. Make the loaves about five pounds each, sweep  out the oven very clean and quick, and put in the bread; shut it up  close, and two hours and a half will bake it. In summer the water should  be milk warm, in winter a little more, and in frosty weather as hot as  the hand will bear, but not scalding, or the whole will be spoiled.  Bread is better baked without tins, which gives to the crust an  unnatural degree of hardness.--Those who are under the necessity of  purchasing baker's bread, for want of other convenience, may detect the  adulteration of alum by macerating a small piece of the crumb of  new-baked bread in cold water, sufficient to dissolve it; and the taste  of the alum, if it has been used, will acquire a sweet astringency. Or a  heated knife may be thrust into a loaf before it has grown cold; and if  it be free from that ingredient, scarcely any alteration will be visible  on the blade; but, in the contrary case, its surface, after being  allowed to cool, will appear slightly covered with an aluminous  incrustation.      BREAD CAKE. To make a common bread cake, separate from the dough, when  making white bread, as much as is sufficient for a quartern loaf, and  knead well into it two ounces of butter, two of Lisbon sugar, and eight  of currants. Warm the butter in a tea-cupful of good milk. By adding  another ounce of butter or sugar, or an egg or two, the cake may be  improved, especially by putting in a tea-cupful of raw cream. It is best  to bake it in a pan, rather than as a loaf, the outside being less hard.      BREAD CHEESECAKES. Slice a penny white loaf as thin as possible, pour  over it a pint of boiling cream, and let it stand two hours. Beat up  eight eggs, half a pound of butter, and a grated nutmeg. Put in half a  pound of currants, well washed and dried, and a spoonful of brandy or  white wine. Bake them in pattipans, or raised crusts.      BREAD PUDDING. Grate some white bread, pour over some boiling milk, and  cover it close. When soaked an hour or two, beat it fine, and mix with  it two or three eggs well beaten. Put it into a bason that will just  hold it, tie a floured cloth over it, and put it into boiling water.  Send it up with melted butter poured over: it may be eaten with salt or  sugar. Prunes, or French plums, make a fine pudding instead of raisins,  either with suet or bread pudding.--Another and richer. Pour half a pint  of scalding milk, on half a pint of bread crumbs, and cover it up for an  hour. Beat up four eggs, and when strained, add to the bread, with a  tea-spoonful of flour, an ounce of butter, two ounces of sugar, half a  pound of currants, an ounce of almonds beaten with orange-flower water,  half an ounce of orange, of lemon, and of citron. Butter a bason that  will exactly hold it, flour the cloth, tie it tight over, and boil the  pudding an hour.      BREAD SAUCE. Boil a large onion quartered, with some black pepper and  milk, till the onion is quite a pap. Pour the milk on white stale-bread  grated, and cover it. In an hour put it into a saucepan, with a good  piece of butter mixed with a little flour: boil the whole up together,  and serve with it.      BREAD SOUP. Boil some pieces of bread crust in a quart of water, with a  small piece of butter. Beat it with a spoon, and keep it boiling till  the bread and water be well mixed: then season it with a little salt.

E _Extracting perforated Cylinder to be placed within_ C.    F _Centre for ditto._    G. G _Coolers, one to pack within the other._]      BREAD AND BUTTER PUDDING. Spread some butter on slices of bread, and lay  them in a dish, with currants between each layer. To make it rich, add  some sliced citron, orange, or lemon. Pour over an unboiled custard  of milk, two or three eggs, a few corns of pimento, and a very little  ratifia, two hours at least before it is to be baked, and lade it over  to soak the bread. A paste round the edge makes all puddings look  better, but it is not necessary.      BREAD AND RICE PUDDING. Boil a quarter of a pound of rice in some milk  till it is quite soft, put it into a bason, and let it stand till the  next day. Soak some sliced bread in cold milk, drain it off, mash it  fine, and mix it with the rice. Beat up two eggs with it, add a little  salt, and boil it an hour.      BREAKFAST CAKES. Take a pound and a half of flour, four ounces of  butter, a spoonful of yeast, and half a pint of warm milk. Rub the  butter into the flour, and mix the eggs, yeast, and milk together. Put  the liquid into the middle of the flour, and let it stand to rise for  two hours. Make it into cakes, let them stand to rise again, and wash  them over with skimmed milk before they are put into the oven.      BREAST OF LAMB. Cut off the chine-bone from the breast, and set it on to  stew with a pint of gravy. When the bones would draw out, put it on the  gridiron to grill; and then lay it in a dish on cucumbers nicely stewed.      BREAST OF MUTTON. Pare off the superfluous fat, and roast and serve the  meat with stewed cucumbers; or to eat cold, covered with chopped  parsley. Or half-boil, and then grill it before the fire: cover it with  bread crumbs and herbs, and serve with caper sauce. Or if boned, take  away a good deal of the fat, and cover it with bread, herbs, and  seasoning. Then roll and boil it; serve with chopped walnuts, or capers  and butter.      BREAST OF VEAL. Before roasting it, take off the two ends to fry and  stew, if the joint be large, or roast the whole together, and pour  butter over it. If any be left, cut it into regular pieces, put them  into a stewpan, and pour some broth over it. If no broth, a little water  will do: add a bunch of herbs, a blade or two of mace, some pepper, and  an anchovy. Stew till the meat be tender, thicken with flour and butter,  and add a little ketchup. Serve the sweetbread whole upon it, which may  either be stewed or parboiled, and then covered with crumbs, herbs,  pepper and salt, and browned in a Dutch oven. The whole breast may be  stewed in the same way, after cutting off the two ends. A boiled breast  of veal, smothered with onion sauce, is also an excellent dish, if not  old nor too fat.      BRENTFORD ROLLS. Mix with two pounds of flour, a little salt, two ounces  of sifted sugar, four ounces of butter, and two eggs beaten with two  spoonfuls of yeast, and about a pint of milk. Knead the dough well, and  set it to rise before the fire. Make twelve rolls, butter tin plates,  and set them before the fire to rise, till they become of a proper size,  and bake them half an hour.      BREWING. The practice of brewing malt liquor is but seldom adopted by  private families in large towns and cities, owing probably to a want of  conveniences for the purpose, and an aversion to the labour and trouble  which it might occasion. But if the disagreeable filthiness attending  the process in large public breweries were duly considered, together  with the generally pernicious quality of the beer offered to sale, as  well as the additional expense incurred by this mode of procuring it, no  one who regards economy, or the health and comfort of his family, would  be without home-brewed beer, so long as there were any means left of  obtaining it. Beer as strong of malt and hops, when all the foreign  ingredients are extracted, may be manufactured at home at less than one  third of what it could cost at a public brewery, besides the  satisfaction of drinking, what is known to be wholesome, and free from  any deleterious mixture.

The stem is two to four inches long, firm, hollow, sometimes smooth,  sometimes powdered with whitish, soft hairy down, in color the same as  the pileus, yielding a dark red juice which gives name to the species.    The color varies quite a little in these plants, owing to some having  more of the red juice than others. The genus is readily identified by  the dull blood-red juice, hollow stem, the crenate margin of the cap,  and its dense cespitose habits. It is found on decayed logs in damp  places from August to October. The plants in Figure 90 were found in  Haynes' Hollow, September 8. The plant is widely distributed over the  United States. No one will have the slightest difficulty in recognizing  this species after seeing the plants in the figure above.      _Mycena alkalina. Fr._    THE STUMP MYCENA.    [Illustration: Figure 91.--Mycena alkalina. Two-thirds natural size,  often larger. Young specimens.]    Solitary or cespitose; pileus one-half to two inches broad, rather  membranaceous, campanulate, obtuse, naked, deeply striate, moist,  shining when dry, when old expanded or depressed, but little changed in  color, though occasionally with a pink or yellow hue, whitish or  grayish, the center of the disk darker.    The gills are adnate, rather distant, slightly ventricose, at first  pale, then glaucous, pinkish, or yellow, more or less connected by  veins.    The stem is smooth, slightly sticky, shining, villous at the base with a  sometimes tawny-down, sometimes firm and tenacious, hollow, attenuated  upward. The plant is rigid, but brittle, and strong-scented. Found on  decayed stumps and logs, you will meet it frequently. August to  November.      _Mycena filopes. Bull._    THREADY-STEMMED MYCENA.    Pileus membranaceous, obtuse, campanulate, then expanded, striate, brown  or umber, tinged with pink.    The gills are free or minutely adnexed, slightly ventricose, white or  paler than the pileus, crowded.    The stem is hollow, juicy, smooth, filiform, rather brittle, whitish or  brownish. Found in woods on leaves, after a rain, from July to October.      _Mycena stannea. Fr._    THE TIN-COLORED MYCENA.    [Illustration: Figure 92.--Mycena stannea. Natural size. Caps white,  sometimes smoky.]    Stannea pertaining to the color of tin. This is a delicate species that  grows in the woods in tufts on rotten wood in damp places. The general  character is shown in the illustration, being nearly white but many of  the pilei are somewhat smoky.    The pileus is firm, membranaceous, bell-shaped, then expanded, smooth,  very slightly striate, hygrophanous, quite silky, tin-color.    The gills are firmly attached to the stem, with a decurrent tooth,  connected by veins, grayish-white.    The stem is smooth, even, shining, becoming pale, at length compressed.  This species differs from Mycena vitrea in having a tooth to the gills.  May, June, and July.      _Mycena vitrea. Fr._    Vitrea, glassy. This plant is quite fragile. The pileus is  membranaceous, bell-shaped, livid-brown, finely striate, no trace of  umbo.    The gills are firmly attached to the stem, not connected by veins,  distinct, linear, whitish.    The stem is slender, slightly striate, polished, pale, base fibrillose.  This species differs from M. aetites and M. stannea in gills not having a  decurrent tooth and not being connected by veins.      _Mycena corticola. Fr._    [Illustration: Figure 93.--Mycena corticola.]    Corticola means dwelling on bark.    It is one of the smallest of the Mycenas, the pileus being about two to  four lines across, thin, hemispherical, obtuse, becoming slightly  umbilicate, deeply striate, glabrous or flocculosely pruinose, gray,  tan, or brownish.    The gills are attached to the stem, with slight decurrent tooth, broad,  rather ovate, pallid.    The stem, is short, slender, incurved, glabrous or minutely scurfy,  somewhat paler than the pileus. The spores are elliptical, 5-6x3u;  cystidia obtusely fusiform, 50-60x8-10u.    These plants are found on the bark of living trees. After rains I have  seen the bark on the shade trees along the walks in Chillicothe,  literally covered with these beautiful little plants. The plants in  Figure 93 were taken from a maple tree the 4th of December. They are  very close allied to M. hiemalis but can be distinguished by the broad,  ovate gills bearing cystidia, and smaller spores.      _Mycena hiemalis. Osbeck._    THE WINTER MYCENA.    Hiemalis, of, or belonging to, winter. The pileus quite thin,  bell-shaped, very slightly umbonate, margin striate; pinkish, rufescent,  white, sometimes pruinose.    The gills are adnate, linear, white or whitish.    The stem is slender, curved, base downy, whitish, pinkish-red. The  spores are 7-8x3.    This is a more delicate species than M. corticola and differs from it in  its narrow gills, and striate, not sulcate, pileus, also in the color of  the stem. Found on stumps and logs. October and November.      _Mycena Leaiana. Berk._    [Illustration: Figure 94.--Mycena leaiana. Natural size. Caps bright  orange and very viscid.]    Leaiana named in honor of Mr. Thomas G. Lea, who was the first man to  study mycology in the Miami Valley. This is a very beautiful plant  growing on decayed beech logs in rainy weather. The pileus is fleshy,  very viscid, bright orange, the margin slightly striate as will be seen  in the one whose cap shows.    The gills are distant, not entire, broad, notched at the stem, attached,  the edge a dusky orange, or vermilion, the short gills beginning at the  margin.    The stem is in most cases curved, attenuated toward the cap, smooth,  hollow, rather firm, quite hirsute or strigose at the base. The spores  are elliptical, apiculate, .0090x.0056 mm.    They are caespitose, growing in dense tufts on logs somewhat decayed. It  is extremely viscid, so much so that your hands will be stained yellow  if you handle it much. It grows from spring to fall but is usually more  abundant in August and September. Very common.      _Mycena iris. B._    Pileus is small, convex, expanded, obtuse, slightly viscid, striate,  quite [blue?] when young, growing brownish with blue fibrils.    The gills are free, tinged with gray.    The stem is short, bluish below, tinged with brown above, somewhat  pruinose. Found in damp woods after a rain, in August.      _Mycena pura. Pers._    [Illustration: _Photo by Prof. G. D. Smith._    Figure 95.--Mycena pura.]    Pura means unstained, pure.    The pileus is fleshy, thin, bell-shaped, expanded, obtusely umbonate,  finely striate on the margin, sometimes having margin upturned, violet  to rose.    The gills are broad, adnate to sinuate, in older plants sometimes free  by breaking away from the stem, connected by veins, sometimes wavy and  crenate on the edge, the edge of the gills sometimes almost or quite  white, violet, rose.    The stem is even, nearly naked, somewhat villous at the base, sometimes  almost white when young, later assuming the color of the cap, hollow,  smooth.    The spores are white and oblong, 6-8x3-3.5. M. Pelianthina differs  from this in having dark-edged gills. It differs from M. pseudopura and  M. zephira in having a strong smell. M. ianthina differs in having a  conical cap.    This plant is quite widely distributed. Our plants are light-violet in  color, and the color seems constant. I have found it in mixed woods. It  is found in September and October.      _Mycena vulgaris. Pers._    Vulgaris means common.    The pileus is small, convex, then depressed, papillate, viscid,  brownish-gray, finely striate on the margin.    The gills are subdecurrent, thin, white; the depressed cap and decurrent  gills make the plant resemble an Omphalia. Spores, 5x2.5u.    The stem is viscid, pale, tough, fibrillose at the base, rooting,  becoming hollow. It differs from M. pelliculosa in not having a  separable cuticule and the fold-like gills.    This plant will be recognized by its smoky or grayish color, umbilicate  pileus, and viscid stem. It is found in woods on leaves and decayed  sticks. August and September.      _Mycena epipterygia. Scop._    [Illustration: Figure 96.--Mycena epipterygia.]    Epipterygia is _Epi_, upon, and _Pterygion_, a small wing.    These are small, the pileus being one-half to one inch broad,  membranaceous, bell-shaped, then expanded, rather obtuse, not depressed,  striate, the cuticule separable in every condition and viscid in damp  weather, gray, often pale yellowish-green near the margin often minutely  notched when young.    The gills are attached to the stem with a decurrent tooth, thin, whitish  or tinged with gray.    The stem is two to four inches long, hollow, tough, rooting, viscid,  yellowish, sometimes gray or even whitish. The spores are elliptical,  8-10x4-5u.    These plants have a wide distribution and [are?] found on branches,  among moss and dead leaves. They are found in clusters and solitary.  They resemble in many ways M. alcalina but do not have the peculiar  smell.    The plants in Figure 96 were photographed by Prof. G. D. Smith of Akron.      _Omphalia. Fr._    Omphalia is from a Greek word meaning the navel; referring here to the  central depression in the cap.    The pileus from the first is centrally depressed, then funnel-shaped,  almost membranaceous, and watery when moist; margin incurved or  straight. Stem cartilaginous and hollow, often stuffed when young,  continuous with the cap but different in character. Gills decurrent and  sometimes branched.    They are generally found on wood, preferring a damp woody situation and  a wet season. It is easily distinguished from Collybia and Mycena by its  decurrent gills. In some of the species of the Mycena where the gills  are slightly decurrent, the pileus is not centrally depressed as it is  in corresponding species of Omphalia. There are a few species of  Omphalia whose pileus is not centrally depressed but whose gills are  plainly decurrent."]]]
