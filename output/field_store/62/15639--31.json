The proceedings were opened with prayer, by the Rev. Mr. Wicher, of  the Free-will Baptist Church. Even at that early day, there were many  of the liberal clergymen in favor of equal rights for women. During  the reading of the minutes of the preliminary meeting by the  Secretary, much uneasiness was manifested concerning the low voices of  women, and cries of \"Louder, louder!\" drowned every other sound, when  the President, on rising, said:         Friends, we present ourselves here before you, as an oppressed       class, with trembling frames and faltering tongues, and we do not       expect to be able to speak so as to be heard by all at first, but       we trust we shall have the sympathy of the audience, and that you       will bear with our weakness now in the infancy of the movement.       Our trust in the omnipotency of right is our only faith that we       shall succeed.    As the appointed Secretaries could not be heard, Sarah Anthony Burtis,  an experienced Quaker school-teacher, whose voice had been well  trained in her profession, volunteered to fill the duties of that  office, and she read the reports and documents of the Convention with  a clear voice and confident manner, to the great satisfaction of her  more timid coadjutors.    Several gentlemen took part in the debates of this Convention. Some in  favor, some opposed, and others willing to make partial concessions to  the demands as set forth in the Declaration and Resolutions. Frederick  Douglass, William C. Nell, and William C. Bloss advocated the  emancipation of women from all the artificial disabilities, imposed by  false customs, creeds, and codes. Milo Codding, Mr. Sulley, Mr.  Pickard, and a Mr. Colton, of Connecticut, thought \"woman's sphere was  home,\" and that she should remain in it; he would seriously deprecate  her occupying the pulpit.    Lucretia Mott replied, that the gentleman from New Haven had objected  to woman occupying the pulpit, and indeed she could scarcely see how  any one educated in New Haven, Ct., could think otherwise than he did.  She said, we had all got our notions too much from the clergy, instead  of the Bible. The Bible, she contended, had none of the prohibitions  in regard to women; and spoke of the \"honorable women not a few,\"  etc., and desired Mr. Colton to read his Bible over again, and see if  there was anything there to prohibit woman from being a religious  teacher. She then complimented the members of that church for opening  their doors to a Woman's Eights Convention, and said that a few years  ago, the Female Moral Reform Society of Philadelphia applied for the  use of a church in that city, in which to hold one of their meetings;  they were only allowed the use of the basement, and on condition that  none of the women should speak at the meeting. Accordingly, a D.D. was  called upon to preside, and another to read the ladies' report of the  Society.    Near the close of the morning session, a young bride in traveling  dress,[10] accompanied by her husband, slowly walked up the aisle, and  asked the privilege of saying a few words, which was readily granted.  Being introduced to the audience, she said, on her way westward,  hearing of the Convention, she had waited over a train, to add her  mite in favor of the demand now made, by the true women of this  generation:         It is with diffidence that I speak upon this question before us,       not a diffidence resulting from any doubt of the worthiness of       the cause, but from the fear that its depth and power can be but       meagerly portrayed by me.... Woman's rights--her civil       rights--equal with man's--not an equality of moral and religious       influence, for who dares to deny her that?--but an equality in       the exercise of her own powers, and a right to use all the       sources of erudition within the reach of man, to build unto       herself a name for her talents, energy, and integrity. We do not       positively say that our intellect is as capable as man's to       assume, and at once to hold, these rights, or that our hearts are       as willing to enter into his actions; for if we did not believe       it, we would not contend for them, and if men did not believe it,       they would not withhold them with a smothered silence.... In       closing, she said: There will be one effect, perhaps unlooked       for, if we are raised to equal administration with man. It will       classify intellect. The heterogeneous triflings which now, I am       very sorry to say, occupy so much of our time, will be neglected;       fashion's votaries will silently fall off; dishonest exertions       for rank in society will be scorned; extravagance in toilet will       be detested; that meager and worthless pride of station will be       forgotten; the honest earnings of dependents will be paid;       popular demagogues crushed; impostors unpatronized; true genius       sincerely encouraged; and, above all, pawned integrity redeemed!       And why? Because enfranchised woman then will feel the burdens of       her responsibilities, and can strive for elevation, and will       reach all knowledge within her grasp.... If all this is       accomplished, man need not fear pomposity, fickleness, or an       unhealthy enthusiasm at his dear fireside; we can be as dutiful,       submissive, endearing as daughters, wives, and mothers, even if       we hang the wreath of domestic harmony upon the eagle's talons.    Thus for twenty minutes the young and beautiful stranger held her  audience spell-bound with her eloquence, in a voice whose pathos  thrilled every heart. Her husband, hat and cane in hand, remained  standing, leaning against a pillar near the altar, and seemed a most  delighted, nay, reverential listener. It was a scene never to be  forgotten, and one of the most pleasing incidents of the Convention.    Sarah Owen read an address on woman's place and pay in the world of  work. In closing, she said:         An experienced cashier of this city remarked to me that women       might be as good book-keepers as men; but men have monopolized       every lucrative situation, from the dry-goods merchant down to       whitewashing. Who does not feel, as she sees a stout, athletic       man standing behind the counter measuring lace, ribbons, and       tape, that he is monopolizing a woman's place, while thousands of       rich acres in our western world await his coming? This year, a       woman, for the first time, has taken her place in one of our       regular medical colleges. We rejoice to hear that by her dignity       of manner, application to study, and devotion to the several       branches of the profession she has chosen, she has secured the       respect of her professors and class, and reflected lasting honor       upon her whole sex. Thus we hail, in Elizabeth Blackwell, a       pioneer for woman in this profession.         It is by this inverted order of society that woman is obliged to       ply the needle by day and by night, to procure even a scanty       pittance for her dependent family. Let men become producers, as       nature has designed them, and women be educated to fill all those       stations which require less physical strength, and we should soon       modify many of our social evils. I am informed by the       seamstresses of this city, that they get but thirty cents for       making a satin vest, and from twelve to thirty for making pants,       and coats in the same proportion. Man has such a contemptible       idea of woman, that he thinks she can not even sew as well as he       can; and he often goes to a tailor, and pays him double and even       treble for making a suit, when it merely passes through his       hands, after a woman has made every stitch of it so neatly that       he discovers no difference. Who does not see gross injustice in       this inequality of wages and violation of rights? To prove that       woman is capable of prosecuting the mercantile business, we have       a noble example in this city in Mrs. Gifford, who has sustained       herself with credit. She has bravely triumphed over all obloquy       and discouragement attendant on such a novel experiment, and made       for herself an independent living.         In the fields of benevolence, woman has done great and noble       works for the safety and stability of the nation. When man shall       see the wisdom of recognizing a co-worker in her, then may be       looked for the dawning of a perfect day, when woman shall stand       where God designed she should, on an even platform with man       himself.    Mrs. Roberts, who had been requested to investigate the wrongs of the  laboring classes, and to invite that oppressed portion of the  community to attend the Convention, and take part in its  deliberations, made some appropriate remarks relative to the  intolerable servitude and small remuneration paid to the working-class  of women. She reported the average price of labor for seamstresses to  be from 31 to 38 cents a day, and board from $1.25 to $1.50 per week  to be deducted therefrom, and they were generally obliged to take half  or more in due bills, which were payable in goods at certain stores,  thereby obliging them many times to pay extortionate prices.    Mrs. Galloy corroborated the statement, having herself experienced  some of the oppressions of this portion of our citizens, and expressed  her gratitude that the subject was claiming the attention of this  benevolent and intelligent class of community. It did not require much  argument, to reconcile all who took part in the debates, to woman's  right to equal wages for equal work, but the gentlemen seemed more  disturbed as to the effect of equality in the family. With the old  idea of a divinely ordained head, and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28026"],[0,"Great Pianists on Piano Playing (#20)"],[1,"obliterate the emotional side and depend upon artifice or what might be  called in vulgar parlance \"tricks of the trade,\" pianism will inevitably  descend to a vastly lower level. By cultivating a sensibility in touch  and employing the technical means which will bring the interpreter's  message to the world with the least possible obstruction, we reach the  highest in the art. Those who would strain at gnats might contend that  with the machinery of the instrument itself, intervening between the  touch at the keyboard and the sounding wires, would make the influence  of the emotions though the tactile sense (sense of touch) is wholly  negligible. To this I can only reply that the experience of the artist  and the teacher is always more reliable, more susceptible to finer  appreciations of artistic values than that of the pure theorist, who  views his problems through material rather than spiritual eyes. Every  observing pianist is familiar with the remarkable influence upon the  nerves of the voice-making apparatus that any emotion makes. Is it not  reasonable to suppose that the finger tips possess a similar sensibility  and that the interpretations of any highly trained artist are duly  affected through them?      INDIVIDUALITY, CHARACTER AND TEMPERAMENT    \"Indeed, Individuality, Character and Temperament are becoming more and  more significant in the highly organized art of pianoforte playing.  Remove these and the playing of the artist again becomes little better  than that of a piano-playing machine. No machine can ever achieve the  distinguishing charm that this trinity brings to pianoforte playing.  Whether the performer is a 'genius' who has carefully developed the  performance of a masterpiece until it evidences that distinguishing mark  of the authoritative interpretation, or whether he is a 'talent' who  improvises as the mood of the moment inspires him and never plays the  same composition twice in anything like a similar manner, he need not  fear the rivalry of any machine so long as he preserves his  individuality, character and temperament.      GENIUS AND WORK    \"The fault with many students, however, is the very erroneous idea that  genius or talent will take the place of study and work. They minimize  the necessity for a careful painstaking consideration of the infinite  details of technic. To them, the significance of the developments of  Bach, Rameau, and Scarlatti in fingering means nothing. They are content  with the superficial. They are incapable of comparing the value of the  advances made by Von Buelow, Tausig and other innovators whose lives were  given to a large extent to the higher development of the technic of the  instrument. They struggle laboriously at the keyboard, imagining that  they are dealing with the problem of technic, when in reality they are  doing little more than performing a drill in a kind of musical  gymnasium--a necessary drill to be sure, but at the same time quite  worthless unless directed by a brain trained in the principles of the  technic of the art.

[Illustration: KATHARINE GOODSON]    KATHARINE GOODSON    BIOGRAPHICAL      Miss Katharine Goodson was born at Watford, Herts, England. She  commenced the study of music at so very youthful an age that she made  several appearances in the English Provinces before she was twelve years  of age. Her talent aroused such interest that she was sent to the Royal  Academy of Music in London. There she was placed under the artistic  guidance of one of the foremost English teachers of pianoforte, Oscar  Beringer, with whom she remained for six years. This was followed by  four years under Leschetizky in Vienna.    Leschetizky saw splendid opportunities in such talented and regularly  trained material and is said to have given particularly careful  attention to Miss Goodson. It is not surprising that upon her return to  London Miss Goodson made a profound impression upon the musical public  and laid the foundation for a splendid reputation. She toured in  England, Germany, Austria and America with great success. In the Grove  Dictionary, her playing is described in the following manner: \"It is  marked by an amount of verve and animation that are most rare with the  younger English pianists. She has a great command of tone gradation,  admirable technical finish, genuine musical taste and considerable  individuality of style.\" In 1903 Miss Goodson married Mr. Arthur Hinton,  one of the most brilliant of modern English composers.          XI    ANALYZING MASTERPIECES    KATHARINE GOODSON      THE NATURAL TENDENCY TO ANALYZE    \"Judging from the mischievous investigations of things in general, which  seem so natural for the small boy to make, it would appear that our  tendency to analyze things is innate. We also have innumerable  opportunities to observe how children, to say nothing of primitive  people, struggle to construct--to put this and that together for the  purpose of making something new--in other words, to employ the opposite  process to analysis, known as synthesis. Moreover, it does not demand  much philosophy to perceive that all scientific and artistic progress is  based upon these very processes of analysis and synthesis. We pull  things apart to find out how they are made and what they are made of. We  put them together again to indicate the mastery of our knowledge.    \"The measure of musicianship is the ability to do. All the analyzing in  the world will not benefit the pupil unless he can give some visible  indications of his proficiency. Indeed, important as the process is, it  is possible to carry it to extremes and neglect the building process  which leads to real accomplishment.      THE FIRST STEP IN ANALYZING A NEW PIECE    \"A great many of the pupils who have come to me indicate a lamentable  neglect in an understanding of the very first things which should have  been analyzed by the preparatory teachers. It is an expensive process to  study with a public artist unless the preparation has been thoroughly  made. Reputation naturally places a higher monetary value upon the  services of the virtuoso, and for the student to expect instruction in  elementary points in analysis is obviously an extravagance. The  virtuoso's time during the lesson period should be spent in the finer  study of interpretation--not in those subjects which the elementary  teacher should have completed. Often the teacher of an advanced pupil is  deceived at the start and assumes that the pupil has a knowledge, which  future investigations reveal that he does not possess.    \"For instance, the pupil should be able to determine the general  structure of a piece he is undertaking and should be so familiar with  the structure that it becomes a form of second nature to him. If the  piece is a sonata he should be able to identify the main theme and the  secondary theme whenever they appear or whenever any part of them  appears. Inability to do this indicates the most superficial kind of  study.    \"The student should know enough of the subject of form in general to  recognize the periods into which the piece is divided. Without this  knowledge how could he possibly expect to study with understanding?  Even though he has passed the stage when it is necessary for him to mark  off the periods, he should not study a new piece without observing the  outlines--the architectural plans the composer laid down in constructing  the piece. It is one thing for a Sir Christopher Wren to make the plans  of a great cathedral like St. Paul's and quite another thing for him to  get master builders to carry out those plans. By studying the composer's  architectural plan carefully the student will find that he is saving an  immense amount of time. For example, let us consider the Chopin _F Minor  Fantasie_. In this composition the main theme comes three times, each  time in a different key. Once learned in one key, it should be very  familiar in the next key.    \"The student should also know something of the history of the dance, and  he should be familiar with the characteristics of the different national  dances. Each national dance form has something more than a rhythm--it  has an atmosphere. The word atmosphere may be a little loose in its  application here, but there seems to be no other word to describe what I  mean. The flavor of the Spanish bolero is very different from the  Hungarian czardas, and who could confound the intoxicating swirl of the  Italian tarantella with the stately air of cluny lace and silver rapiers  which seems to surround the minuet? The minuet, by the way, is  frequently played too fast. The minuet from Beethoven's Eighth Symphony  is a notable example. Many conductors have made the error of rushing  through it. Dr. Hans Richter conducts it with the proper tempo. This  subject in itself takes a tremendous amount of consideration and the  student should never postpone this first step in the analysis of the  works he is to perform.      THE POETIC IDEA OF THE PIECE    \"Despite the popular impression that music is imitative in the sense of  being able to reproduce different pictures and different emotions, it is"]]]
