It is  interesting to note that in the abandonment of villages the same law  appears to have prevailed here as in the other Tusayan mesas, for in  the shrinkage of the Hopi people they concentrated more and more to  the points of the mesas. Thus, at East Mesa, Sikyatki, Kachinba, and  Kuekuechomo were destroyed, while Walpi remained. At Middle Mesa,  Chukubi and Payuepki became ruins, and in Antelope valley Awatobi was  the last of the Jeditoh series to fall. There has thus been a gradual  tendency to drift from readily accessible locations to the most  impregnable sites, which indicates how severely the Hopi must have  been harassed by their foes. It is significant that some of the oldest  pueblos were originally built in the most exposed positions, and it  may rightly be conjectured that the pressure on the villagers came  long after these sites were chosen. The ancient or original Hopi had a  sense of security when they built their first houses, and they,  therefore, did not find it necessary to seek the protection of cliffs.  Many of them lived in the valley of the Colorado Chiquito, others at  Kishuba. As time went on, however, they were forced, as were their  kindred in other pueblos, to move to inaccessible mesas guarded by  vertical cliffs.    Of the several ruins of Antelope valley, that on the mesa above  Jeditoh or Antelope spring is one of the largest and most interesting.  Stephen calls this ruin Mishiptonga, and a plan of the old house is  given by Mindeleff.    The spring called Kawaika, situated near the former village of the  same name, was evidently much used by the ancient accolents of  Antelope valley. From this neighborhood there was excavated a few  years ago a beautiful collection of ancient mortuary pottery objects,  which was purchased by Mrs Mary Hemenway, of Boston, and is now in the  Peabody Museum at Cambridge. These objects have never been adequately  described, although a good illustration of some of the specimens, with  a brief reference thereto, was published by James Mooney[47] a few  years ago.    Among the most striking objects in this collection are clay models of  houses, dishes, and small vases with rims pierced with holes, and  rectangular vessels ornamented with pictures of birds. There are  specimens of cream, yellow, red, and white pottery in the collection  which, judging by the small size of most of the specimens, was  apparently votive in character.    The ruins called by Stephen \"Horn-house\" and \"Bat-house,\" as well as  the smaller ruin between them, have been described by Mindeleff, who  has likewise published plans of the first two. From their general  appearance I should judge they were not occupied for so long a time as  Awatobi, and by a population considerably smaller. If all these  Jeditoh pueblos were built by peoples from the Rio Grande, it is  possible that those around Jeditoh spring were the first founded and  that Awatobi was of later construction; but from the data at hand the  relative age of the ruins of this part of Tusayan can not be  determined.    There are many ruins situated on the periphery of Tusayan which are  connected traditionally with the Hopi, but are not here mentioned. Of  these, the so-called \"Fire-house\" is said to have been the home of  the ancestors of Sikyatki, and Kintiel of certain Zuni people akin to  the Hopi. Both of the ruins mentioned differ in their architectural  features from characteristic prehistoric Tusayan ruins, for they are  circular in form, as are many of the ruins in the middle zone of the  pueblo area. With these exceptions there are no circular ruins within  the area over which the Hopi lay claim, and it is probable that the  accolents of Kintiel were more Zuni than Hopi in kinship.    Many ruins north of Oraibi and in the neighborhood of the farming  village of Moenkopi are attributed to the Hopi by their traditionists.  The ruins about Kishyuba, connected with the Kachina people, also  belong to Tusayan. These and many others doubtless offer most  important contributions to an exact knowledge of the prehistoric  migrations of this most interesting people.    Among the many Tusayan ruins which offer good facilities for  archeological work, the two which I chose for that purpose are Awatobi  and Sikyatki. My reasons for this choice may briefly be stated.    Awatobi is a historic pueblo of the Hopi, which was more or less under  Spanish influence between the years 1540 and 1700. When properly  investigated, in the light of archeology, it ought to present a good  picture of Tusayan life before the beginning of the modifications  which appear in the modern villages of that isolated province. While I  expected to find evidences of Spanish occupancy, I also sought facts  bearing on the character of Tusayan life in the seventeenth century.    Sikyatki, however, showed us the character of Tusayan life in the  fifteenth century, or the unmodified aboriginal pueblo culture of this  section of the Southwest. Here we expected to find Hopi culture  unmodified by Spanish influence.    The three pueblos of Sikyatki, Awatobi, and Walpi, when properly  studied, will show the condition of pueblo culture in three  centuries--in Sikyatki, pure, unmodified pueblo culture; in Awatobi,  pueblo life as slightly modified by the Spaniards, and in Walpi, those  changes resulting from the advent of Americans superadded. While  special attention has thus far been given by ethnologists mainly to  the last-mentioned pueblo, a study of the ruins of the other two  villages is of great value in showing how the modern life developed  and what part of it is due to foreign influence.    A knowledge of the inner life of the inhabitants of Tusayan as it  exists today is a necessary prerequisite to the interpretation of the  ancient culture of that province; but we must always bear in mind the  evolution of society and the influences of foreign origin which have  been exerted on it. Many, possibly the majority, of modern customs at  Walpi are inherited, but others are incorporated and still others, of  ancient date, have become extinct.    As much stress is laid in this memoir on the claim that objects from  Sikyatki indicate a culture uninfluenced by the Spaniards, it is well  to present the evidence on which this assertion is based.    (1) Hopi legends all declare that Sikyatki was destroyed before the  Spaniards, called the \"long-gowned\" and \"iron-shirted\" men, came to  Tusayan. (2) Sikyatki is not mentioned by name in any documentary  account of Tusayan, although the other villages are named and are  readily identifiable with existing pueblos. (3) No fragment of glass,  metal, or other object indicative of the contact of European  civilization was found anywhere in the ruin. If we add to the above  the general appearance of age in the mounds and the depth of the  debris which has accumulated in the rooms and over the graves, we have  the main facts on which I have relied to support my belief that  Sikyatki is a prehistoric ruin.      AWATOBI    CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RUIN    No Tusayan ruin offers to the archeologist a better picture of the  character of Hopi village life in the seventeenth century than that  known as Awatobi (plate CVII).[48] It is peculiarly interesting as  connecting the prehistoric culture of Sikyatki and modern Tusayan  life, with which we have become well acquainted through recent  research. Awatobi was one of the largest Tusayan pueblos in the middle  of the sixteenth century, and continued to exist to the close of the  seventeenth. It was therefore a historic pueblo. It had a mission,  notices of which occur in historical documents of the period. From its  preponderance in size, no less than from its position, we may suspect  that it held relatively the same leadership among the other Antelope  valley ruins that Walpi does today to Sichomovi and Hano.    The present condition of the ruins of Awatobi is in no respect  peculiar or different from that of the remains of prehistoric  structures, except that its mounds occupy a position on a mesa top  commanding a wide outlook over a valley. On its east it is hemmed in  by extensive sand dunes, which also stretch to the north and west,  receding from the village all the way from a few hundred yards to a  quarter of a mile. On the south the ruins overlook the plain, and the  sands on the west separate it from a canyon in which there are several  springs, some cornfields, and one or two modern Hopi houses. There is  no water in the valley which stretches away from the mesa on which  Awatobi is situated, and the foothills are only sparingly clothed with  desert vegetation. The mounds of the ruin have numerous clumps of  _sibibi_ (_Rhus trilobata_), and are a favorite resort of Hopi women  for the berries of this highly prized shrub. There is a solitary tree  midway between the sand dunes west of the village and the western  mounds, near which we found it convenient to camp. The only  inhabitants of the Awatobi mesa are a Navaho family, who have  appropriated, for the shade it affords, a dwarf cedar east of the old  mission walls. No land is cultivated, save that in the canyons above  mentioned, west of the sand hills; some fair harvests are, however,  still gathered from Antelope valley by the Navaho, especially in the  section higher up, near Jeditoh spring.    The ruin may be approached from the road between Holbrook and Keam's  Canyon, turning to the left after climbing the mesa. This road,  however, is not usually traveled, since it trends through the  difficult sand hills. As Keam's Canyon is the only place in this  region at which to provision an expedition, it is usual to approach  Awatobi from that side, the road turning to the right shortly after  one ascends the steep hill out of the canyon near Keam's trading post.    My archeological work at Awatobi began on July 6, 1895, and was  continued for two weeks, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23692"],[0,"South Africa and the Transvaal War, Vol. 1 (of 8) (#20)"],[1,"speeches delivered by Mr. Gladstone in the south of  Scotland, during the months of November and December 1879, were  putting a new complexion on affairs. They were reprinted all the  world over, and they were profusely circulated among the Boers. The  Boer leaders and obstructionists at once saw in this British  statesman their saviour, and were convinced that, on the return of  Mr. Gladstone to power, their independence would be assured. They  therefore sent Messrs. Kruger and Joubert as a deputation to the  Cape, and these two gentlemen persuaded the Cape Parliament to  reject the Confederation Scheme then being proposed by Sir Bartle  Frere. Selections from the attacks on the Government, from which the  Boers then derived their encouragement and support, are here  reprinted in order that the sincerity of Mr. Gladstone's attitude  may be examined.    Speaking in Edinburgh, he said of the Government:--    \"They have annexed in Africa the Transvaal territory, inhabited by a  free European, Christian, Republican community, which they have  thought proper to bring within the limits of a Monarchy, although  out of 8000 persons in that Republic qualified to vote upon the  subject, we are told--and I have never seen the statement officially  contradicted--that 6500 protested against it. These are the  circumstances under which we undertake to transform Republicans into  subjects of a Monarchy.\"    Now, Sir T. Shepstone's despatches show that the ground on which the  Transvaal was annexed was because the State was drifting into  anarchy, was bankrupt, and was about to be destroyed by native  tribes. He said \"that most thinking men in the country saw no other  way out of the difficulty,\" and Carlyle has taught us what is the  proportion between thinking men and the general public. He also  said, in the fifteenth paragraph of his despatch to Lord Carnarvon  of the 6th of March 1877, that petitions signed by 2500 people,  representing every class of the community, out of a total adult male  population of 8000, had been presented to the Government of the  Republic, setting forth its difficulties and dangers, and praying it  \"to treat with me for their amelioration or removal.\" He likewise  stated, and with perfect truth, that many more would have signed had  it not been for the terrorism that was exercised, and that all the  towns and villages in the country desired the change.    Mr. Gladstone went on to say:--    \"We have made war on the Zulus. We have thereby become responsible  for their territory; and not only this, but we are now, as it  appears from the latest advices, about to make war upon a chief  lying to the northward of the Zulus; and Sir Bartle Frere, who was  the great authority for the proceedings of the Government in  Afghanistan, has announced in South Africa that it will be necessary  for us to extend our dominions until we reach the Portuguese  frontier to the north. So much for Africa.\"    At Dalkeith he remarked:--    \"If we cast our eyes to South Africa, what do we behold? That a  nation whom we term savages have, in defence of their own land,  offered their naked bodies to the terribly improved artillery and  arms of modern European science, and have been mowed down by  hundreds and by thousands, having committed no offence, but having,  with rude and ignorant courage, done what were for them, and done  faithfully and bravely what were for them the duties of patriotism.  You may talk of glory, you may offer rewards,--and you are right to  give rewards to the gallantry of your soldiers, who I think are  entitled not only to our admiration for courage, but to our  compassion for the nature of the duties they have been called to  perform--but the grief and pain none the less remain.\"    At Glasgow he continued in the same strain:--    \"In Africa you have before you the memory of bloodshed, of military  disaster, the record of 10,000 Zulus--such is the computation of  Bishop Colenso--slain for no other offence than their attempt to  defend against your artillery, with their naked bodies, their  hearths and homes, their wives and families. You have the invasion  of a free people in the Transvaal, and you have, I fear, in one  quarter or another--I will not enter into details, which might be  injurious to the public interest--prospects of further disturbance  and shedding of blood.\"    These speeches, as may be imagined, did an incalculable amount of  mischief. Besides fanning the smouldering sparks of discontent, they  served up catchwords wholesale for that section of the British  public whose political machinery is largely fed by catchwords. But,  as has been decided by axiom, \"any stick will serve to beat a dog  with,\" and the Transvaal difficulty was a convenient weapon for the  attack on the Government. The real feeling of the Boer community was  an outside matter, and, as we shall presently see, had nothing to do  with the case, though in March 1880 Mr. Gladstone had the  satisfaction of receiving a letter from a committee of Boer  malcontents, wherein \"he was thanked for the great sympathy shown in  their fate.\" The thanks were a little premature. In April 1880 the  elections took place, and Mr. Gladstone came into power with a  large majority. Then he was asked the great question: Would he  maintain his oft-repeated pledge to retain the Transvaal, or would  he continue to take up the tone of his Midlothian denunciations?    The riddle was shortly to be solved. In the debate on the Queen's  Speech the Prime Minister thus expressed himself: \"I do not know  whether there is an absolute union of opinion on this side of the  House as to the policy in which the assumption of the Transvaal  originated. Undoubtedly, as far as I am myself concerned, I did not  approve of that assumption. I took no part in questioning it nor in  the attempt to condemn it, because, in my opinion, whether the  assumption was wise or unwise, it having been done, no good but only  mischief was to be done by the intervention of this House. But  whatever our original opinions were on that policy--and the opinions  of the majority of those who sit on this side of the House were  decidedly adverse to it--we had to confront a state of facts; and  the main fact which met us was the existence of the large native  population in the Transvaal, to whom, by the establishment of the  Queen's supremacy, we hold ourselves to have given a pledge. That is  the acceptance of facts, and that is the sense in which my right  honourable friend, and all those who sit with him, may, if they  think fit, say we accept the principles on which the late Government  proceeded. It is quite possible to accept the consequences of a  policy, and yet to retain the original difference of opinion with  regard to the character of that policy as long as it was a matter of  discussion.\"    And shortly after he wrote to Messrs. Kruger and Joubert:--    \"It is undoubtedly matter for much regret that it should, since the  annexation, have appeared that so large a number of the population  of Dutch origin in the Transvaal are opposed to the annexation of  that territory, but it is impossible to consider that question as if  it were presented for the first time. We have to deal with a state  of things which has existed for a considerable period, during which  obligations have been contracted, especially, though not  exclusively, towards the native population, which cannot be set  aside.    \"Looking to all the circumstances, both of the Transvaal and the  rest of South Africa, and to the necessity of preventing a renewal  of disorders, which might lead to disastrous consequences, not only  to the Transvaal, but to the whole of South Africa, our judgment is,  that the Queen cannot be advised to relinquish her sovereignty over  the Transvaal, but, consistently with the maintenance of that  sovereignty, we desire that the white inhabitants of the Transvaal  should, without prejudice to the rest of the population, enjoy the  fullest liberty to manage their local affairs. We believe that this  liberty may be most easily and promptly conceded to the Transvaal as  a member of a South African Confederation.\"      THE COMMENCEMENT OF REBELLION    When the Liberal Ministry came into power, it will be observed, Mr.  Gladstone's attitude changed, and that he was compelled to abandon  the sympathetic tone of his Midlothian speeches. How far he really  meant to be bound by the promise made that \"the Queen cannot be  advised to relinquish her sovereignty over the Transvaal\" is not  known, for later on, in June 1881, in a letter to the Transvaal  loyalists, he explains that there was \"no mention of the terms or  date of this promise. If the reference be to my letter of the 8th of  June 1880 to Messrs. Kruger and Joubert, I do not think the language  of that letter justifies the description given. Nor am I sure in  what manner, or to what degree, the fullest liberty to manage their  local affairs, which I then said her Majesty's Government desired to  confer on the white population of the Transvaal, differs from the  settlement now about being made in its bearing on the interests of  those whom your committee represents.\"    This letter was a masterpiece of one whose talent for ambiguity was  becoming world famous, and a stone in shape of a loaf was thus  hurled at the heads of the expectant loyalists.    But to return to the events of 1880. Finding that the Premier was no  longer to be the mainstay of their hopes, the Boers began to renew their  agitations. These agitations, it will be remembered, during the end of  the Zulu war and Sir Garnet Wolseley's arrival in the Transvaal, were  merely suppressed, because at that time British ascendency throughout  the country seemed to be established. An excellent opportunity for  rebellion now suggested itself. The Cape Government was engaged with the  Basuto war. Sir Owen Lanyon, who succeeded Sir T. Shepstone in March  1879,"]]]
