Lincoln even went to Louisville to visit the  Speeds, hoping that the change of scene and friendly sympathies and  counsel would revive his health and spirits.    In one of his letters Lincoln bemoaned his sad fate and referred to \"the  fatal 1st of January,\" probably the date when his engagement or \"the  understanding\" with Mary Todd was broken. From this expression, one of  Lincoln's biographers elaborated a damaging fiction, stating that  Lincoln and his affianced were to have been married that day, that the  wedding supper was ready, that the bride was all dressed for the  ceremony, the guests assembled--but the melancholy bridegroom failed to  come to his own wedding!    If such a thing had happened in a little town like Springfield in those  days, the guests would have told of it, and everybody would have  gossiped about it. It would have been a nine days' wonder, and such a  great joker as Lincoln would \"never have heard the last of it.\"      THE STRANGE EVENTS LEADING UP TO LINCOLN'S MARRIAGE    After Lincoln's return from visiting the Speeds in Louisville, he threw  himself into politics again, not, however, in his own behalf. He  declined to be a candidate again for the State Legislature, in which he  had served four consecutive terms, covering a period of eight years. He  engaged enthusiastically in the \"Log Cabin\" campaign of 1840, when the  country went for \"Tippecanoe and Tyler, too,\" which means that General  William Henry Harrison, the hero of the battle of Tippecanoe, and John  Tyler were elected President and Vice-President of the United States.    In 1842 the young lawyer had so far recovered from bodily illness and  mental unhappiness as to write more cheerful letters to his friend Speed  of which two short extracts follow:    \"It seems to me that I should have been entirely happy but for the  never-absent idea that there is one (Miss Todd) still unhappy whom I  have contributed to make so. That still kills my soul. I cannot but  reproach myself for even wishing to be happy while she is otherwise. She  accompanied a large party on the railroad cars to Jacksonville last  Monday, and at her return spoke, so I heard of it, of having 'enjoyed  the trip exceedingly.' God be praised for that.\"           *       *       *       *       *    \"You will see by the last _Sangamon Journal_ that I made a temperance  speech on the 22d of February, which I claim that Fanny and you shall  read as an act of charity toward me; for I cannot learn that anybody has  read it or is likely to. Fortunately it is not long, and I shall deem it  a sufficient compliance with my request if one of you listens while the  other reads it.\"    Early the following summer Lincoln wrote for the _Sangamon Journal_ a  humorous criticism of State Auditor Shields, a vain and \"touchy\" little  man. This was in the form of a story and signed by \"Rebecca of the Lost  Townships.\" The article created considerable amusement and might have  passed unnoticed by the conceited little auditor if it had not been  followed by another, less humorous, but more personal and satirical,  signed in the same way, but the second communication was written by two  mischievous (if not malicious) girls--Mary Todd and her friend, Julia  Jayne. This stinging attack made Shields wild with rage, and he demanded  the name of the writer of it. Lincoln told the editor to give Shields  _his_ name as if he had written both contributions and thus protect the  two young ladies. The auditor then challenged the lawyer to fight a  duel. Lincoln, averse to dueling, chose absurd weapons, imposed  ridiculous conditions and tried to treat the whole affair as a huge  joke. When the two came face to face, explanations became possible and  the ludicrous duel was avoided. Lincoln's conduct throughout this  humiliating affair plainly showed that, while Shields would gladly have  killed _him_, he had no intention of injuring the man who had challenged  him.    Mary Todd's heart seems to have softened toward the young man who was  willing to risk his life for her sake, and the pair, after a long and  miserable misunderstanding on both sides, were happily married on the  4th of November, 1842. Their wedding ceremony was the first ever  performed in Springfield by the use of the Episcopal ritual.    When one of the guests, bluff old Judge Tom Brown, saw the bridegroom  placing the ring on Miss Todd's finger, and repeating after the  minister, \"With this ring\"--\"I thee wed\"--\"and with all\"--\"my worldly  goods\"--\"I thee endow\"--he exclaimed, in a stage whisper:    \"Grace to Goshen, Lincoln, the statute fixes all that!\"    In a letter to Speed, not long after this event, the happy bridegroom  wrote:    \"We are not keeping house but boarding at the Globe Tavern, which is  very well kept now by a widow lady of the name of Beck. Our rooms are  the same Dr. Wallace occupied there, and boarding only costs four  dollars a week (for the two). I most heartily wish you and your family  will not fail to come. Just let us know the time, a week in advance, and  we will have a room prepared for you and we'll all be merry together for  a while.\"          CHAPTER XV    LINCOLN & HERNDON      YOUNG HERNDON'S STRANGE FASCINATION FOR LINCOLN    Lincoln remained in the office with Judge Logan about four years,  dissolving partnership in 1845. Meanwhile he was interesting himself in  behalf of young William H. Herndon, who, after Speed's removal to  Kentucky, had gone to college at Jacksonville, Ill. The young man seemed  to be made of the right kind of metal, was industrious, and agreeable,  and Mr. Lincoln looked forward to the time when he could have \"Billy\"  with him in a business of his own.    Mrs. Lincoln, with that marvelous instinct which women often possess,  opposed her husband's taking Bill Herndon into partnership. While the  young man was honest and capable enough, he was neither brilliant nor  steady. He contracted the habit of drinking, the bane of Lincoln's  business career. As Mr. Lincoln had not yet paid off \"the national debt\"  largely due to his first business partner's drunkenness, it seems  rather strange that he did not listen to his wife's admonitions. But  young Herndon seems always to have exercised a strange fascination over  his older friend and partner.    While yet in partnership with Judge Logan, Mr. Lincoln went into the  national campaign of 1844, making speeches in Illinois and Indiana for  Henry Clay, to whom he was thoroughly devoted.    Before this campaign Lincoln had written to Mr. Speed:    \"We had a meeting of the Whigs of the county here last Monday to appoint  delegates to a district convention; and Baker beat me, and got the  delegation instructed to go for him. The meeting, in spite of my  attempts to decline it, appointed me one of the delegates, so that in  getting Baker the nomination I shall be fixed like a fellow who is made  a groomsman to a fellow that has cut him out, and is marrying his own  dear 'gal.'\"    Mr. Lincoln, about this time, was offered the nomination for Governor of  Illinois, and declined the honor. Mrs. Lincoln, who had supreme  confidence in her husband's ability, tried to make him more  self-seeking in his political efforts. He visited his old home in  Indiana, making several speeches in that part of the State. It was  fourteen years after he and all the family had removed to Illinois. One  of his speeches was delivered from the door of a harness shop near  Gentryville, and one he made in the \"Old Carter Schoolhouse.\" After this  address he drove home with Mr. Josiah Crawford--\"Old Blue Nose\" for whom  he had \"pulled fodder\" to pay an exorbitant price for Weems's \"Life of  Washington,\" and in whose house his sister and he had lived as hired  girl and hired man. He delighted the old friends by asking about  everybody, and being interested in the \"old swimming-hole,\" Jones's  grocery where he had often argued and \"held forth,\" the saw-pit, the old  mill, the blacksmith shop, whose owner, Mr. Baldwin, had told him some  of his best stories, and where he once started in to learn the  blacksmith's trade. He went around and called on all his former  acquaintances who were still living in the neighborhood. His memories  were so vivid and his emotions so keen that he wrote a long poem about  this, from which the following are three stanzas:            \"My childhood's home I see again             And sadden with the view;           And still, as memory crowds the brain,             There's pleasure in it, too.            \"Ah, Memory! thou midway world             'Twixt earth and paradise,           Where things decayed and loved ones lost             In dreamy shadows rise.            \"And freed from all that's earthy, vile,             Seems hallowed, pure and bright,           Like scenes in some enchanted isle,             All bathed in liquid light.\"      TRYING TO SAVE BILLY FROM A BAD HABIT    As Mr. Lincoln spent so much of his time away from Springfield he felt  that he needed a younger assistant to \"keep office\" and look after his  cases in the different courts. He should not have made \"Billy\" Herndon  an equal partner, but he did so, though the young man had neither the  ability nor experience to earn anything like half the income of the  office. If Herndon had kept sober and done his best he might have made  some return for all that Mr. Lincoln, who treated him like a  foster-father, was trying to do for him. But \"Billy\" did nothing of the  sort. He took advantage of his senior partner's absences by going on  sprees with several dissipated young men about town.      WHAT LAWYER LINCOLN DID WITH A FAT FEE    A Springfield gentleman relates the following story which shows Lawyer  Lincoln's business methods, his unwillingness to charge much for his  legal services; and his great longing to save his young partner from the  clutches of drink:    \"My father,\" said the neighbor, \"was in business, facing the square, not"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22965"],[0,"Ten Thousand Miles with a Dog Sled (#20)"],[1,"1816, should have left the main  peninsula itself unnamed, and that the British expedition which named  Cape Blossom ten years later should have failed to supply the omission.  It still bears no name on the map. We portaged across the Choris  Peninsula and at the end of the portage took a straight course across  the mouth of Escholtz Bay (Escholtz was Kotzebue's surgeon) for Kewalik  on the mainland, passing Chamisso Island, named for Kotzebue's poet  friend. There is something very interesting to me in this voyage of  Kotzebue's, and I have long wished to come across a full narrative of  it. But the bitter wind that swept across that ice-sheet with the  thermometer at -30 deg. brought one's thoughts back to one's own condition.  My hands I could not keep warm with the gear that had sufficed for 50 deg.  and 60 deg. below in the interior, and I was very glad to procure from one  of our native companions a pair of caribou mitts with the hair inside,  an almost invulnerable gauntlet against cold. If that wind had been in  our faces instead of on our sides I am sure we could not have travelled  at all. At last we won across the ice and brought up at a comfortable  road-house at Kewalik, about ten miles from Candle. Here we lay  overnight, taking the opportunity of thawing out and drying the  frost-crusted bedding, leaving the short run into town for the morning.    [Sidenote: CANDLE CREEK]    The diggings on Candle Creek yield to the Koyukuk diggings only as the  most northerly gold mining in the world. Although the general methods  are the same in all Alaskan camps, local circumstances introduce many  differences. In all Alaskan camps the ground is frozen and must be  thawed down. The timber of the interior renders wood the natural fuel  for the production of the steam that thaws the ground, but the scarcity  of wood on the Seward Peninsula substitutes coal. There is coal on the  peninsula itself, but of very inferior quality, mixed with ice. One may  see chunks of coal with veins of ice running through them thrown upon  the fire. The wood of the interior is a great factor in its commercial  and domestic economy, and its absence on the Seward Peninsula makes  great change not only in the natural aspect of the country but in the  whole aspect of its industrial and domestic life also. Wood-chopping for  the stove and the mill, wood-sawing, wood-hauling employ no small  percentage of all the white men in the interior--occupations which do  not exist at all on the peninsula. But its encompassment by the sea, its  peninsularity, is the dominating difference between the Seward Peninsula  and the interior, and does indeed make a different country of it  altogether. All prices are very much lower on the peninsula because  ships can bring merchandise directly from the \"outside.\" Thus amongst  those who have money to spend there is a more lavish scale of living  than in the interior towns, and luxuries may be enjoyed here that are  out of the question there. Perhaps, conversely, it is true that life on  the peninsula is somewhat harder for the poorer class. Whether a railway  from salt water to the mid-Yukon would redress this great difference in  the cost of everything may be doubted. Railways do not usually operate  at less than water-rates. There will probably always be an advantage in  the cost of living and mining in favour of the Seward Peninsula camps.    There had been no public religious service of any sort in Candle, with  its several hundreds of population, in three years, so there was special  satisfaction in having reached the place for Sunday when many miners  were in town from the creeks, and an overflowing congregation was  readily assembled. And there was great pleasure in three days' rest at  the hospitable home of a friend while the temperature remained below  -40 deg., exacerbated by a wind that rendered travelling dangerous.  Moreover, by waiting I had company on the way, and now that I was  without native attendant or white companion, and disposed, if possible,  to make the journey right across the peninsula to Council and then to  Nome without engaging fresh assistance, I was doubly glad of the  opportunity of travelling with two men bound for the same places and  acquainted with the route.    [Sidenote: THE SEWARD PENINSULA]    Travelling, like so many other things, is very different on the Seward  Peninsula. The constant winds beat down and harden the snow until it has  a crust that will carry a man anywhere. There are only two means by  which snow becomes crusted; one is this packing and solidifying by the  wind, and the other is thawing and freezing again. There is much less  wind in the interior than on the coast, and usually much less snowfall,  and the greater part of the surface of the country is protected by  trees; the climate, being continental instead of marine, is not subject  to such great fluctuations of temperature. A thaw sufficiently  pronounced or sufficiently prolonged to put a stout crust on the snow  when freezing is resumed, is a very rare thing in the interior and a  common thing on the coast. So a striking difference in travel at once  manifests itself; in the interior all the snow is soft except on a  beaten trail itself, while in the Seward Peninsula all the snow is alike  hard. The musher is not confined to trails--he can go where he pleases;  and his vehicle is under no necessity of conforming in width to a  general usage of the country--it may be as wide as he pleases. Hence the  hitching of dogs two and three abreast; hence the sleds of twenty-two,  twenty-four, or twenty-six inches in width. My tandem rig aroused the  curiosity of those who saw it. Hence many other differences also.  Hitherto we had not dreamed of watering the dogs since snow fell; now I  found their mouths bloody from their ineffectual attempts to dig up the  hard snow with their teeth, and had to water them night and morning. It  is not the custom on the Seward Peninsula to cook for the dogs, and dog  mushers there argue the needlessness of that trouble. But the true  reason is other and obvious. It is difficult for the traveller to get  enough wood to cook for himself, let alone the dogs. On the Seward  Peninsula skis are extensively used when there is soft snow; the  prevalence of brush almost everywhere in the interior renders them of  little use--and they are, therefore, little used, snow-shoes being  universal.    So, as in nearly all such matters everywhere, local peculiarities, local  differences, local customs, usually arise from local conditions, and the  wise man will commonly conform so soon as he discovers them. There is  almost always a sufficient reason for them.    [Sidenote: A \"SIDLING\" TRAIL]    The journey from Candle to Council was a surprisingly swift one. We  covered the one hundred and thirty miles in three days, far and away the  best travelling of the winter so far, but the usual time, I found. The  hard snow gives smooth passage though the interior of the peninsula is  rugged and mountainous; two prominent elevations, the Ass's Ears,  standing up as landmarks during the first day of the journey. The route  crossed ridge after ridge with steep grades, and the handling of the  heavy sled alone was too much for me. Again and again it was overturned,  and it was all that I could do, and more than I ought to have done, to  set it up again. The wind continued to blow with violence, and shelter  from it there was none. One hillside struggle I shall always remember.  The trail sloped with the hill and the wind was blowing directly down  it. I could keep no footing on the marble snow and had fallen heavily  again and again, in my frantic efforts to hold sled and dogs and all  from sweeping down into a dark ravine that loomed below, when I  bethought me of the \"creepers\" in the hind-sack, used on the rivers in  passing over glare ice. With these irons strapped to my feet I was able  to stand upright, but it was only by a hair's breadth once and again  that I got my load safely across. When I was wallowing in a hot bath at  Council two days later I found that my hip and thigh were black and blue  where I had fallen, though at the time, in my anxiety to save the dogs  and the sled, I had not noticed that I had bruised myself. So, judging  great things by little, one understands how a soldier may be sorely  wounded without knowing it in the heat and exaltation of battle.    Then for a while there would be such travel as one sees in the  children's picture-books, where the man sits in the sled and cracks his  whip and is whisked along as gaily as you please--such travel as I had  never had before; but there was no pleasure in it--the wind saw to  that.    On the second day we crossed \"Death Valley,\" so called because two men  were once found frozen in it; a bleak, barren expanse, five or six miles  across, with a great gale blowing right down it, charged not only with  particles of hard snow but with spicules of ice and grains of sand. Our  course was south and the gale blew from the northwest, and the right  side of one's body and the right arm were continually numb from the  incessant beating of the wind. The parkee hood had to be drawn closely  all the time, and the eyes were sore from trying to peer ahead through  the fur edging of the hood. One grows to hate that wind with something  like a personal animosity, so brutal, so malicious does it seem. An  incautious turn of the head and the scarf that protected mouth and nose  was snatched from me and borne far away in an instant, beyond thought of  recovery. It seems to lie in wait, and one fancies a fresh shrill of  glee in its note at every new discomfiture it can inflict. There is  nothing far-fetched in the native superstition that puts a malignant  spirit in the wind; it is the most natural feeling in the world. I said  so that night in camp, and one of my companions mentioned something  about \"rude Boreas,\" and I laughed. The "]]]
