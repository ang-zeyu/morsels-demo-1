The laws of the  free State, according to the argument, would be displaced, and the act  of Congress, in its effect, be substituted in their place. We do not  see how this conclusion could be avoided, if the construction against  which we are contending should prevail. We are satisfied, however, it  is unsound, and that the true answer to it is, that even conceding,  for the purposes of the argument, that this provision of the act of  Congress is valid within the Territory for which it was enacted, it  can have no operation or effect beyond its limits, or within the  jurisdiction of a State. It can neither displace its laws, nor change  the status or condition of its inhabitants.    Our conclusion, therefore, is, upon this branch of the case, that the  question involved is one depending solely upon the law of Missouri,  and that the Federal court sitting in the State, and trying the case  before us, was bound to follow it.    The remaining question for consideration is, What is the law of the  State of Missouri on this subject? And it would be a sufficient answer  to refer to the judgment of the highest court of the State in the very  case, were it not due to that tribunal to state somewhat at large the  course of decision and the principles involved, on account of some  diversity of opinion in the cases. As we have already stated, this  case was originally brought in the Circuit Court of the State, which  resulted in a judgment for the plaintiff. The case was carried up to  the Supreme Court for revision. That court reversed the judgment  below, and remanded the cause to the circuit, for a new trial. In that  state of the proceeding, a new suit was brought by the plaintiff in  the Circuit Court of the United States, and tried upon the issues and  agreed case before us, and a verdict and judgment for the defendant,  that court following the decision of the Supreme Court of the State.  The judgment of the Supreme Court is reported in the 15 Misso. R., p.  576. The court placed the decision upon the temporary residence of the  master with the slaves in the State and Territory to which they  removed, and their return to the slave State; and upon the principles  of international law, that foreign laws have no extra-territorial  force, except such as the State within which they are sought to be  enforced may see fit to extend to them, upon the doctrine of comity of  nations.    This is the substance of the grounds of the decision.    The same question has been twice before that court since, and the same  judgment given, (15 Misso. R., 595; 17 Ib., 434.) It must be admitted,  therefore, as the settled law of the State, and, according to the  decision in the case of Strader et al. _v._ Graham, is conclusive of  the case in this court.    It is said, however, that the previous cases and course of decision in  the State of Missouri on this subject were different, and that the  courts had held the slave to be free on his return from a temporary  residence in the free State. We do not see, were this to be admitted,  that the circumstance would show that the settled course of decision,  at the time this case was tried in the court below, was not to be  considered the law of the State. Certainly, it must be, unless the  first decision of a principle of law by a State court is to be  permanent and irrevocable. The idea seems to be, that the courts of a  State are not to change their opinions, or, if they do, the first  decision is to be regarded by this court as the law of the State. It  is certain, if this be so, in the case before us, it is an exception  to the rule governing this court in all other cases. But what court  has not changed its opinions? What judge has not changed his?    Waiving, however, this view, and turning to the decisions of the  courts of Missouri, it will be found that there is no discrepancy  between the earlier and the present cases upon this subject. There are  some eight of them reported previous to the decision in the case  before us, which was decided in 1852. The last of the earlier cases  was decided in 1836. In each one of these, with two exceptions, the  master or mistress removed into the free State with the slave, with a  view to a permanent residence--in other words, to make that his or her  domicil. And in several of the cases, this removal and permanent  residence were relied on, as the ground of the decision in favor of  the plaintiff. All these cases, therefore, are not necessarily in  conflict with the decision in the case before us, but consistent with  it. In one of the two excepted cases, the master had hired the slave  in the State of Illinois from 1817 to 1825. In the other, the master  was an officer in the army, and removed with his slave to the military  post of Fort Snelling, and at Prairie du Chien, in Michigan,  temporarily, while acting under the orders of his Government. It is  conceded the decision in this case was departed from in the case  before us, and in those that have followed it. But it is to be  observed that these subsequent cases are in conformity with those in  all the slave States bordering on the free--in Kentucky, (2 Marsh.,  476; 5 B. Munroe, 176; 9 Ib., 565)--in Virginia, (1 Rand., 15; 1  Leigh, 172; 10 Grattan, 495)--in Maryland, (4 Harris and McHenry, 295,  322, 325.) In conformity, also, with the law of England on this  subject, Ex parte Grace, (2 Hagg. Adm., R., 94,) and with the opinions  of the most eminent jurists of the country. (Story's Confl., 396 a; 2  Kent Com., 258 n.; 18 Pick., 193, Chief Justice Shaw. See Corresp.  between Lord Stowell and Judge Story, 1 vol. Life of Story, p. 552,  558.)    Lord Stowell, in communicating his opinion in the case of the slave  Grace to Judge Story, states, in his letter, what the question was  before him, namely: \"Whether the emancipation of a slave brought to  England insured a complete emancipation to him on his return to his  own country, or whether it only operated as a suspension of slavery in  England, and his original character devolved on him again upon his  return.\" He observed, \"the question had never been examined since an  end was put to slavery fifty years ago,\" having reference to the  decision of Lord Mansfield in the case of Somersett; but the practice,  he observed, \"has regularly been, that on his return to his own  country, the slave resumed his original character of slave.\" And so  Lord Stowell held in the case.    Judge Story, in his letter in reply, observes: \"I have read with great  attention your judgment in the slave case, &c. Upon the fullest  consideration which I have been able to give the subject, I entirely  concur in your views. If I had been called upon to pronounce a  judgment in a like case, I should have certainly arrived at the same  result.\" Again he observes: \"In my native State, (Massachusetts,) the  state of slavery is not recognised as legal; and yet, if a slave  should come hither, and afterwards return to his own home, we should  certainly think that the local law attached upon him, and that his  servile character would be redintegrated.\"    We may remark, in this connection, that the case before the Maryland  court, already referred to, and which was decided in 1799, presented  the same question as that before Lord Stowell, and received a similar  decision. This was nearly thirty years before the decision in that  case, which was in 1828. The Court of Appeals observed, in deciding  the Maryland case, that \"however the laws of Great Britain in such  instances, operating upon such persons there, might interfere so as to  prevent the exercise of certain acts by the masters, not permitted, as  in the case of Somersett, yet, upon the bringing Ann Joice into this  State, (then the province of Maryland,) the relation of master and  slave continued in its extent, as authorized by the laws of this  State.\" And Luther Martin, one of the counsel in that case, stated, on  the argument, that the question had been previously decided the same  way in the case of slaves returning from a residence in Pennsylvania,  where they had become free under her laws.    The State of Louisiana, whose courts had gone further in holding the  slave free on his return from a residence in a free State than the  courts of her sister States, has settled the law, by an act of her  Legislature, in conformity with the law of the court of Missouri in  the case before us. (Sess. Law, 1846.)    The case before Lord Stowell presented much stronger features for  giving effect to the law of England in the case of the slave Grace  than exists in the cases that have arisen in this country, for in that  case the slave returned to a colony of England over which the Imperial  Government exercised supreme authority. Yet, on the return of the  slave to the colony, from a temporary residence in England, he held  that the original condition of the slave attached. The question  presented in cases arising here is as to the effect and operation to  be given to the laws of a foreign State, on the return of the slave  within an independent sovereignty.    Upon the whole, it must be admitted that the current of authority,  both in England and in this country, is in accordance with the law as  declared by the courts of Missouri in the case before us, and we think  the court below was not only right, but bound to follow it.    Some question has been made as to the character of the residence in  this case in the free State. But we regard the facts as set forth in  the agreed case as decisive. The removal of Dr. Emerson from Missouri  to the military posts was in the discharge of his duties as surgeon in  the army, and under the orders of his Government. He was liable at any  moment to be recalled, as he was in 1838, and ordered to another post."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31427"],[0,"Miscellaneous Writings, 1883-1896 (#20)"],[1,"ence, increase rapidly as  years glide on. [25]    As Christian Scientists, you have dared the perilous de-  fense of Truth, and have succeeded. You have learned  how fleeting is that which men call great; and how per-  manent that which God calls good.    [Page 111.]    You have proven that the greatest piety is scarcely [1]  sufficient to demonstrate what you have adopted and  taught; that your work, well done, would dignify angels.    Faithfully, as meekly, you have toiled all night; and  at break of day caught much. At times, your net has [5]  been so full that it broke: human pride, creeping into  its meshes, extended it beyond safe expansion; then,  losing hold of divine Love, you lost your fishes, and pos-  sibly blamed others more than yourself. But those whom  God makes \"fishers of men\" will not pull for the shore; [10]  like Peter, they launch into the depths, cast their nets  on the right side, compensate loss, and gain a higher sense  of the true idea. Nothing is lost that God gives: had He  filled the net, it would not have broken.    Leaving the seed of Truth to its own vitality, it propa- [15]  gates: the tares cannot hinder it. Our Master said,  \"Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall  not pass away;\" and Jesus' faith in Truth must not ex-  ceed that of Christian Scientists who prove its power to  be immortal. [20]    The Christianity that is merely of sects, the pulpit, and  fashionable society, is brief; but the Word of God abideth.  Plato was a pagan; but no greater difference existed be-  tween his doctrines and those of Jesus, than to-day exists  between the Catholic and Protestant sects. I love the [25]  orthodox church; and, in time, that church will love  Christian Science. Let me specially call the attention of  this Association to the following false beliefs inclining  mortal mind more deviously:--    The belief in anti-Christ: that somebody in the flesh [30]  is the son of God, or is another Christ, or is a spiritually  adopted child, or is an incarnated babe, is the evil one--    [Page 112.]    in other words, the one evil--disporting itself with the [1]  subtleties of sin!    Even honest thinkers, not knowing whence they come,  may deem these delusions verities, before they know it,  or really look the illusions in the face. The ages are bur- [5]  dened with material modes. Hypnotism, microbes, X-rays,  and ex-common sense, occupy time and thought; and  error, given new opportunities, will improve them. The  most just man can neither defend the innocent nor detect  the guilty, unless he knows _how_ to be just; and this knowl- [10]  edge demands our time and attention.    The mental stages of crime, which seem to belong to  the latter days, are strictly classified in metaphysics as  some of the many features and forms of what is properly  denominated, in extreme cases, moral idiocy. I visited [15]  in his cell the assassin of President Garfield, and found  him in the mental state called moral idiocy. He had no  sense of his crime; but regarded his act as one of simple  justice, and himself as the victim. My few words touched  him; he sank back in his chair, limp and pale; his flip- [20]  pancy had fled. The jailer thanked me, and said, \"Other  visitors have brought to him bouquets, but you have  brought what will do him good.\"    This mental disease at first shows itself in extreme  sensitiveness; then, in a loss of self-knowledge and of [25]  self-condemnation,--a shocking inability to see one's  own faults, but an exaggerating sense of other people's.  Unless this mental condition be overcome, it ends in a  total loss of moral, intellectual, and spiritual discernment,  and is characterized in this Scripture: \"The fool hath [30]  said in his heart, There is no God.\" This state of mind  is the exemplification of total depravity, and the result    [Page 113.]    of sensuous mind in matter. Mind that is God is not in [1]  matter; and God's presence gives spiritual light, wherein  is no darkness.    If, as is indisputably true, \"God is Spirit,\" and Spirit  is our Father and Mother, and that which it includes is [5]  all that is real and eternal, when evil seems to predomi-  nate and divine light to be obscured, free moral agency  is lost; and the Revelator's vision, that \"no man might  buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the  beast, or the number of his name,\" is imminent. [10]    Whoever is mentally manipulating human mind, and  is not gaining a higher sense of Truth by it, is losing in  the scale of moral and spiritual being, and may be car-  ried to the depths of perdition by his own consent. He  who refuses to be influenced by any but the divine Mind, [15]  commits his way to God, and rises superior to sugges-  tions from an evil source. Christian Science shows that  there is a way of escape from the latter-day ultimatum  of evil, through scientific truth; so that all are without  excuse. [20]    Already I clearly recognize that mental malpractice,  if persisted in, will end in insanity, dementia, or moral  idiocy. Thank God! this evil can be resisted by true  Christianity. Divine Love is our hope, strength, and  shield. We have nothing to fear when Love is at the [25]  helm of thought, but everything to enjoy on earth and  in heaven.    The systematized centres of Christian Science are life-  giving fountains of truth. Our churches, _The Christian_  _Science Journal_, and the _Christian Science Quarterly_, [30]  are prolific sources of spiritual power whose intellectual,  moral, and spiritual animus is felt throughout the land.    [Page 114.]    Our Publishing Society, and our Sunday Lessons, are [1]  of inestimable value to all seekers after Truth. The Com-  mittee on Sunday School Lessons cannot give too much  time and attention to their task, and should spare no  research in the preparation of the _Quarterly_ as an educa- [5]  tional branch.    The teachers of Christian Science need to watch inces-  santly the trend of their own thoughts; watch that these  be not secretly robbed, and themselves misguided, and  so made to misteach others. Teachers must conform [10]  strictly to the rules of divine Science announced in the  Bible and their textbook, \"Science and Health with Key  to the Scriptures.\" They must themselves practise, and  teach others to practise, the Hebrew Decalogue, the Ser-  mon on the Mount, and the understanding and enuncia- [15]  tion of these according to Christ.    They must always have on armor, and resist the foe  within and without. They cannot arm too thoroughly  against original sin, appearing in its myriad forms: pass-  sion, appetites, hatred, revenge, and all the _et cetera_ of [20]  evil. Christian Scientists cannot watch too sedulously,  or bar their doors too closely, or pray to God too fer-  vently, for deliverance from the claims of evil. Thus  doing, Scientists will silence evil suggestions, uncover  their methods, and stop their hidden influence upon the [25]  lives of mortals. Rest assured that God in His wisdom  will test all mankind on all questions; and then, if found  faithful, He will deliver us from temptation and show us  the powerlessness of evil,--even its utter nothingness.    The teacher in Christian Science who does not spe- [30]  cially instruct his pupils how to guard against evil and  its silent modes, and to be able, through Christ, the liv-    [Page 115.]    ing Truth, to protect themselves therefrom, is commit- [1]  ting an offense against God and humanity. With Science  and Health for their textbook, I am astounded at the  apathy of some students on the subject of sin and mental  malpractice, and their culpable ignorance of the work- [5]  ing of these--and even the teacher's own deficiency in  this department. I can account for this state of mind in  the teacher only as the result of sin; otherwise, his own  guilt as a mental malpractitioner, and fear of being found  out. [10]    The helpless ignorance of the community on this sub-  ject is pitiable, and plain to be seen. May God enable  my students to take up the cross as I have done, and meet  the pressing need of a proper preparation of heart to prac-  tise, teach, and live Christian Science! Your means of [15]  protection and defense from sin are, constant watchful-  ness and prayer that you enter not into temptation and  are delivered from every claim of evil, till you intelligently  know and demonstrate, in Science, that evil has neither  prestige, power, nor existence, since God, good, is All- [20]  in-all.    The increasing necessity for relying on God to de-  fend us against the subtler forms of evil, turns us more  unreservedly to Him for help, and thus becomes a means  of grace. If one lives rightly, every effort to hurt one [25]  will only help that one; for God will give the ability to  overcome whatever tends to impede progress. Know  this: that you cannot overcome the baneful effects of  sin on yourself, if you in any way indulge in sin; for,  sooner or later, you will fall the victim of your own as [30]  well as of others' sins. Using mental power in the right  direction only, doing to others as you would have them    [Page 116.]    do to you, will overcome evil with good, and destroy [1]  your own sensitiveness to the power of evil.    The God of all grace be with you, and save you from  \"spiritual wickedness in high places.\"    PLEASANT VIEW, CONCORD, N.
