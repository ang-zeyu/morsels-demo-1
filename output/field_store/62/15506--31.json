Then they told him dinner would be served directly and he replied that  they could not serve it too quickly to suit his convenience. First they  brought him a steaming bowl of soup, which the horse eyed in dismay.    \"Take that stuff away!\" he commanded. \"Do you take me for a  salamander?\"    They obeyed at once, and next served a fine large turbot on a silver  platter, with drawn gravey poured over it.    \"Fish!\" cried Jim, with a sniff. \"Do you take me for a tom-cat? Away  with it!\"    The servants were a little discouraged, but soon they brought in a great  tray containing two dozen nicely roasted quail on toast.    \"Well, well!\" said the horse, now thoroughly provoked. \"Do you take me  for a weasel? How stupid and ignorant you are, in the Land of Oz, and  what dreadful things you feed upon! Is there nothing that is decent to  eat in this palace?\"    The trembling servants sent for the Royal Steward, who came in haste and  said:    \"What would your Highness like for dinner?\"    \"Highness!\" repeated Jim, who was unused to such titles.    \"You are at least six feet high, and that is higher than any other  animal in this country,\" said the Steward.    \"Well, my Highness would like some oats,\" declared the horse.    \"Oats? We have no whole oats,\" the Steward replied, with much  defference. \"But there is any quantity of oatmeal, which we often cook  for breakfast. Oatmeal is a breakfast dish,\" added the Steward, humbly.    \"I'll make it a dinner dish,\" said Jim. \"Fetch it on, but don't cook it,  as you value your life.\"    You see, the respect shown the worn-out old cab-horse made him a little  arrogant, and he forgot he was a guest, never having been treated  otherwise than as a servant since the day he was born, until his arrival  in the Land of Oz. But the royal attendants did not heed the animal's  ill temper. They soon mixed a tub of oatmeal with a little water, and  Jim ate it with much relish.    Then the servants heaped a lot of rugs upon the floor and the old horse  slept on the softest bed he had ever known in his life.    In the morning, as soon as it was daylight, he resolved to take a walk  and try to find some grass for breakfast; so he ambled calmly through  the handsome arch of the doorway, turned the corner of the palace,  wherein all seemed asleep, and came face to face with the Sawhorse.    Jim stopped abruptly, being startled and amazed. The Sawhorse stopped at  the same time and stared at the other with its queer protruding eyes,  which were mere knots in the log that formed its body. The legs of the  Sawhorse were four sticks driven into holes bored in the log; its tail  was a small branch that had been left by accident and its mouth a place  chopped in one end of the body which projected a little and served as  a head. The ends of the wooden legs were shod with plates of solid gold,  and the saddle of the Princess Ozma, which was of red leather set with  sparkling diamonds, was strapped to the clumsy body.    [Illustration: \"FOR GOODNESS SAKE, WHAT SORT OF A BEING ARE YOU?\"]    Jim's eyes stuck out as much as those of the Sawhorse, and he stared at  the creature with his ears erect and his long head drawn back until it  rested against his arched neck.    In this comical position the two horses circled slowly around each other  for a while, each being unable to realize what the singular thing might  be which it now beheld for the first time. Then Jim exclaimed:    \"For goodness sake, what sort of a being are you?\"    \"I'm a Sawhorse,\" replied the other.    \"Oh; I believe I've heard of you,\" said the cab-horse; \"but you are  unlike anything that I expected to see.\"    \"I do not doubt it,\" the Sawhorse observed, with a tone of pride. \"I am  considered quite unusual.\"    \"You are, indeed. But a rickety wooden thing like you has no right to be  alive.\"    \"I couldn't help it,\" returned the other, rather crestfallen. \"Ozma  sprinkled me with a magic powder, and I just had to live. I know I'm not  much account; but I'm the only horse in all the Land of Oz, so they  treat me with great respect.\"    \"You, a horse!\"    \"Oh, not a real one, of course. There are no real horses here at all.  But I'm a splendid imitation of one.\"    Jim gave an indignant neigh.    \"Look at me!\" he cried. \"Behold a real horse!\"    The wooden animal gave a start, and then examined the other intently.    \"Is it possible that you are a Real Horse?\" he murmured.    \"Not only possible, but true,\" replied Jim, who was gratified by the  impression he had created. \"It is proved by my fine points. For example,  look at the long hairs on my tail, with which I can whisk away the  flies.\"    \"The flies never trouble me,\" said the Saw-Horse.    \"And notice my great strong teeth, with which I nibble the grass.\"    \"It is not necessary for me to eat,\" observed the Saw-horse.    \"Also examine my broad chest, which enables me to draw deep, full  breaths,\" said Jim, proudly.    \"I have no need to breathe,\" returned the other.    \"No; you miss many pleasures,\" remarked the cab-horse, pityingly. \"You  do not know the relief of brushing away a fly that has bitten you, nor  the delight of eating delicious food, nor the satisfaction of drawing a  long breath of fresh, pure air. You may be an imitation of a horse, but  you're a mighty poor one.\"    \"Oh, I cannot hope ever to be like you,\" sighed the Sawhorse. \"But I am  glad to meet at last a Real Horse. You are certainly the most beautiful  creature I ever beheld.\"    This praise won Jim completely. To be called beautiful was a novelty in  his experience. Said he:    \"Your chief fault, my friend, is in being made of wood, and that I  suppose you cannot help. Real horses, like myself, are made of flesh and  blood and bones.\"    \"I can see the bones all right,\" replied the Sawhorse, \"and they are  admirable and distinct. Also I can see the flesh. But the blood, I  suppose, is tucked away inside.\"    \"Exactly,\" said Jim.    \"What good is it?\" asked the Sawhorse.    Jim did not know, but he would not tell the Sawhorse that.    \"If anything cuts me,\" he replied, \"the blood runs out to show where I  am cut. You, poor thing! cannot even bleed when you are hurt.\"    \"But I am never hurt,\" said the Sawhorse. \"Once in a while I get broken  up some, but I am easily repaired and put in good order again. And I  never feel a break or a splinter in the least.\"    Jim was almost tempted to envy the wooden horse for being unable to feel  pain; but the creature was so absurdly unnatural that he decided he  would not change places with it under any circumstances.    \"How did you happen to be shod with gold?\" he asked.    \"Princess Ozma did that,\" was the reply; \"and it saves my legs from  wearing out. We've had a good many adventures together, Ozma and I, and  she likes me.\"    The cab-horse was about to reply when suddenly he gave a start and a  neigh of terror and stood trembling like a leaf. For around the corner  had come two enormous savage beasts, treading so lightly that they were  upon him before he was aware of their presence. Jim was in the act of  plunging down the path to escape when the Sawhorse cried out:    \"Stop, my brother! Stop, Real Horse! These are friends, and will do you  no harm.\"    Jim hesitated, eyeing the beasts fearfully. One was an enormous Lion  with clear, intelligent eyes, a tawney mane bushy and well kept, and a  body like yellow plush. The other was a great Tiger with purple stripes  around his lithe body, powerful limbs, and eyes that showed through the  half closed lids like coals of fire. The huge forms of these monarchs of  the forest and jungle were enough to strike terror to the stoutest  heart, and it is no wonder Jim was afraid to face them.    But the Sawhorse introduced the stranger in a calm tone, saying,    \"This, noble Horse, is my friend the Cowardly Lion, who is the valiant  King of the Forest, but at the same time a faithful vassal of Princess  Ozma. And this is the Hungry Tiger, the terror of the jungle, who longs  to devour fat babies but is prevented by his conscience from doing so.  These royal beasts are both warm friends of little Dorothy and have come  to the Emerald City this morning to welcome her to our fairyland.\"    Hearing these words Jim resolved to conquer his alarm. He bowed his head  with as much dignity as he could muster toward the savage looking  beasts, who in return nodded in a friendly way.    \"Is not the Real Horse a beautiful animal?\" asked the Sawhorse  admiringly.    \"That is doubtless a matter of taste,\" returned the Lion. \"In the forest  he would be thought ungainly, because his face is stretched out and his  neck is uselessly long. His joints, I notice, are swollen and overgrown,  and he lacks flesh and is old in years.\"    \"And dreadfully tough,\" added the Hungry Tiger, in a sad voice. \"My  conscience would never permit me to eat so tough a morsel as the Real  Horse.\"    \"I'm glad of that,\" said Jim; \"for I, also, have a conscience, and it  tells me not to crush in your skull with a blow of my powerful hoof.\"    If he thought to frighten the striped beast by such language he was  mistaken. The Tiger seemed to smile, and winked one eye slowly.    \"You have a good conscience, friend Horse,\" it said, \"and if you attend  to its teachings it will do much to protect you from harm. Some day I  will let you try to crush in my skull, and afterward you will know more  about tigers than you do now.\"    \"Any friend of Dorothy,\" remarked the Cowardly Lion, \"must be our  friend, as well. So let us cease this talk of skull crushing and  converse upon more pleasant subjects. Have you breakfasted, Sir Horse?\"    \"Not yet,\" replied Jim. \"But here is plenty of excellent clover, so if  you will excuse me I will eat now.\"    \"He's a vegetarian,\" remarked the Tiger, as the horse began to munch the  clover. \"If I could eat grass I would not need a conscience, for nothing  could then tempt me to devour babies and lambs.\"    Just"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22567"],[0,"History of the United States, Volume 2 (#20)"],[1,"title itself giving way after about 1810 to   simple \"democratic.\"      [Illustration: Portrait.]  John Adams  From a copy by Jane Stuart, about 1874, of a painting by her father,  Gilbert Stuart, about 1800--in possession of Henry Adams.      Hostility to England, the memory of France's aid to us in our hour of  need, the doctrine of \"the rights of man,\" then so much in vogue, the  known sympathies of Jefferson and Madison, who were already popular,  and, alas, a mean wish to hamper the administration, all helped to swell  the ranks of those who swung their hats for France. A far deeper motive  with the more thoughtful was the belief that neutrality violated our  treaty of 1778 with France, a conclusion at present beyond question.  Politically our policy may have been wise, morally it was wrong.    The administration, at least its honored head, was doubtless innocent of  any intentional injustice; and it could certainly urge a great deal in  justification of its course. The form and the aims of the French  Government had changed since the treaty originated, involving a state of  things which that instrument had not contemplated.  France herself  defied international law and compact, revolutionizing and incorporating  Holland and Geneva, and assaulting our commerce. And war with England  then threatened our ruin. Yet the pleading of these considerations in  that so trying hour, even had they been wholly pertinent, could not but  seem to Frenchmen treason to the cause of liberty. As to many  Federalists, trucklers to England, such a charge would have been true.    France was not slow to reciprocate in the matter of grievances. In fact,  so early as May, 1793, before the proclamation of neutrality could have  been heard of in that country, orders had been issued there, wholly  repugnant to the treaty (which had ordained that neutral ships could  carry what goods they pleased--free ships, free goods), to capture and  condemn English merchandise on American vessels. Provisions owned by  Americans and en route to England were also to be forfeited as  contraband. Even the most reasonable French officials seemed bent on  treating our country as a dependency of France.    We see this in the actions of Genet, the first envoy to America from the  French constitutional monarchy, accredited hither by a ministry of  high-minded Republicans while Louis XVI. still sat upon his throne.  Genet arrived in Charleston in 1793, before our neutrality had been  proclaimed. Immediately, before presenting his credentials to our  Government, he set about fitting out privateers, manning them with  Americans, and sending them to prey upon British ships, some of which  they captured in American waters. All this was in utter derogation of  the treaty, which only guaranteed shelter to bona fide French vessels.  Under a law of the French National Convention, Genet assumed to erect  the French consulates in this country into so many admiralty courts for  the trial of British prizes. We could not have allowed this without  decidedly violating international law at least in spirit. He also  devised and partly arranged expeditions of Americans, to start, one from  Georgia to invade Florida, another from Kentucky to capture New Orleans,  both as means of weakening Spain, which up to this time and for several  years later was France's foe.    [1795]    But Genet's worst gall came out in his conduct toward Washington. Him he  insulted, challenging his motives and his authority for his acts and  threatening to appeal from him to the people. He tried to bully and  browbeat the whole cabinet as if they had been so many boys. So  ludicrous did he make himself by such useless bluster, that his friends,  at first numerous and many of them influential, gave him the cold  shoulder, and the ardor for France greatly cooled. At length Washington  effected his removal, the more easily, it would seem, as he was not  radical enough for the Jacobins, who had now succeeded to the helm in  France. The officious Frenchman did not return to his own country, but  settled down in New York, marrying a daughter of Governor Clinton. He  was succeeded by Adet.      [Illustration: Portrait.]  George Clinton.  From a painting by Ezra Ames.      Upon learning that the United States had ratified Jay's treaty, France  went insane with rage. A declaration of war by us could not have angered  her more. Adet was called home and the alliance with America declared at  an end. Barras dismissed Mr. Monroe, our minister, in a contemptuous  speech, and Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, sent as Monroe's successor, was  not only not received but ordered from the land. New and worse decrees  went forth against American commerce. Our ships were confiscated for  carrying English goods though not contraband. Arbitrary and unheard-of  tests of neutrality were trumped up, wholly contrary to the treaty,  which indeed was now denounced. American sailors found serving, though  compelled, on British armed vessels, were to be condemned as pirates.    [1797]    These brutal measures, coupled with Napoleon's increasing power, begot  in America the belief, even among Republicans, that France's struggle  was no longer for liberty but for conquest. The insolence of the French  Government waxed insufferable. President Adams, to a special session of  the Vth Congress, on May 19, 1797, announced the insult to the nation in  the person of Pinckney, and urged preparation for war. A goodly loan, a  direct tax, and a provisional army, Washington again leader, were  readily voted. Our Navy Department was created at this time. The navy  was increased, and several captures were made of French vessels guilty  of outrage. Adams, however, to make a last overture for peace,  despatched John Marshall and Elbridge Gerry to the aid of Pinckney, the  three to knock once more at France's doors for a becoming admission. In  vain. The only effect was a new chapter of French mendacity and  insolence, furthering America's wish and preparations for war.  Napoleon's recent Italian victories, terrifying Europe, had puffed up  France with pride. Talleyrand assumed to arraign us as criminals, and  what was worse, pressed us, through his agents, to buy his country's  forgiveness with gold. \"You must pay money,\" our envoys were told, and  \"a good deal of it, too.\"      [Illustration: Portrait.]  John Marshall.      All this was duly made known at Philadelphia, and the President assured  Congress that no terms were obtainable from France \"compatible with the  safety, honor, and general interest of the nation.\" The opposition  thought this an exaggeration, and called for the despatches, expecting  refusal or abridgment. The President sent every word.      [Illustration: Portrait.]  Elbridge Gerry      Confusion seized the Republicans. Federalists were again in the  ascendant, the VIth Congress being much more strongly federalist than  the Vth. For once proud, reserved John Adams was popular, and  anti-French feeling irresistible. \"Millions for defence but not a cent  for tribute,\" echoed through the land. Hosts of Republicans went over to  the administration side. Patriotism became a passion. Each night at the  theatre rose a universal call for the \"President's March\" [Footnote: The  music was that of our \"Hail Columbia.\"] and \"Yankee Doodle,\" the  audience rising, cheering, swinging hats and canes, and roaring  \"encore.\" The black cockade, American, on all hands supplanted the  tricolor cockade worn by the \"Gallomaniacs;\" and bands of \"Associated  Youth,\" organizing in every town and city, deluged the President with  patriotic addresses.    Seeing that we could not be bullied and that the friends of France here  were Americans first; ashamed, on their publication, of the indignities  which he had offered our envoys, and after all not wishing war with what  he saw to be potentially another naval power like England, the sly  Talleyrand neatly receded from his arrogant demands, and expressed a  desire to negotiate.        CHAPTER VI.    THE DECLINE OF THE FEDERALIST PARTY    [1797]    The heat of the nation's wrath evoked by this conflict with France  betrayed the Federalists in Congress into some pieces of tyrannical  legislation. These were especially directed against refugees from  France, lest they should attempt to reenact here the bloody drama just  played out there. Combinations were alleged, without proof, to exist  between American and French democrats, dangerous to the stability of  this Government.    A new naturalization act was passed, requiring of an immigrant, as  prerequisite to citizenship, fourteen years of residence instead of the  five heretofore sufficient. Next came three alien acts, empowering the  President, at his discretion, without trial or even a statement of his  reasons, to banish foreigners from the land; any who should return  unbidden being liable to imprisonment for three years, and cut off from  the possibility of citizenship forever. A \"sedition act\" followed, to  fine in the sum of $5,000 each and to imprison for five years any  persons stirring up sedition, combining to oppose governmental measures,  resisting United States law, or putting forth \"any false, scandalous, or  malicious writings\" against Congress, the President, or the Government.    To President Adams's credit, he was no abettor of these hateful decrees,  and did little to enforce them. The sedition law, however, did not rest  with him for execution, and was applied right and left. Evidently its  champions were swayed largely by political motives. Matthew Lyon, a  fiery Republican member of Congress from Vermont, had, in an address to  his constituents, charged the President with avarice and with \"thirst  for ridiculous pomp and foolish adulation,\" He was convicted of  sedition, fined $1,000, and sentenced to four months in prison. This  impoverished him, as well as took him from his place in Congress for  most of a session."]]]
