As to their separations, there had been several. To  begin, Charlie had been in college a year after he (Robert) had been  graduated, and the following year, \"because the boy had seemed run down  and in need of rest and change,\" he had spent a few months upon a ranch  in Wyoming with a college friend. Then the two had made their European  tour, and since, their only long separations had been when his work as  journalist had taken him away from the city, sometimes for weeks, until  Charlie had taken this school as a relief from his theological studies.    From Mr. Myers he could only learn that the father and mother of Robert  and Charles Brierly were of good families, well known in their  respective states, and both, he believed, \"were as distinctly Americans  as the war of the Revolution could make any American citizen of English  descent.\" As to Charlie Brierly, Myers \"didn't believe the boy had ever  looked twice at a girl until he met with that lovely, sad-eyed  sweetheart who, it was plain, was wearing out her heart in silent grief  for him.\"    Then Ferrars went to see his supposed cousin, and asked her to review,  mentally, her latest talks with her lover, and to see if she could not  recall some mention of a discovery, a surprise, a perplexity possibly,  which he wished to lay before his brother when he should come. But she  shook her head sadly.    \"Was he, to her knowledge, in the habit of collecting odd things from  the newspapers?\"    She shook her head. \"He did not think very highly of our daily papers,  and seldom if ever read beyond the news of the day. The scandals and  criminal reports he abhorred,\" she said.    \"And he never alluded in any way to his family history, you say? Think,  was there no mention of family facts or names?\"    She looked up after some moments of thought. \"I can only recall one  thing which, after all, does not contain information, except as regards  the two brothers. Charlie was speaking of the difference of their  temperaments. Robert, he said, was intensely practical, living in and  enjoying most, the present, and by anticipation, the future, while he  (Charlie) was a dreamer, loving the past, and idealising its history. To  illustrate, he told how, as boys, he loved to hear his mother, whom I  fancy he resembled, tell the tales she had heard at her grandmother's  knee, of the early days, the French convents, the Indians, the  colonists, the quaint living, the speech, which had for him such charms,  while Robert would only hear of the fighting and would run away from the  ancestral history.\"    Hilda, grown accustomed to his numerous queries and scant explanations,  was not surprised at Ferrars' hurried departure at the end of the  catechism, and he went back to the doctor's cottage with just one faint  little possibility as a reward for all this interviewing. He had known  Mr. Myers in the city, as a successful detective is apt to know an able  lawyer, well by reputation and personally a little, and he was glad to  find in him a friend to the Brierlys, dead and living.    Going back that night he said to himself:    \"It's of no use to try to go on like this; a confidant will save me a  lot of time, and Myers is the man. I can't call upon the doctor; he's  got his profession, and he belongs here. Myers can make my business and  Brierly's his at need. Besides, he's a lawyer and won't be knocked  entirely out by my wild theorising, and he's the one man who can get  access to the ancestral documents at need.\"    He found the lawyer still upon the doctor's piazza, and without the  least attempt at explanation invited him into his own room, where they  were still closeted when, at midnight, Robert Brierly went slowly toward  the Fry cottage, and the doctor, who never got his full quota of sleep,  went yawning off to bed.    Mr. Myers spent five days in Glenville, and then went back to the city,  taking Robert Brierly with him, \"for a purpose,\" as he said to the  doctor and Ferrars. \"He can come back in a day or two if he chooses,\"  the lawyer added, \"but in truth, Robert, unless you're needed here,  which I doubt, you'll be better at work. Mr. 'Ferriss-Grant,' here, will  summon you at need.\"    When they were on board the train, and the lawyer had exhausted the  morning paper, he drew close to his companion in that confidential  attitude travellers fall into when they do not converse for the  entertainment of all on board, and said:    \"Robert, I want to tell you why I so insisted upon your company back to  the city. I want you to rouse yourself, to open your house, and when you  first have looked over your father's and mother's private and business  papers, I want you to turn over to me all such as are not too sacred for  other eyes than yours; all letters, journals--if there are such--all, in  fact, that deal in any way with your family, friends, and family  history.\"    Brierly turned to look in his face.    \"This is some of Ferrars' planning,\" he said.    \"It is, and it has my hearty endorsement. Don't ask questions. Frank  Ferrars knows what he is about.\"    \"No doubt of it. I only wish I did.\"    \"You'll know at the right time. And if it will be a comfort to you, I'll  admit that, while I am to a certain degree in his confidence, I know no  more what or whom he suspects than you do, for he won't accuse without  proof of guilt, however much he suspects or believes. But I know this,  Ferrars is convinced that the secret of your brother's death lies in the  past.\"    \"And in whose past?\"    \"In his own, in that of your family, or of Hilda Grant.\"    At the beginning of the following week Hilda Grant resumed her duties as  school mistress, the place of Charles Brierly being filled by a young  student from the city.    Mrs. Jamieson, meantime, had called upon Hilda, the call had been  returned, and the two were now upon quite a friendly and sympathetic  footing; it was not long before the fair, black-robed little figure was  quite familiar to the children, to whom she gave generously sweets,  pleasant words and smiles.    Sometimes she met Ferrars, who would look in now and then at the recess  or noon hour to keep up his cousinly character, and Hilda Grant's clear  eyes saw, day by day, the blue eyes of the pretty widow taking on a new  look and noted that, while she was at all other times full of easy,  charming chat, the approach of \"Mr. Grant,\" would close the pretty lips  and cause the white eyelids to quiver and fall.    The understanding between Hilda and the detective was now almost  perfect, and one day, Ferrars, having asked her if she had ever heard  Mrs. Jamieson speak of leaving Glenville, or name her place of  residence, Hilda replied--    \"I have heard her express herself as well pleased with Glenville, and I  think she is in no haste to go. In truth, Mr. Ferrars, I am beginning to  feel that, in seeing this lady as a means toward a selfish end, we, or  I, have done wrong. That she is a woman of the world, and has seen much  of good society, is evident, but she has lived, of late, a lonely and  much secluded life, she tells me, her late husband having been a  somewhat exacting invalid for two years before his death; and forgive me  for my great frankness, I fear that because of your absorption in this  trouble of mine, you have not thought or observed, how 'much' your  acquaintance is becoming to Mrs. Jamieson. One woman can read another as  a man cannot, and I must not let you serve me at the cost of another's  happiness perhaps.\"    \"Miss Grant, is this a riddle?\"    \"Mr. Ferrars, no. Must I say plainly, then, that you are making yourself  quite too interesting to this lady?\"    Ferrars turned his face away for a moment. Then he replied slowly, as if  choosing his words with difficulty.    \"My friend, I believe time will prove you the mistaken one. I cannot  take this flattering idea of yours to myself and venture to believe in  it, but should it have the smallest foundation in reality, rest your  conscience upon this candid declaration. The lady cannot feel more  interest in my unworthy self than I in her; from the first moment almost  I have taken an interest in Mrs. Jamieson, such as I have seldom felt  for any woman. Shall we let the subject rest here? Be sure I shall not  let any personal interest conflict with, or supersede, the work I came  here to do.\"    In later years Hilda remembered these words.    During the next two weeks the wheels of progress, so far as Ferrars'  work was concerned, moved slowly, and even rested, or seemed so to do.    To be baffled in a small town, and by a small boy, was something new and  surprising in the experience of detective Ferrars, but so it was. Work  as he would, finesse as he might, he could find no trace of the boy,  \"about half grown, with dark eyes and hair, freckles, a polite way with  him, and a cap pulled over his eyes,\" and this was the best description  Mrs. Fry could give of the strange lad.    \"If Mrs. Fry was not the honest woman she is,\" said the doctor, \"I  should call that boy a myth. How could he come and go so utterly unseen  by all Glenville.\"    Samuel Doran, who still believed that \"Mr. Grant\" was Mr. Grant, and  thought it most natural that he should turn his attention to the  mystery surrounding the murder of \"his cousin's lover,\" thought  otherwise.    \"Pshaw!\" he objected, \"look at the raff of half-grown boys racing up and  down these streets from sunset to pretty late bedtime, for kids, and how  much different does one boy look from another in the dark? Mrs. Fry  herself only saw him out in the twilight.\"    Ferrars reserved his criticism and opinions for the time.    Doran had taken upon himself the investigation of the \"boat puzzle,\" as  he called it, for the skiff remained, after many days, still drawn up,  unmoored and unclaimed, by the lake shore; and at last, by dint of much  driving up and down the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3533"],[0,"Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town (#20)"],[1," the case and dismissed the protest of the  company in less than fifteen minutes! Just what the jurisdiction  of Judge Pepperleigh's court is I don't know, but I do know that in  upholding the rights of a Christian congregation--I am quoting here the  text of the decision--against the intrigues of a set of infernal skunks  that make too much money, anyway, the Mariposa court is without an  equal. Pepperleigh even threatened the plaintiffs with the penitentiary,  or worse.    How the fire started no one ever knew. There was a queer story that went  about to the effect that Mr. Smith and Mr. Gingham's assistant had been  seen very late that night carrying an automobile can of kerosene up the  street. But that was amply disproved by the proceedings of the court,  and by the evidence of Mr. Smith himself. He took his dying oath,--not  his ordinary one as used in the License cases, but his dying one,--that  he had not carried a can of kerosene up the street, and that anyway it  was the rottenest kind of kerosene he had ever seen and no more use than  so much molasses. So that point was settled.    Dean Drone? Did he get well again? Why, what makes you ask that? You  mean, was his head at all affected after the stroke? No, it was not.  Absolutely not. It was not affected in the least, though how anybody who  knows him now in Mariposa could have the faintest idea that his mind was  in any way impaired by the stroke is more than I can tell. The engaging  of Mr. Uttermost, the curate, whom perhaps you have heard preach in the  new church, had nothing whatever to do with Dean Drone's head. It was  merely a case of the pressure of overwork. It was felt very generally  by the wardens that, in these days of specialization, the rector was  covering too wide a field, and that if he should abandon some of the  lesser duties of his office, he might devote his energies more intently  to the Infant Class. That was all. You may hear him there any afternoon,  talking to them, if you will stand under the maple trees and listen  through the open windows of the new Infant School.    And, as for audiences, for intelligence, for attention--well, if I want  to find listeners who can hear and understand about the great spaces  of Lake Huron, let me tell of it, every time face to face with the blue  eyes of the Infant Class, fresh from the infinity of spaces greater  still. Talk of grown-up people all you like, but for listeners let me  have the Infant Class with their pinafores and their Teddy Bears and  their feet not even touching the floor, and Mr. Uttermost may preach to  his heart's content of the newer forms of doubt revealed by the higher  criticism.    So you will understand that the Dean's mind is, if anything, even  keener, and his head even clearer than before. And if you want proof of  it, notice him there beneath the plum blossoms reading in the Greek:  he has told me that he finds that he can read, with the greatest ease,  works in the Greek that seemed difficult before. Because his head is so  clear now.    And sometimes,--when his head is very clear,--as he sits there reading  beneath the plum blossoms he can hear them singing beyond, and his  wife's voice.          SEVEN. The Extraordinary Entanglement of Mr. Pupkin    Judge Pepperleigh lived in a big house with hardwood floors and a wide  piazza that looked over the lake from the top of Oneida Street.    Every day about half-past five he used to come home from his office in  the Mariposa Court House. On some days as he got near the house he would  call out to his wife:    \"Almighty Moses, Martha! who left the sprinkler on the grass?\"    On other days he would call to her from quite a little distance off:  \"Hullo, mother! Got any supper for a hungry man?\"    And Mrs. Pepperleigh never knew which it would be. On the days when he  swore at the sprinkler you could see his spectacles flash like dynamite.  But on the days when he called: \"Hullo, mother,\" they were simply  irradiated with kindliness.    Some days, I say, he would cry out with a perfect whine of indignation:  \"Suffering Caesar! has that infernal dog torn up those geraniums again?\"  And other days you would hear him singing out: \"Hullo, Rover! Well,  doggie, well, old fellow!\"    In the same way at breakfast, the judge, as he looked over the  morning paper, would sometimes leap to his feet with a perfect howl of  suffering, and cry: \"Everlasting Moses! the Liberals have carried East  Elgin.\" Or else he would lean back from the breakfast table with  the most good-humoured laugh you ever heard and say: \"Ha! ha! the  Conservatives have carried South Norfolk.\"    And yet he was perfectly logical, when you come to think of it. After  all, what is more annoying to a sensitive, highly-strung man than an  infernal sprinkler playing all over the place, and what more agreeable  to a good-natured, even-tempered fellow than a well-prepared supper? Or,  what is more likeable than one's good, old, affectionate dog bounding  down the path from sheer delight at seeing you,--or more execrable than  an infernal whelp that has torn up the geraniums and is too old to keep,  anyway?    As for politics, well, it all seemed reasonable enough. When the  Conservatives got in anywhere, Pepperleigh laughed and enjoyed it,  simply because it does one good to see a straight, fine, honest fight  where the best man wins. When a Liberal got in, it made him mad, and he  said so,--not, mind you, from any political bias, for his office forbid  it,--but simply because one can't bear to see the country go absolutely  to the devil.    I suppose, too, it was partly the effect of sitting in court all day  listening to cases. One gets what you might call the judicial temper of  mind. Pepperleigh had it so strongly developed that I've seen him kick  a hydrangea pot to pieces with his foot because the accursed thing  wouldn't flower. He once threw the canary cage clear into the lilac  bushes because the \"blasted bird wouldn't stop singing.\" It was a  straight case of judicial temper. Lots of judges have it, developed in  just the same broad, all-round way as with Judge Pepperleigh.      I think it must be passing sentences that does it. Anyway, Pepperleigh  had the aptitude for passing sentences so highly perfected that he spent  his whole time at it inside of court and out. I've heard him hand out  sentences for the Sultan of Turkey and Mrs. Pankhurst and the Emperor of  Germany that made one's blood run cold. He would sit there on the piazza  of a summer evening reading the paper, with dynamite sparks flying from  his spectacles as he sentenced the Czar of Russia to ten years in the  salt mines--and made it fifteen a few minutes afterwards. Pepperleigh  always read the foreign news--the news of things that he couldn't  alter--as a form of wild and stimulating torment.    So you can imagine that in some ways the judge's house was a pretty  difficult house to go to. I mean you can see how awfully hard it must  have been for Mr. Pupkin. I tell you it took some nerve to step up on  that piazza and say, in a perfectly natural, off-hand way: \"Oh, how  do you do, judge? Is Miss Zena in? No, I won't stay, thanks; I think I  ought to be going. I simply called.\" A man who can do that has got to  have a pretty fair amount of savoir what do you call it, and he's got to  be mighty well shaved and have his cameo pin put in his tie at a pretty  undeniable angle before he can tackle it. Yes, and even then he may need  to hang round behind the lilac bushes for half an hour first, and cool  off. And he's apt to make pretty good time down Oneida Street on the way  back.    Still, that's what you call love, and if you've got it, and are well  shaved, and your boots well blacked, you can do things that seem almost  impossible. Yes, you can do anything, even if you do trip over the dog  in getting off the piazza.    Don't suppose for a moment that Judge Pepperleigh was an unapproachable  or a harsh man always and to everybody. Even Mr. Pupkin had to admit  that that couldn't be so. To know that, you had only to see Zena  Pepperleigh put her arm round his neck and call him Daddy. She would do  that even when there were two or three young men sitting on the edge of  the piazza. You know, I think, the way they sit on the edge in Mariposa.  It is meant to indicate what part of the family they have come to see.  Thus when George Duff, the bank manager, came up to the Pepperleigh  house, he always sat in a chair on the verandah and talked to the judge.  But when Pupkin or Mallory Tompkins or any fellow like that came, he sat  down in a sidelong fashion on the edge of the boards and then they knew  exactly what he was there for. If he knew the house well, he leaned his  back against the verandah post and smoked a cigarette. But that took  nerve.    But I am afraid that this is a digression, and, of course, you know all  about it just as well as I do. All that I was trying to say was that I  don't suppose that the judge had ever spoken a cross word to Zena in his  life.--Oh, he threw her novel over the grape-vine, I don't deny that,  but then why on earth should a girl read trash like the Errant Quest of  the Palladin Pilgrim, and the Life of Sir Galahad, when the house was  full of good reading like The Life of Sir John A. Macdonald, and Pioneer  Days in Tecumseh Township?      Still, what I mean is that the judge never spoke harshly to Zena, except  perhaps under extreme provocation; and I am quite sure that he never,  never had to Neil. But then what father ever would want to speak angrily  to such a boy as Neil Pepperleigh? The judge took no credit himself for  that; the finest grown boy in the whole county and so broad and big that  they took him into the Missinaba Horse when he was only seventeen. And  clever,--so clever that he didn't need to study; so clever that he used  to come out at the foot of the class in mathematics at the Mariposa  high school through"]]]
