My friend was very much bored and could  not see that it represented a social point of view, which showed that  the Saint was much ahead of his time! It did not bring old France back  to him; he could not see the old ch[^a]teau and the water in the moonlight,  or conceive how glad the peasants were to be relieved of their duty. I  can read the \"Letters\" of Saint Francis de Sales over and over again, as  I read the \"Letters\" of Madame de S['e]vign['e] or the \"Memoirs\" of the Duc  de Saint Simon.    I think I first made acquaintance of Saint Simon in an English  translation by Bayle St. John. If you have an interest in interiors--the  interiors of rooms, of gardens, of palaces--you must like Saint Simon.  Most people to-day read these \"Memoirs\" in little \"collections\"; but I  think it is worth while taking the trouble to learn French in order to  become an understanding companion of this malicious but very graphic  author. To me the Palace of Versailles would be an empty desert without  the \"Memoirs\" of Saint Simon. Else, how could anybody realize a picture  of Mademoiselle de la Valli[`e]re looking hopelessly out of the window of  her little room just before the birth of her child? Or what would the  chapel be without a memory of those devout ladies who knelt regularly,  holding candles to their faces, at the exercises in Lent, after Louis  XIV. had become devout, in order that he might see them?    But because I love to linger in the society of the Duc de Saint Simon  and Cardinal de Retz, it does not follow that I mean to introduce modern  and ingenuous youth to the society of these gentlemen. Each man has his  pet book. I still retain a great affection for a man of my own age who  gives on birthdays and great feasts copies of \"The Wide, Wide World\" and  \"Queechy\" to his grandchildren and their friends! Could you believe  that? He dislikes Miss Austen's novels and sneers at Miss Farrar's  \"Marriage.\" He has never been able to read Miss Edgeworth's book; and he  considers Pepys's \"Diary\" an immoral book! Now, I find it very hard to  exist without at least a weekly peep into Pepys. And, by the way, in a  number of the _Atlantic Monthly_ not so long ago there is a vivid,  pathetic, and excellently written piece of literature. It is \"A Portion  of the Diurnal of Mrs Eliz^th Pepys\" by E. Barrington.    If anybody asks me why I like Pepys, I do not feel obliged to reply. I  might incriminate myself. Very often, indeed, by answering a direct  question about books, one does incriminate oneself.    However, to return to what I was saying--while I love the \"Memoirs of  Cardinal de Retz,\" I adore--to be a little extravagant--the \"Letters of  Saint Vincent de Paul.\" The man that does not know the real story of the  life of Saint Vincent de Paul knows nothing of the evolution of the  brotherhood of man in the seventeenth century. This Frenchman really  fought with beasts for the life of children, and was the only real  reformer in the France of his time.    Now it is not because Saint Vincent was for a time the preceptor of  Cardinal de Retz that I find the Cardinal so delightful! On the  contrary! I enjoy the Cardinal, famous coadjutor of his uncle, the  Archbishop of Paris, because he is a true type of the polite, the  worldly, and the intriguing gentleman of his time. He died a good  peaceful death, as all the gay and the gallant did at his time. He  earned the deepest affection and respect of Madame de S['e]vign['e], for  which any discerning man might have been willing to spend half a  lifetime. But even that is beside the point. He lives for me because he  gives a picture of the French ruling classes of his time which is  shamelessly true. No living man to-day in political office, although he  might be as great an intriguer as the Cardinal, would dare to be so  interestingly shameless. That is a great charm in itself. And, then, if  you read him in French, you discover that he knew how to make  literature.    The only wonder in my mind has always been how a man who became so  penitent during the last years of his life as Paul de Gondi should not  have been forced by his confessor to destroy his book of revelations.  But one must remember that the confessors of his period--the period of  the founding of the French Academy--had a great respect for mere  literature. His father was Philip Emanuel de Gondi, Count de Joigni,  General of the Gallies of France, and Knight of the Order of the Holy  Ghost; who retired in the year 1640, to live among the Fathers of the  Oratory. There he entered into holy orders, and there he died, with the  reputation of a mightily pious man, on June 29, 1662, aged eighty-one.         Give me leave, madame [Cardinal de Retz says] to reflect a little       here upon the nature of the mind of man. I believe that there was       not in the world a man of an uprighter heart than my father, and I       may say that he was stampt in the very mold of virtue. Yet my duels       and love-intrigues did not hinder the good man from doing all he       could to tye to the Church, the soul in the world perhaps the least       ecclesiastical. His predilection for his eldest son, and the view       of the archbishoprick of Paris for me, were the true causes of his       acting thus; though he neither believed it, nor felt it. I dare say       that he thought, nay would have sworn, that he was led in all this       by no other motive than the spiritual good of my soul, and the fear       of the danger to which it might be exposed in another profession.       So true it is that nothing is more subject to delusion than piety.       All manner of errors creep and hide themselves under that vail.       Piety takes for sacred all her imaginations, of what sort soever;       but the best intention in the world is not enough to keep it in       that respect free from irregularity. In fine, after all that I have       related I remained a churchman; but certainly I had not long       continued so, if an accident had not happened which I am now to       acquaint you with.    This is not at all what is called \"edifying,\" but, from the moral point  of view, it shows what Saint Vincent de Paul had to struggle against in  the Church of France; and the position of Paul de Gondi in relation to  an established church was just as common in contemporary England, where  \"livings\" were matters of barter and sale but where the methods of the  clergymen highly placed were neither so intellectual nor so romantic.    It must be admitted that Cardinal de Retz, like a later French prelate,  Talleyrand, made no pretense of being fitted for the Church.  Talleyrand's only qualification was that he was lame; and, as a younger  son, he had to be provided for. But Cardinal de Retz, with all his  faults, had a saving grace in spite of many unsaving graces. He did his  best to escape the priesthood. He fought his first duel with  Bassompierre behind the Convent of the Minims, in the Bois de  Vincennes; but it was of no use. His friends stopped the inquiry of the  Attorney General, \"and so I remained in my cassock notwithstanding my  duel.\" His next duel was with Praslin. He tried his best to give it the  utmost publicity, but, he says, \"there's no use in opposing one's  destiny; nobody took the slightest notice of the scandal.\"    The elder Dumas has probably had his day, though \"Monte Cristo\" and \"The  Three Musketeers\" are still read. The newer romance writers are less  diffuse, and, not writing _feuilletons_, are not forced to be diffuse.  The constant reader of French memoirs of the seventeenth century can  hardly help wondering why anybody should read Dumas who could go  directly to the sources of his romances.    Speaking of the relation of books to books, it was the \"Memoirs\" of  Madame Campan that took me into the society of Benjamin Franklin. There  were legends about him in Philadelphia, where we thought we knew more  about this distinguished American than anybody else; but it was through  certain passages in the \"Memoirs on Marie Antoinette and her Court\" that  I turned to his autobiography, and then to such letters of his as could  be found. That autobiography is one of the gems of American history,  though it does not reveal the whole man. If he had been as frank as  Cardinal de Retz, his autobiography would have been suppressed; but,  then, no Philadelphian could ever be quite frank in his memoirs. It has  never been done! Even the seemingly reckless James Huneker understood  that thoroughly. But the autobiography of Benjamin Franklin is  sufficiently frank. It is of its own time, and it seems to me that it  should be read just after one has finished for the second or third time  the memoirs of Gouverneur Morris. Everybody feels it his duty to acclaim  the charm of the confessions of Benvenuto Cellini, and I have known a  young woman who read them reverently in the holy service of culture as a  pendant to a textbook on the Renascence, and followed him by Jowett's  translation of the \"Republic of Plato.\" She may safely be left to her  fate. The diaries of Gouverneur Morris were not in her course of  reading, and they seem almost to have been forgotten. I do not recommend  them to anybody. There are passages in them which might shock the  Prohibitionist, and also those persons who believe in divorce _[`a] la  mode de_ Madame de Sta[:e]l.    For me, they are not only constantly amusing, constantly instructive,  but they give the best pictures of Parisian interiors of the time before  and during the French Revolution. Because I am firmly convinced of this,  is it necessary that I should be expected to place them among the Best  One Hundred Books?

I'm  monitress here, and I don't intend to have this kind of thing going on  at St. Chad's.\"    \"What's the matter?\" asked Honor, rubbing her eyes.    \"Matter, indeed! You know as well as I do. It was a cruel, mean trick  to play upon a nervous, delicate girl like Evie Fletcher.\"    Honor was considerably astonished. She, of course, knew nothing of  Flossie's escapade, and imagined that the monitress must be referring  to the few words she had said on the upper landing.    \"Why, Evie didn't seem to mind all that much!\" she retorted.    \"You've frightened her most seriously, and I consider it so dangerous  that I'd rather you were expelled from the school than that it should  happen again. I don't want to get you into trouble at head-quarters if  I can help it, so I'll say nothing if you'll promise me faithfully that  this is absolutely the last time you'll ever act ghost.\"    \"Of course I'll promise. I didn't intend to upset Evie. I think both  you and she are making a great fuss about nothing,\" replied Honor,  lying down once more.    \"I'm disgusted with you, Honor Fitzgerald! If you can't realize the  mischief your thoughtlessness has done, you might at least have the  grace to be sorry for it! To amuse yourself by playing on the fears of  a timid girl, younger than you, is the work of a coward--yes, a coward!  That's what I consider you!\" and Vivian turned away, full of righteous  wrath, and wondering whether she had adequately fulfilled her  monitorial duty, or whether she ought to have said even more.          CHAPTER IX    Diamond cut Diamond      Honor was both amazed and indignant at Vivian's stern rebuke. She  appealed to Janie in self-justification.    \"I don't understand it,\" she declared. \"I only screwed up my face, and  said ghosts glided. I stopped at once when Vivian asked me. How could  Evelyn have been so fearfully frightened just at that?\"    \"I can't imagine,\" said Janie, \"except that she's such an extremely  nervous girl.\"    \"It's too bad to blame me on that account.\"    \"Vivian is generally very severe.\"    \"She's always down on me! I'm continually in hot water, and half the  time I don't know exactly why.\"    It was not until the next afternoon that Honor learnt of the practical  joke that had been practised upon her schoolfellow. As she was washing  her hands in the dressing-room she chanced to overhear a few remarks  between two or three girls who were discussing the affair, and at once  questioned them about it.    \"Of course Meta knew it was you, Honor!\" said Ruth Latimer, rather  reproachfully.    \"Why of course?\" asked Honor.    \"Because it couldn't be anyone else. You're always playing tricks upon  someone.\"    \"It's a case of 'give a dog a bad name', then. I'm innocent for once.\"    \"But the ghost ran up the steps to No. 8!\"    \"That's only 'circumstantial evidence'. I certainly didn't do it. Janie  can tell you that I never left the bedroom.\"    \"Yes, I could take my oath in a law court, as a reliable witness,\"  vouched Janie.    \"Then who was it?\"    Honor shook her head.    \"Ask me a harder!\" she said briefly.    Flossie, who was standing near, looked rather conscious, but  volunteered no explanation.    \"It's a most peculiar thing,\" said Ruth. \"Somebody must have been the  ghost, I suppose.\"    \"Unless it were a real one!\" suggested Flossie. \"It might----\"    \"What nonsense! Nobody believes in ghosts, except, perhaps, Evelyn,\"  interrupted Ruth scornfully. \"Of course, it was a girl playing a trick.  The only question is, who?\"    \"Could it be May or Trissie Turner?\" suggested Flossie.    \"Impossible! Evelyn's own cousins--and in the Sixth Form, too!\"    \"It's very extraordinary!\"    \"It ought to be properly cleared up,\" said Lettice Talbot.    \"Suppose we ask every girl in the house if she knows anything,\"  proposed Dorothy Arkwright.    \"No; Meta begged us to let the matter drop,\" replied Ruth. \"She says  Evelyn is extremely sensitive about it, and can't bear the subject  alluded to.\"    \"Evelyn looked very ill this morning,\" observed Dorothy.    \"Yes; Meta says she has had a severe shock, and the least reference to  it might upset her again.\"    \"So it will have to remain unexplained?\"    \"I suppose so,\" said Flossie. \"It seems a complete mystery.\"    \"Why, Flossie!\" exclaimed Maisie Talbot suddenly, \"didn't I hear you  get up last night, after Vivian had gone downstairs and we had marched  off to bed again? I remember I called out to you, but I was too sleepy  to wake up properly. I verily believe it must have been you who  frightened Evelyn. Honestly now, was it?\"    Flossie turned very red. She would have continued to shield herself at  Honor's expense if it had been any longer possible, but she was not  prepared to tell a direct falsehood. There was no way out of it but to  confess.    \"What a storm in a teacup!\" she replied, shrugging her shoulders. \"It's  absurd if one can't play the least joke without a monitress interfering  and making a ridiculous fuss. It was only meant for fun; I should have  laughed if anybody had done it to me.\"    \"It's no laughing matter,\" said Maisie gravely. \"In the first place,  though Evelyn may be silly, you had no right to frighten her; and in  the second place, you deliberately let the blame rest on Honor's  shoulders.\"    \"Vivian ought to be told of this,\" declared Dorothy.    \"Yes, she must know at once,\" added Ruth.    \"Oh, please don't go sneaking to the monitress on my account!\"  interposed Honor. \"If Meta wants the affair to drop, it shall. Both she  and Vivian took it for granted last night that I had acted the ghost in  No. 4; they never asked me, or gave me a chance of denying it, so I  shan't trouble to undeceive them. If Vivian has such a poor opinion of  me already, she shan't think me a tell-tale in addition. As for  Flossie, she's not worth noticing.\"    \"But telling a monitress isn't like telling a teacher,\" objected Ruth.    \"It savours of sneaking, and I prefer to leave it alone. What does it  matter? I don't care about anybody's opinion!\"    Honor was on her high horse. She had been much hurt by Vivian's  injustice, and all the Fitzgerald pride was roused within her.  Notwithstanding the girls' remonstrances, she would not allow herself  to be cleared of the false charge.    \"The whole thing is altogether beneath me,\" she remarked, as she  stalked haughtily away.    \"It's no good trying to persuade her,\" said Lettice. \"When she puts  that set look on her face, arguments are absolutely useless.\"    \"On the whole, I think I rather admire her for saying nothing,\"  commented Maisie. \"It's more dignified than making a fuss. I can't  tolerate tale-bearing myself. It would have got Flossie into a terrific  scrape with Vivian, and probably with Miss Maitland as well.\"    \"Flossie doesn't deserve to go scot-free,\" said Ruth, with a glance at  the flaxen head that was discreetly disappearing through the door.    \"She won't!\" asserted Lettice. \"Honor is the most contrary, queer,  impossible, perverse girl I've ever met. She'll let Flossie off easily  now, but she'll make her pay for it in some other way. I could see it  in her eye. She was as cool as a cucumber outside, but I'm sure that  was only the crust over the crater, and that there was the usual  volcano inside. It's bound to find a safety-valve, so Flossie had  better look out for squalls!\"    Lettice was right. Honor was certainly in a most unenviable frame of  mind. She considered that Vivian had treated her unfairly in assuming  her to be guilty without making any proper investigation.    \"It's the first time a Fitzgerald has ever been called a coward!\" she  said to Janie.    The word rankled in her memory even more than the monitress's  high-handed manner.    \"Then you must use every opportunity of showing that you're the  reverse,\" replied Janie. \"You'll have to live the thing down. I expect  the truth will come round to Vivian's ears in course of time, and I'm  sure that she'll think far better of you than if we had gone at once to  her with a long accusation against Flossie. If Flossie herself had  offered to tell, that would have been different; but she didn't rise to  such a pitch of heroism.\"    \"One wouldn't expect it from Flossie Taylor!\" said Honor  contemptuously, as she hurried off to her music lesson.    I am afraid Honor's scales that day were anything but a satisfaction to  Fraeulein Bernhardt, the piano teacher. Her mind was so abstracted that  she kept continually playing wrong fingering, or even an occasional  wrong note in the harmonic minors. Her study was little better, and her  piece a dead failure. The mistress, with characteristic German  patience, set her to work to try to conquer a couple of difficult  phrases, through which Honor stumbled again and again, each time with  the same old mistakes, until the end of the half-hour.    \"I find you not yet fit to take share in ze evening pairformance!\"  sighed poor Fraeulein, whose musical ear had been much distressed by  this mangling of her favourite tarantella. \"Zere must be more of  improvement before ve render ze piece to Mees Maitland. You say you not  vish to play in publique? Ach, so! Zat is vat zey all say; but it is  good to begin young to get over ze fear--vat you call ze 'shyness'--is  it not so?\"    Fraeulein Bernhardt was an excellent teacher--patient, conscientious,  and enthusiastic. She tried to inspire all her pupils with her own love  for music, and with some indeed she succeeded, though with others it  proved a more difficult task.    \"I'm almost impossible!\" avowed Lettice Talbot. \"I believe I'm nearly  as bad as the old fellow who declared he only knew two tunes--one was  'God Save the King', and the other wasn't.\"    \"You certainly have a particularly leaden touch,\" agreed Dorothy  Arkwright. \"The way you hammer out Mendelssohn is enough to try my  nerves, so I'm sure it must be an offence to Fraeulein.\"    \"I"]]]
