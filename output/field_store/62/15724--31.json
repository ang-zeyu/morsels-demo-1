The place could not be better for my birdlets;  shallow, tepid water, interspersed with muddy knolls and green eyots.  The diversions of the bath begin forthwith. The ducklings clap their  beaks and rummage here, there and everywhere; they sift each mouthful,  rejecting the clear water and retaining the good bits. In the deeper  parts, they point their sterns into the air and stick their heads under  water. They are happy; and it is a blessed thing to see them at work. We  will let them be. It is my turn to enjoy the pond.    What is this? On the mud lie some loose, knotted, soot-colored cords.  One could take them for threads of wool like those which you pull out of  an old ravelly stocking. Can some shepherdess, knitting a black sock and  finding her work turn out badly, have begun all over again and, in her  impatience, have thrown down the wool with all the dropped stitches? It  really looks like it.    I take up one of those cords in my hand. It is sticky and extremely  slack; the thing slips through the fingers before they can catch hold of  it. A few of the knots burst and shed their contents. What comes out is  a black globule, the size of a pin's head, followed by a flat tail. I  recognize, on a very small scale, a familiar object: the tadpole, the  frog's baby. I have seen enough. Let us leave the knotted cords alone.    The next creatures please me better. They spin round on the surface of  the water and their black backs gleam in the sun. If I lift a hand to  seize them, that moment they disappear, I know not where. It's a pity: I  should have much liked to see them closer and to make them wriggle in a  little bowl which I should have put ready for them.    Let us look at the bottom of the water, pulling aside those bunches of  green string whence beads of air are rising and gathering into foam.  There is something of everything underneath. I see pretty shells with  compact whorls, flat as beans; I notice little worms carrying tufts and  feathers; I make out some with flabby fins constantly flapping on their  backs. What are they all doing there? What are their names? I do not  know. And I stare at them for ever so long, held by the incomprehensible  mystery of the waters.    At the place where the pond dribbles into the adjoining field are some  alder trees; and here I make a glorious find. It is a scarab--not a  very large one, oh no! He is smaller than a cherry-stone, but of an  unutterable blue. The angels in paradise must wear dresses of that  color. I put the glorious one inside an empty snail-shell, which I plug  up with a leaf. I shall admire that living jewel at my leisure, when I  get back. Other distractions summon me away.    The spring that feeds the pond trickles from the rock, cold and clear.  The water first collects into a cup, the size of the hollow of one's two  hands, and then runs over in a stream. These falls call for a mill: that  goes without saying. Two bits of straw, artistically crossed upon  an axis, provide the machinery; some flat stones set on edge afford  supports. It is a great success: the mill turns admirably. My triumph  would be complete, could I but share it. For want of other playmates, I  invite the ducks.    Everything palls in this poor world of ours, even a mill made of two  straws. Let us think of something else: let us contrive a dam to hold  back the waters and form a pool. There is no lack of stones for the  brickwork. I pick the most suitable; I break the larger ones. And, while  collecting these blocks, suddenly I forget all about the dam which I  meant to build.    On one of the broken stones, in a cavity large enough for me to put my  fist in, something gleams like glass. The hollow is lined with facets  gathered in sixes which flash and glitter in the sun. I have seen  something like this in church, on the great saints' days, when the light  of the candles in the big chandelier kindles the stars in its hanging  crystal.    We children, lying, in summer, on the straw of the threshing floor,  have told one another stories of the treasures which a dragon guards  underground. Those treasures now return to my mind: the names of  precious stones ring out uncertainly but gloriously in my memory. I  think of the king's crown, of the princesses' necklaces. In breaking  stones, can I have found, but on a much richer scale, the thing that  shines quite small in my mother's ring? I want more such.    The dragon of the subterranean treasures treats me generously. He gives  me his diamonds in such quantities that soon I possess a heap of broken  stones sparkling with magnificent clusters. He does more: he gives me  his gold. The trickle of water from the rock falls on a bed of fine sand  which it swirls into bubbles. If I bent over towards the light, I see  something like gold filings whirling where the fall touches the bottom.  Is it really the famous metal of which twenty-franc pieces, so rare with  us at home, are made? One would think so, from the glitter.    I take a pinch of sand and place it in my palm. The brilliant particles  are numerous, but so small that I have to pick them up with a straw  moistened in my mouth. Let us drop this: they are too tiny and too  bothersome to collect. The big, valuable lumps must be farther on,  in the thickness of the rock. We'll come back later; we'll blast the  mountain.    I break more stones. Oh, what a queer thing has just come loose, all in  one piece! It is turned spiral-wise, like certain flat snails that come  out of the cracks of old walls in rainy weather. With its gnarled sides,  it looks like a little ram's horn. Shell or horn, it is very curious.  How do things like that find their way into the stone?    Treasures and curiosities make my pockets bulge with pebbles. It is  late and the little ducklings have had all they want to eat. Come  along, youngsters, let's go home. My blistered heel is forgotten in  my excitement. The walk back is a delight. A voice sings in my ear,  an untranslatable voice, softer than any language and bewildering as a  dream. It speaks to me for the first time of the mysteries of the pond;  it glorifies the heavenly insect which I hear moving in the empty snail  shell, its temporary cage; it whispers the secrets of the rock, the gold  filings, the faceted jewels, the ram's horn turned to stone.    Poor simpleton, smother your joy! I arrive. My parents catch sight of  my bulging pockets, with their disgraceful load of stones. The cloth has  given way under the rough and heavy burden.    \"You rascal!\" says father, at sight of the damage. \"I send you to mind  the ducks and you amuse yourself picking up stones, as though there  weren't enough of them all round the house! Make haste and throw them  away!\"    Broken hearted, I obey. Diamonds, gold dust, petrified ram's horn,  heavenly beetle are all flung on a rubbish heap outside the door.    Mother bewails her lot: \"A nice thing, bringing up children to see them  turn out so badly! You'll bring me to my grave. Green stuff I don't  mind: it does for the rabbits. But stones, which ruin your pockets;  poisonous animals, which'll sting your hand: what good are they to you,  silly? There's no doubt about it: some one has thrown a spell over you!\"    Yes, my poor mother, you were right, in your simplicity: a spell had  been cast upon me; I admit it today. When it is hard enough to earn  one's bit of bread, does not improving one's mind but render one more  meet for suffering? Of what avail is the torment of learning to the  derelicts of life?    A deal better off am I, at this late hour, dogged by poverty and knowing  that the diamonds of the duck pool were rock crystal, the gold dust  mica, the stone horn an Ammonite and the sky-blue beetle a Hoplia! We  poor men would do better to mistrust the joys of knowledge: let us dig  our furrow in the fields of the commonplace, flee the temptations of the  pond, mind our ducks and leave to others, more favored by fortune, the  job of explaining the world's mechanism, if the spirit moves them.    And yet no! Alone among living creatures, man has the thirst for  knowledge; he alone pries into the mysteries of things. The least among  us will utter his whys and his wherefores, a fine pain unknown to  the brute beast. If these questionings come from us with greater  persistence, with a more imperious authority, if they divert us from  the quest of lucre, life's only object in the eyes of most men, does it  become us to complain? Let us be careful not to do so, for that would be  denying the best of all our gifts.    Let us strive, on the contrary, within the measure of our capacity,  to force a gleam of light from the vast unknown; let us examine and  question and, here and there, wrest a few shreds of truth. We shall sink  under the task; in the present ill ordered state of society, we shall  end, perhaps, in the workhouse. Let us go ahead for all that: our  consolation shall be that we have increased by one atom the general mass  of knowledge, the incomparable treasure of mankind.    As this modest lot has fallen to me, I will return to the pond,  notwithstanding the wise admonitions and the bitter tears which I once  owed to it. I will return to the pond, but not to that of the small  ducks, the pond aflower with illusions: those ponds do not occur twice  in a lifetime. For luck like that, you must be in all the new glory of  your first breeches and your first ideas.    Many another have I come upon since that distant time, ponds very much  richer and, moreover, explored with the ripened eye of experience.  Enthusiastically I searched them with the net, stirred up their mud,  ransacked their trailing weeds. None in my memories comes up to the  first, magnified in its delights and mortifications by the marvelous  perspective of the years.    Nor would any of them suit my plans of today. Their world is too vast. I  should lose myself in their immensities, where life swarms freely in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3424"],[0,"For the Term of His Natural Life (#20)"],[1," and the gaol. The hospital was  on the west shore, and in a line with it lay the two penitentiaries.  Lines of lofty palisades ran round the settlement, giving it the  appearance of a fortified town. These palisades were built for the  purpose of warding off the terrific blasts of wind, which, shrieking  through the long and narrow bay as through the keyhole of a door, had in  former times tore off roofs and levelled boat-sheds. The little town  was set, as it were, in defiance of Nature, at the very extreme of  civilization, and its inhabitants maintained perpetual warfare with the  winds and waves.    But the gaol of Sarah Island was not the only prison in this desolate  region.    At a little distance from the mainland is a rock, over the rude side  of which the waves dash in rough weather. On the evening of the 3rd  December, 1833, as the sun was sinking behind the tree-tops on the left  side of the harbour, the figure of a man appeared on the top of this  rock. He was clad in the coarse garb of a convict, and wore round his  ankles two iron rings, connected by a short and heavy chain. To the  middle of this chain a leathern strap was attached, which, splitting  in the form of a T, buckled round his waist, and pulled the chain high  enough to prevent him from stumbling over it as he walked. His head was  bare, and his coarse, blue-striped shirt, open at the throat, displayed  an embrowned and muscular neck. Emerging from out a sort of cell, or  den, contrived by nature or art in the side of the cliff, he threw on  a scanty fire, which burned between two hollowed rocks, a small log of  pine wood, and then returning to his cave, and bringing from it an iron  pot, which contained water, he scooped with his toil-hardened hands a  resting-place for it in the ashes, and placed it on the embers. It was  evident that the cave was at once his storehouse and larder, and that  the two hollowed rocks formed his kitchen.    Having thus made preparations for supper, he ascended a pathway which  led to the highest point of the rock. His fetters compelled him to take  short steps, and, as he walked, he winced as though the iron bit him.  A handkerchief or strip of cloth was twisted round his left ankle; on  which the circlet had chafed a sore. Painfully and slowly, he gained his  destination, and flinging himself on the ground, gazed around him. The  afternoon had been stormy, and the rays of the setting sun shone redly  on the turbid and rushing waters of the bay. On the right lay Sarah  Island; on the left the bleak shore of the opposite and the tall peak of  the Frenchman's Cap; while the storm hung sullenly over the barren hills  to the eastward. Below him appeared the only sign of life. A brig was  being towed up the harbour by two convict-manned boats.    The sight of this brig seemed to rouse in the mind of the solitary of  the rock a strain of reflection, for, sinking his chin upon his hand,  he fixed his eyes on the incoming vessel, and immersed himself in moody  thought. More than an hour had passed, yet he did not move. The ship  anchored, the boats detached themselves from her sides, the sun sank,  and the bay was plunged in gloom. Lights began to twinkle along the  shore of the settlement. The little fire died, and the water in the iron  pot grew cold; yet the watcher on the rock did not stir. With his eyes  staring into the gloom, and fixed steadily on the vessel, he lay along  the barren cliff of his lonely prison as motionless as the rock on which  he had stretched himself.    This solitary man was Rufus Dawes.          CHAPTER III. A SOCIAL EVENING.        In the house of Major Vickers, Commandant of Macquarie Harbour, there  was, on this evening of December 3rd, unusual gaiety.    Lieutenant Maurice Frere, late in command at Maria Island, had  unexpectedly come down with news from head-quarters. The Ladybird,  Government schooner, visited the settlement on ordinary occasions twice  a year, and such visits were looked forward to with no little eagerness  by the settlers. To the convicts the arrival of the Ladybird meant  arrival of new faces, intelligence of old comrades, news of how the  world, from which they were exiled, was progressing. When the Ladybird  arrived, the chained and toil-worn felons felt that they were yet human,  that the universe was not bounded by the gloomy forests which surrounded  their prison, but that there was a world beyond, where men, like  themselves, smoked, and drank, and laughed, and rested, and were Free.  When the Ladybird arrived, they heard such news as interested them--that  is to say, not mere foolish accounts of wars or ship arrivals, or city  gossip, but matters appertaining to their own world--how Tom was with  the road gangs, Dick on a ticket-of-leave, Harry taken to the bush, and  Jack hung at the Hobart Town Gaol. Such items of intelligence were the  only news they cared to hear, and the new-comers were well posted up in  such matters. To the convicts the Ladybird was town talk, theatre,  stock quotations, and latest telegrams. She was their newspaper and  post-office, the one excitement of their dreary existence, the one link  between their own misery and the happiness of their fellow-creatures. To  the Commandant and the \"free men\" this messenger from the outer life  was scarcely less welcome. There was not a man on the island who did not  feel his heart grow heavier when her white sails disappeared behind the  shoulder of the hill.    On the present occasion business of more than ordinary importance had  procured for Major Vickers this pleasurable excitement. It had been  resolved by Governor Arthur that the convict establishment should be  broken up. A succession of murders and attempted escapes had called  public attention to the place, and its distance from Hobart Town  rendered it inconvenient and expensive. Arthur had fixed upon Tasman's  Peninsula--the earring of which we have spoken--as a future convict  depot, and naming it Port Arthur, in honour of himself, had sent down  Lieutenant Maurice Frere with instructions for Vickers to convey the  prisoners of Macquarie Harbour thither.    In order to understand the magnitude and meaning of such an order as  that with which Lieutenant Frere was entrusted, we must glance at the  social condition of the penal colony at this period of its history.    Nine years before, Colonel Arthur, late Governor of Honduras, had  arrived at a most critical moment. The former Governor, Colonel Sorrell,  was a man of genial temperament, but little strength of character. He  was, moreover, profligate in his private life; and, encouraged by his  example, his officers violated all rules of social decency. It was  common for an officer to openly keep a female convict as his mistress.  Not only would compliance purchase comforts, but strange stories were  afloat concerning the persecution of women who dared to choose their own  lovers. To put down this profligacy was the first care of Arthur; and in  enforcing a severe attention to etiquette and outward respectability, he  perhaps erred on the side of virtue. Honest, brave, and high-minded,  he was also penurious and cold, and the ostentatious good humour of  the colonists dashed itself in vain against his polite indifference. In  opposition to this official society created by Governor Arthur was that  of the free settlers and the ticket-of-leave men. The latter were more  numerous than one would be apt to suppose. On the 2nd November, 1829,  thirty-eight free pardons and fifty-six conditional pardons appeared on  the books; and the number of persons holding tickets-of-leave, on the  26th of September the same year, was seven hundred and forty-five.    Of the social condition of these people at this time it is impossible to  speak without astonishment. According to the recorded testimony of many  respectable persons-Government officials, military officers, and free  settlers-the profligacy of the settlers was notorious. Drunkenness was  a prevailing vice. Even children were to be seen in the streets  intoxicated. On Sundays, men and women might be observed standing round  the public-house doors, waiting for the expiration of the hours of  public worship, in order to continue their carousing. As for the  condition of the prisoner population, that, indeed, is indescribable.  Notwithstanding the severe punishment for sly grog-selling, it was  carried on to a large extent. Men and women were found intoxicated  together, and a bottle of brandy was considered to be cheaply bought at  the price of twenty lashes. In the factory--a prison for females--the  vilest abuses were committed, while the infamies current, as matters  of course, in chain gangs and penal settlements, were of too horrible  a nature to be more than hinted at here. All that the vilest and most  bestial of human creatures could invent and practise, was in this  unhappy country invented and practised without restraint and without  shame.    Seven classes of criminals were established in 1826, when the new  barracks for prisoners at Hobart Town were finished. The first class  were allowed to sleep out of barracks, and to work for themselves on  Saturday; the second had only the last-named indulgence; the third were  only allowed Saturday afternoon; the fourth and fifth were \"refractory  and disorderly characters--to work in irons;\" the sixth were \"men of  the most degraded and incorrigible character--to be worked in irons, and  kept entirely separate from the other prisoners;\" while the seventh were  the refuse of this refuse--the murderers, bandits, and villains, whom  neither chain nor lash could tame. They were regarded as socially dead,  and shipped to Hell's Gates, or Maria Island. Hells Gates was the most  dreaded of all these houses of bondage. The discipline at the place was  so severe, and the life so terrible, that prisoners would risk all to  escape from it. In one year, of eighty-five deaths there,"]]]
