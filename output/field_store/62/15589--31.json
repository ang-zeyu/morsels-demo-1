And why all these doubts and delays? Because we know not what is  behind--because there is no returning--and because our mind infers that  all is darkness and confusion, where we have nothing but uncertainty.\"    His appearance at length became quite altered by the effect of his  melancholy thoughts; and his resolution was now finally and irrevocably  taken, of which the following ambiguous letter, which he addressed to  his friend, may appear to afford some proof.    DECEMBER 20.    I am grateful to your love, Wilhelm, for having repeated your advice so  seasonably. Yes, you are right: it is undoubtedly better that I should  depart. But I do not entirely approve your scheme of returning at  once to your neighbourhood; at least, I should like to make a little  excursion on the way, particularly as we may now expect a continued  frost, and consequently good roads. I am much pleased with your  intention of coming to fetch me; only delay your journey for a  fortnight, and wait for another letter from me. One should gather  nothing before it is ripe, and a fortnight sooner or later makes a great  difference. Entreat my mother to pray for her son, and tell her I beg  her pardon for all the unhappiness I have occasioned her. It has  ever been my fate to give pain to those whose happiness I should have  promoted. Adieu, my dearest friend. May every blessing of Heaven attend  you! Farewell.    We find it difficult to express the emotions with which Charlotte's soul  was agitated during the whole of this time, whether in relation to her  husband or to her unfortunate friend; although we are enabled, by our  knowledge of her character, to understand their nature.    It is certain that she had formed a determination, by every means in  her power to keep Werther at a distance; and, if she hesitated in her  decision, it was from a sincere feeling of friendly pity, knowing how  much it would cost him, indeed, that he would find it almost impossible  to comply with her wishes. But various causes now urged her to be firm.  Her husband preserved a strict silence about the whole matter; and she  never made it a subject of conversation, feeling bound to prove to him  by her conduct that her sentiments agreed with his.    The same day, which was the Sunday before Christmas, after Werther had  written the last-mentioned letter to his friend, he came in the evening  to Charlotte's house, and found her alone. She was busy preparing some  little gifts for her brothers and sisters, which were to be distributed  to them on Christmas Day. He began talking of the delight of  the children, and of that age when the sudden appearance of the  Christmas-tree, decorated with fruit and sweetmeats, and lighted up with  wax candles, causes such transports of joy. \"You shall have a gift too,  if you behave well,\" said Charlotte, hiding her embarrassment under  sweet smile. \"And what do you call behaving well? What should I do, what  can I do, my dear Charlotte?\" said he. \"Thursday night,\" she answered,  \"is Christmas Eve. The children are all to be here, and my father too:  there is a present for each; do you come likewise, but do not come  before that time.\" Werther started. \"I desire you will not: it must be  so,\" she continued. \"I ask it of you as a favour, for my own peace and  tranquillity. We cannot go on in this manner any longer.\" He turned away  his face walked hastily up and down the room, muttering indistinctly,  \"We cannot go on in this manner any longer!\" Charlotte, seeing the  violent agitation into which these words had thrown him, endeavoured  to divert his thoughts by different questions, but in vain. \"No,  Charlotte!\" he exclaimed; \"I will never see you any more!\" \"And why so?\"  she answered. \"We may--we must see each other again; only let it be  with more discretion. Oh! why were you born with that excessive, that  ungovernable passion for everything that is dear to you?\" Then, taking  his hand, she said, \"I entreat of you to be more calm: your talents,  your understanding, your genius, will furnish you with a thousand  resources. Be a man, and conquer an unhappy attachment toward a creature  who can do nothing but pity you.\" He bit his lips, and looked at her  with a gloomy countenance. She continued to hold his hand. \"Grant me but  a moment's patience, Werther,\" she said. \"Do you not see that you are  deceiving yourself, that you are seeking your own destruction? Why must  you love me, me only, who belong to another? I fear, I much fear, that  it is only the impossibility of possessing me which makes your desire  for me so strong.\" He drew back his hand, whilst he surveyed her with a  wild and angry look. \"'Tis well!\" he exclaimed, \"'tis very well! Did not  Albert furnish you with this reflection? It is profound, a very profound  remark.\" \"A reflection that any one might easily make,\" she answered;  \"and is there not a woman in the whole world who is at liberty, and has  the power to make you happy? Conquer yourself: look for such a being,  and believe me when I say that you will certainly find her. I have long  felt for you, and for us all: you have confined yourself too long within  the limits of too narrow a circle. Conquer yourself; make an effort: a  short journey will be of service to you. Seek and find an object worthy  of your love; then return hither, and let us enjoy together all the  happiness of the most perfect friendship.\"    \"This speech,\" replied Werther with a cold smile, \"this speech should  be printed, for the benefit of all teachers. My dear Charlotte, allow me  but a short time longer, and all will be well.\" \"But however, Werther,\"  she added, \"do not come again before Christmas.\" He was about to make  some answer, when Albert came in. They saluted each other coldly, and  with mutual embarrassment paced up and down the room. Werther made  some common remarks; Albert did the same, and their conversation soon  dropped. Albert asked his wife about some household matters; and,  finding that his commissions were not executed, he used some expressions  which, to Werther's ear, savoured of extreme harshness. He wished to go,  but had not power to move; and in this situation he remained till eight  o'clock, his uneasiness and discontent continually increasing. At length  the cloth was laid for supper, and he took up his hat and stick. Albert  invited him to remain; but Werther, fancying that he was merely paying a  formal compliment, thanked him coldly, and left the house.    Werther returned home, took the candle from his servant, and retired  to his room alone. He talked for some time with great earnestness to  himself, wept aloud, walked in a state of great excitement through his  chamber; till at length, without undressing, he threw himself on the  bed, where he was found by his servant at eleven o'clock, when the  latter ventured to enter the room, and take off his boots. Werther did  not prevent him, but forbade him to come in the morning till he should  ring.    On Monday morning, the 21st of December, he wrote to Charlotte the  following letter, which was found, sealed, on his bureau after his  death, and was given to her. I shall insert it in fragments; as it  appears, from several circumstances, to have been written in that  manner.    \"It is all over, Charlotte: I am resolved to die! I make this  declaration deliberately and coolly, without any romantic passion, on  this morning of the day when I am to see you for the last time. At the  moment you read these lines, O best of women, the cold grave will hold  the inanimate remains of that restless and unhappy being who, in the  last moments of his existence, knew no pleasure so great as that of  conversing with you! I have passed a dreadful night or rather, let me  say, a propitious one; for it has given me resolution, it has fixed my  purpose. I am resolved to die. When I tore myself from you yesterday,  my senses were in tumult and disorder; my heart was oppressed, hope and  pleasure had fled from me for ever, and a petrifying cold had seized  my wretched being. I could scarcely reach my room. I threw myself on  my knees; and Heaven, for the last time, granted me the consolation of  shedding tears. A thousand ideas, a thousand schemes, arose within my  soul; till at length one last, fixed, final thought took possession of  my heart. It was to die. I lay down to rest; and in the morning, in the  quiet hour of awakening, the same determination was upon me. To die! It  is not despair: it is conviction that I have filled up the measure of  my sufferings, that I have reached my appointed term, and must sacrifice  myself for thee. Yes, Charlotte, why should I not avow it? One of us  three must die: it shall be Werther. O beloved Charlotte! this heart,  excited by rage and fury, has often conceived the horrid idea of  murdering your husband--you--myself! The lot is cast at length. And in  the bright, quiet evenings of summer, when you sometimes wander toward  the mountains, let your thoughts then turn to me: recollect how often  you have watched me coming to meet you from the valley; then bend your  eyes upon the churchyard which contains my grave, and, by the light of  the setting sun, mark how the evening breeze waves the tall grass  which grows above my tomb. I was calm when I began this letter, but the  recollection of these scenes makes me weep like a child.\"    About ten in the morning, Werther called his servant, and, whilst he  was dressing, told him that in a few days he intended to set out upon  a journey, and bade him therefore lay his clothes in order, and prepare  them for packing up, call in all his accounts, fetch home the books  he had lent, and give two months' pay to the poor dependants who were  accustomed to receive from him a weekly allowance.    He breakfasted"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25282"],[0,"The Jewish State (#20)"],[1," possess any but  moral authority, this authority will suffice to establish the credit  of the Jewish Company in the nation's eyes. The Jewish Company will be  unable to succeed in its enterprise unless it has received the  Society's sanction; it will thus not be formed of any mere  indiscriminate group of financiers. For the Society will weigh, select  and decide, and will not give its approbation till it is sure of the  existence of a sound basis for the conscientious carrying out of the  scheme. It will not permit experiments with insufficient means, for  this undertaking must succeed at the first attempt. Any initial  failure would compromise the whole idea for many decades to come, or  might even make its realization permanently impossible.    The three methods of raising capital are: (1) Through big banks; (2)  Through small and private banks; (3) Through public subscription.    The first method of raising capital is: Through big banks. The  required sum could then be raised in the shortest possible time among  the large financial groups, after they had discussed the advisability  of the course. The great advantage of this method would be that it  would avoid the necessity of paying in the thousand millions (to keep  to the original figure), immediately in its entirety. A further  advantage would be that the credit of these powerful financiers would  also be of service to the enterprise. Many latent political forces lie  in our financial power, that power which our enemies assert to be so  effective. It might be so, but actually it is not. Poor Jews feel only  the hatred which this financial power provokes; its use in  alleviating their lot as a body, they have not yet felt. The credit of  our great Jewish financiers would have to be placed at the service of  the National Idea. But should these gentlemen, who are quite satisfied  with their lot, feel indisposed to do anything for their fellow-Jews  who are unjustly held responsible for the large possessions of certain  individuals, then the realization of this plan will afford an  opportunity for drawing a clear line of distinction between them and  the rest of Jewry.    The great financiers, moreover, will certainly not be asked to raise  an amount so enormous out of pure philanthropic motives; that would be  expecting too much. The promoters and stock holders of the Jewish  Company are, on the contrary, expected to do a good piece of business,  and they will be able to calculate beforehand what their chances of  success are likely to be. For the Society of Jews will be in  possession of all documents and references which may serve to define  the prospects of the Jewish Company. The Society will in particular  have investigated with exactitude the extent of the new Jewish  movement, so as to provide the Company promoters with thoroughly  reliable information on the amount of support they may expect. The  Society will also supply the Jewish Company with comprehensive modern  Jewish statistics, thus doing the work of what is called in France a  \"societe d'etudes,\" which undertakes all preliminary research previous  to the financing of a great undertaking. Even so, the enterprise may  not receive the valuable assistance of our moneyed magnates. These  might, perhaps, even try to oppose the Jewish movement by means of  their secret agents. Such opposition we shall meet with relentless  determination.    Supposing that these magnates are content simply to turn this scheme  down with a smile:    Is it, therefore, done for?    No.    For then the money will be raised in another way--by an appeal to  moderately rich Jews. The smaller Jewish banks would have to be united  in the name of the National Idea against the big banks till they were  gathered into a second and formidable financial force. But,  unfortunately, this would require a great deal of financing at  first--for the L50,000,000 would have to be subscribed in full before  starting work; and, as this sum could only be raised very slowly, all  sorts of banking business would have to be done and loans made during  the first few years. It might even occur that, in the course of all  these transactions, their original object would be forgotten; the  moderately rich Jews would have created a new and large business, and  Jewish emigration would be forgotten.    The notion of raising money in this way is not by any means  impracticable. The experiment of collecting Christian money to form an  opposing force to the big banks has already been tried; that one could  also oppose them with Jewish money has not been thought of until now.    But these financial conflicts would bring about all sorts of crises;  the countries in which they occurred would suffer, and Anti-Semitism  would become rampant.    This method is therefore not to be recommended. I have merely  suggested it, because it comes up in the course of the logical  development of the idea.    I also do not know whether smaller private banks would be willing to  adopt it.    In any case, even the refusal of moderately rich Jews would not put an  end to the scheme. On the contrary, it would then have to be taken up  in real earnest.    The Society of Jews, whose members are not business men, might try to  found the Company on a national subscription.    The Company's capital might be raised, without the intermediary of a  syndicate, by means of direct subscription on the part of the public.  Not only poor Jews, but also Christians who wanted to get rid of them,  would subscribe a small amount to this fund. A new and peculiar form  of the plebiscite would thus be established, whereby each man who  voted for this solution of the Jewish Question would express his  opinion by subscribing a stipulated amount. This stipulation would  produce security. The funds subscribed would only be paid in if their  sum total reached the required amount, otherwise the initial payments  would be returned.    But if the whole of the required sum is raised by popular  subscription, then each little amount would be secured by the great  numbers of other small amounts.    All this would, of course, need the express and definite assistance of  interested Governments.      FOOTNOTES:    [A] The practice of paying the workman's wages in goods instead of  money.          _IV. Local Groups_    OUR TRANSMIGRATION      Previous chapters explained only how the emigration scheme might be  carried out without creating any economic disturbance. But so great a  movement cannot take place without inevitably rousing many deep and  powerful feelings. There are old customs, old memories that attach us  to our homes. We have cradles, we have graves, and we alone know how  Jewish hearts cling to the graves. Our cradles we shall carry with  us--they hold our future, rosy and smiling. Our beloved graves we must  abandon--and I think this abandonment will cost us more than any other  sacrifice. But it must be so.    Economic distress, political pressure, and social obloquy have already  driven us from our homes and from our graves. We Jews are even now  constantly shifting from place to place, a strong current actually  carrying us westward over the sea to the United States, where our  presence is also not desired. And where will our presence be desired,  so long as we are a homeless nation?    But we shall give a home to our people. And we shall give it, not by  dragging them ruthlessly out of their sustaining soil, but rather by  transplanting them carefully to a better ground. Just as we wish to  create new political and economic relations, so we shall preserve as  sacred all of the past that is dear to our people's hearts.    Hence a few suggestions must suffice, as this part of my scheme will  most probably be condemned as visionary. Yet even this is possible and  real, though it now appears to be something vague and aimless.  Organization will make of it something rational.      EMIGRATION IN GROUPS    Our people should emigrate in groups of families and friends. But no  man will be forced to join the particular group belonging to his  former place of residence. Each will be able to journey in his chosen  fashion as soon as he has settled his affairs. Seeing that each man  will pay his own expenses by rail and boat, he will naturally travel  by whatever class suits him best. Possibly there will even be no  subdivision for classes on board train and boat, so as to avoid making  the poor feel their position too keenly during their long journey.  Though we are not exactly organizing a pleasure trip, it is as well to  keep them in good humor on the way.    None will travel in penury; on the other hand, all who desire to  travel in luxurious ease will be able to follow their bent. Even under  favorable circumstances, the movement may not touch certain classes of  Jews for several years to come; the intervening period can therefore  be employed in selecting the best modes of organizing the journeys.  Those who are well off can travel in parties if they wish, taking  their personal friends and connections with them. Jews, with the  exception of the richest, have, after all, very little intercourse  with Christians. In some countries their acquaintance with them is  confined to a few spongers, borrowers, and dependents; of a better  class of Christian they know nothing. The Ghetto continues though its  walls are broken down.    The middle classes will therefore make elaborate and careful  preparations for departure. A group of travellers will be formed in  each locality, large towns being divided into districts with a group  in each district, who will communicate by means of representatives  elected for the purpose. This division into districts need not be  strictly adhered to; it is merely intended to alleviate the discomfort  and home-sickness of the poor during their journey outwards. Everybody  is free to travel either alone or attached to any local group he  prefers. The conditions of travel--r"]]]
