CHAPTER II                             THE SIEGE OF MAFEKING      President Kruger's Ultimatum having been accepted in its full  significance, General Cronje crossed the border and the telegraph wires  to Mafeking were cut. Mafeking is a smart little town on the  Bechuanaland Railway. It stands about eight miles from the Transvaal  border, about 200 miles north of Kimberley, and some 875 miles from Cape  Town. It is the headquarters of the Bechuanaland Border Police, a crack  corps, whose every member is thoroughly wide-awake and well versed in  the niceties of the guerilla style of warfare favoured of the Boers. In  the town is the \"Surrey Hotel\" and others; English, Dutch, and Wesleyan  churches; a cricket-ground and a racecourse. Its supplies, in time of  peace, are drawn from Dutch farms situated in the Marico Valley, while  its pure water is drawn from the springs at Rooi Grond in the Transvaal  territory.    Mafeking itself is less than a mile square. The railroad, running north  and south, takes a westerly bend as it crosses the Molopo River some 300  yards south of the town. In this westerly direction is a native Stadt, a  constellation of mushroom huts wherein the blacks congregate. To east,  north, and west the surrounding country is flat; elsewhere it rises and  affords a certain amount of cover. Towards the south-east is Sir Charles  Warren's old fort, named Cannon Kopje, which was viewed as the key of  the position and promptly rendered impregnable. In the north-west corner  of the town was the railway station, now useless; on the north-east, the  convent; on the south-east, Ellis House; and south-west, the Pound, near  which were the quarters of the British South African Police. The  population of the town consisted of some 2000 whites, while in the  Stadt, owing to the presence of native refugees, there were about 7000  blacks.    On the outbreak of hostilities, Colonel Baden-Powell, who had been sent  out on special service to South Africa to report on the defences of  Rhodesia, applied himself at once to face a situation which made demands  on all his extensive capabilities. In the very early days of the  investment he got guns into position and made dashing sorties,  determining to show the besiegers that they would not have what in  popular phrase is known as \"a walk over.\" So great was the versatility  of this officer, that, while these energetic measures for the protection  of those around him were going forward, he yet managed to correct and  send home proofs of a \"Manual on Scouting,\" a work at the moment most  interesting and precious to the military man, while to the layman it  makes as good reading as the \"Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.\" In  Mafeking was also Major Lord Edward Cecil (Grenadier Guards), D.S.O.,  the fourth son of the Prime Minister--whose activity and energy were  remarkable, even in a community where those qualities were  ubiquitous--and Captain Gordon Wilson (Royal Horse Guards), with his  wife, Lady Sarah Wilson, a lady of much enterprise, to whose energies  the garrison owed not a little. Among others there were Colonel Hore  (South Staffordshire Regiment), Major Godley (Royal Dublin Fusiliers),  Captain Marsh (Royal West Kent Regiment), Captain Vernon (King's Royal  Rifles), Captain FitzClarence (Royal Fusiliers), Lord Charles  Cavendish-Bentinck (9th Lancers), the Hon. H. Hanbury-Tracy (Royal Horse  Guards), Lieut. Singleton (Highland Light Infantry), Captain the Hon. D.  Marsham (4th Bedfordshire Regiment), Captain Pechell (3rd King's Royal  Rifles), and Major Anderson (R.A.M.C.). There were in addition several  Colonial officers who proved themselves the soul of activity--notably  Captain Goodyear, Captain Nesbitt, V.C., Lieuts. Paton and Murchison,  and several others. Colonel Vyvyen and Major Panzera also worked like  Trojans to secure the safety of the town. Major Baillie of the _Morning  Post_ made himself useful in every capacity. Later on he forwarded a  description of the garrison which gave a good idea of the splendid plan  of organisation adopted. He said:--         \"The town was garrisoned by the Cape Police under Captains       Brown and Marsh. These and the Railway Volunteers were under       Colonel Vivian, while Cannon Kopje was entrusted to Colonel       Walford and the B.S.A.P. Colonel Baden-Powell retained one       squadron of the Protectorate Regiment as reserve under his own       immediate control. These arrangements were subsequently much       augmented. After the convent had been practically demolished by       shell-fire, and the railway line all round the town pulled up       or mined during the close investment by the Boers, the small       work was erected at the convent corner, garrisoned by the Cape       Police and a Maxim under Lieutenant Murray, who was also put in       charge of the armoured train, which had been withdrawn to the       railway station out of harm's way.         \"The Railway Volunteers garrisoned the cemetery, and had an       advance trench about 800 yards to the front and immediately to       the right of the line. To the westward came Fort Cardigan, and       then again Fort Miller; to the south-west was Major Godley's       Fort, at the north of the native stadt, with Fort Ayr, and an       advance fort crowning the down to the northern end of the       stadt, and though rather detached, having command of the view       for a great distance. To the south of the northern portion of       the stadt the Cape Police were intrenched with a Maxim, and 500       yards to the west front of Captain Marsh's post lay Limestone       Fort, commanding the valley, on the other side of which lay the       Boer laager and intrenchments. At the south-western corner, and       on the edge of the stadt Captain Marsh's fort was situated. The       whole of the edge of the stadt was furnished with loopholes and       trenches, and was garrisoned by the native inhabitants. Near       the railway were situated two armoured trucks with a       Nordenfeldt, and Cannon Kopje with two Maxims and a 7-pounder       lay to the south-east. And now to the immediate defences of the       town. At the south-western corner is the Pound, garrisoned by       Cape Police under Captain Marsh, then eastwards is Early's       Fort, Dixon's Redan, Ball's Fort, Ellis's corner, with Maxim       and Cape Police, under Captain Brown. On the eastern front are       Ellitson's Kraal, Musson's Fort, De Kock's Fort with Maxim,       Recreation Ground Fort. To the left of the convent lies the       Hospital Fort. All these, unless otherwise mentioned, are       defended by the Town Guard.\"    Operations began on the 12th with an episode that cannot afford to be  forgotten. It was discovered that two trucks of dynamite were in the  station yard, and it was at once decided, for the safety of the  population, that they must be removed. An engine was, therefore,  despatched in charge of a plucky driver (Perry) for the purpose of  conveying the trucks into the open, where they might explode without  danger to the town. While he was engaged in the work of deporting the  destructive material, the enemy suddenly appeared and commenced to fire.  Perry, with the utmost coolness, a coolness which in the circumstances  was nothing less than heroism, uncoupled his engine, and leaving the  trucks to their fate, steamed back to the town. Before he could reach  his destination, however, the shock of an awful detonation greeted his  ears. The Boers had again fired on the trucks, believing them to be full  of passengers, and, as a natural consequence, the dynamite had exploded!    The garrison, numbering from 800 to 1000, now began to furbish itself  up, to arm and practise with the rifle. The old forts round the place  were put into repair, and the armoured train, with a Maxim gun and a  Nordenfeldt, was made ready for coming excursions. Nothing was  neglected. It was well known that the Boers looked upon the town as  their personal property, and when it came to fighting, meant to make it  so--if they could! The two available regiments, the Protectorate  Regiment and the Mounted Police, spent most of their time manoeuvring,  with a view to awakening the intelligent interests of the ranks and  instructing the men on the nature of the ground in the vicinity. Colonel  Baden-Powell lost no opportunity of preparing for the gallant Cronje,  and, in order to show that he did not mean to be caught napping, some  nights were passed by the garrison in their day kit.    On the 12th October an armoured train that was escorting two light guns  of old pattern from the Cape to Mafeking was seized by the Boers, who  had torn up the rails at Kraalpan. They pounded the machine with  artillery, and captured it with guns and men in charge--all, save the  engine-driver, being made prisoners. Lieutenant Nesbitt was wounded and  the driver lost five fingers. The latter escaped through hiding himself  in the sand and thus avoiding observation. In Mafeking itself the  Sisters of the Roman Catholic Convent busied themselves. These noble  women refused to leave the place, electing to remain face to face with  danger in order to nurse the sick. Many of the houses were converted  into hospitals, all the streets were barred with waggons, and even the  inhabitants of the town were supplied with rifles and taught the use of  them. The telegraph wires were now cut at Maribogo, some forty miles  south of Mafeking. The bridge that crossed the Molopo River above  Mafeking was next blown up by the Boers with tremendous uproar. Still  the inhabitants were not dismayed. They had implicit confidence in their  commander and worked incessantly. As a defensive position, Kimberley,  whose history will be told later, had the advantage of Mafeking. The  refuse heaps from the mines at the former place served as natural  fortifications.

STARCHY BEVERAGES      Starchy drinks consist of cereals or cereal products, cooked thoroughly  in a large amount of water and strained before serving. Arrowroot,  cornstarch, tapioca, rice and rice flour are nearly pure starch. Oats,  barley and wheat in forms which include the whole grains contain besides  starch some protein and fat, and also valuable mineral matter,  especially phosphorous, iron, and calcium salts. In starchy drinks these  ingredients are necessarily present in small amounts; hence they have  little energy value, unless milk or other highly nutritive material is  added. Such drinks are of value when only a small quantity of nutriment  can be taken.    _Principles of Cooking._ As the chief ingredient is starch, long cooking  is necessary, in water at a high temperature (212 deg. F.), which softens  the cellulose, and breaks open the starch grains, changing the insoluble  starch to soluble starch and dextrin, so that it can be readily  digested.    Time of cooking should be conscientiously kept by the clock.    _Digestion._ The action of ptyalin is very rapid, and if these drinks  are sipped slowly, so as to be thoroughly mixed with saliva, a  considerable portion of starch may be changed to sugar before reaching  the intestines.      Barley Water, 180 Calories              2 tablespoons pearl barley            1 quart cold water    Wash barley, add cold water and let soak several hours or over night; in  same water, boil gently over direct heat two hours, or in a double  boiler steadily four hours, down to one pint if used for infant feeding,  and to one cup for the adult. Strain through muslin.    NOTE.--Cream or milk and salt may be added, or lemon juice and sugar.  Barley water is an astringent or demulcent drink used to reduce laxative  condition.      Rice Water, 100 Calories[8]              2 tablespoons rice            3 cups cold water            Salt            Milk    Wash the rice; add cold water and soak thirty minutes, heat gradually to  boiling point and cook one hour or until rice is tender. Strain, reheat  and dilute with boiling water or hot milk to desired consistency. Season  with salt.    NOTE.--Sugar may be added if desired, and cinnamon, if allowed, may be  cooked with it, and will assist in reducing a laxative condition.
