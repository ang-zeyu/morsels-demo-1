The town house of the Lady de Tilly stood on the upper part of the Place  d'Armes, a broad, roughly-paved square. The Chateau of St. Louis, with  its massive buildings and high, peaked roofs, filled one side of the  square. On the other side, embowered in ancient trees that had escaped  the axe of Champlain's hardy followers, stood the old-fashioned  Monastery of the Recollets, with its high belfry and broad shady porch,  where the monks in gray gowns and sandals sat in summer, reading their  breviaries or exchanging salutations with the passers-by, who always had  a kind greeting for the brothers of St. Francis.    The mansion of the Lady de Tilly was of stone, spacious and ornate, as  became the rank and wealth of the Seigneurs de Tilly. It overlooked the  Place d'Armes and the noble gardens of the Chateau of St. Louis, with  a magnificent sweep of the St. Lawrence, flowing majestically under the  fortress-crowned cape and the high, wooded hills of Lauzon, the farther  side of the river closing the view.    In the recess of an ornate mullioned window, half concealed by the rich,  heavy curtains of a noble room, Amelie de Repentigny sat alone--very  quiet in look and demeanor, but no little agitated in mind, as might  be noticed in the nervous contact of her hands, which lay in her lap  clasping each other very hard, as if trying to steady her thoughts.    Her aunt was receiving some lady visitors in the great drawing-room. The  hum of loud feminine voices reached the ear of Amelie, but she paid no  attention, so absorbed was she in the new and strange thoughts that  had stirred in her mind since morning, when she had learned from the  Chevalier La Corne of the return to New France of Pierre Philibert. The  news had surprised her to a degree she could not account for. Her first  thought was, how fortunate for her brother that Pierre had returned;  her second, how agreeable to herself. Why? She could not think why: she  wilfully drew an inference away from the truth that lay in her heart--it  was wholly for the sake of her brother she rejoiced in the return of his  friend and preserver. Her heart beat a little faster than usual--that  was the result of her long walk and disappointment at not meeting  Le Gardeur on her arrival yesterday. But she feared to explore her  thoughts: a rigid self-examination might discover what she instinctively  felt was deeply concealed there.    A subtile, indefinable prevision had suggested to her that Colonel  Philibert would not have failed to meet Le Gardeur at Beaumanoir, and  that he would undoubtedly accompany her brother on his return and call  to pay his respects to the Lady de Tilly and--to herself. She felt her  cheek glow at the thought, yet she was half vexed at her own foolish  fancy, as she called it. She tried to call upon her pride, but that came  very laggardly to the relief of her discomposure.    Her interview, too, with Angelique des Meloises had caused her no little  disquiet. The bold avowals of Angelique with reference to the Intendant  had shocked Amelie. She knew that her brother had given more of his  thoughts to this beautiful, reckless girl than was good for his peace,  should her ambition ever run counter to his love.    The fond sister sighed deeply when she reflected that the woman who had  power to make prize of Le Gardeur's love was not worthy of him.    It is no rare thing for loving sisters who have to resign their brothers  to others' keeping to think so. But Amelie knew that Angelique des  Meloises was incapable of that true love which only finds its own in the  happiness of another. She was vain, selfish, ambitious, and--what Amelie  did not yet know--possessed of neither scruple nor delicacy in attaining  her objects.    It had chimed the hour of noon upon the old clock of the Recollets, and  Amelie still sat looking wistfully over the great square of the Place  d'Armes, and curiously scanning every horseman that rode across it. A  throng of people moved about the square, or passed in and out of the  great arched gateway of the Castle of St. Louis. A bright shield,  bearing the crown and fleur-de-lis, surmounted the gate, and under it  walked, with military pace, a couple of sentries, their muskets and  bayonets flashing out in the sun every time they wheeled to return on  their beat. Occasionally there was a ruffle of drums: the whole  guard turned out and presented arms, as some officer of high rank, or  ecclesiastical dignitary, passed through to pay his respects to the  Governor, or transact business at the vice-regal court. Gentlemen on  foot, with chapeaux and swords, carrying a cloak on their shoulders;  ladies in visiting dress; habitans and their wives in unchanging  costume; soldiers in uniform, and black-gowned clergy, mingled in a  moving picture of city life, which, had not Amelie's thoughts been so  preoccupied to-day, would have afforded her great delight to look out  upon.    The Lady de Tilly had rather wearied of the visit of the two ladies of  the city, Madame de Grandmaison and Madame Couillard, who had bored her  with all the current gossip of the day. They were rich and fashionable,  perfect in etiquette, costume, and most particular in their society;  but the rank and position of the noble Lady de Tilly made her friendship  most desirable, as it conferred in the eyes of the world a patent of  gentility which held good against every pretension to overtop it.    The stream of city talk from the lips of the two ladies had the merit  of being perfect of its kind--softly insinuating and sweetly censorious,  superlative in eulogy and infallible in opinion. The good visitors most  conscientiously discharged what they deemed a great moral and social  duty by enlightening the Lady de Tilly on all the recent lapses and  secrets of the capital. They slid over slippery topics like skaters on  thin ice, filling their listener with anxiety lest they should break  through. But Madame de Grandmaison and her companion were too well  exercised in the gymnastics of gossip to overbalance themselves. Half  Quebec was run over and run down in the course of an hour.    Lady de Tilly listened with growing impatience to their frivolities, but  she knew society too well to quarrel with its follies when it was of no  service to do so: she contented herself with hoping it was not so bad.  The Pope was not Catholic enough to suit some people, but, for her part,  she had generally found people better than they were called.    A rather loud but well-bred exclamation of Madame de Grandmaison roused  Amelie from her day-dream.    \"Not going to the Intendant's ball at the Palace, my Lady de Tilly!  neither you nor Mademoiselle de Repentigny, whom we are so sorry not to  have seen to-day? Why, it is to be the most magnificent affair ever got  up in New France. All Quebec has rung with nothing else for a fortnight,  and every milliner and modiste in the city has gone almost insane over  the superlative costumes to be worn there.\"    \"And it is to be the most select in its character,\" chimed in Madame  Couillard; \"all gentry and noblesse, not one of the bourgeois to  be invited. That class, especially the female portion of them, give  themselves such airs nowadays! As if their money made them company for  people of quality! They must be kept down, I say, or--\"    \"And the Royal Intendant quite agrees with the general sentiment of the  higher circles,\" responded Madame de Grandmaison. \"He is for keeping  down--\"    \"Noblesse! Noblesse!\" The Lady de Tilly spoke with visible impatience.  \"Who is this Royal Intendant who dares cast a slight upon the worthy,  honest bourgeoisie of this city? Is he noble himself? Not that I would  think worse of him were he not, but I have heard it disputed. He is the  last one who should venture to scorn the bourgeoisie.\"    Madame de Grandmaison fanned herself in a very stately manner. \"Oh, my  Lady, you surely forget! The Chevalier Bigot is a distant relative of  the Count de Marville, and the Chevalier de Grandmaison is a constant  visitor at the Intendant's! But he would not have sat at his table an  hour had he not known that he was connected with the nobility. The Count  de Marville--\"    \"The Count de Marville!\" interrupted the Lady de Tilly, whose politeness  almost gave way. \"Truly, a man is known by the company he keeps. No  credit to any one to be connected with the Count de Marville.\"    Madame de Grandmaison felt rather subdued. She perceived that the Lady  de Tilly was not favorably impressed towards the Intendant. But she  tried again: \"And then, my Lady, the Intendant is so powerful at Court.  He was a particular friend of Madame d'Etioles before she was known  at Court, and they say he managed her introduction to the King at the  famous masked ball at the Hotel de Ville, when His Majesty threw  his handkerchief at her, and she became first dame du palais and the  Marquise de Pompadour. She has ever remained his firm friend, and in  spite of all his enemies could do to prevent it His Majesty made him  Intendant of New France.\"    \"In spite of all the King's friends could do, you mean,\" replied the  Lady de Tilly, in a tone the sound of which caught the ear of Amelie,  and she knew her aunt was losing patience with her visitors. Lady de  Tilly heard the name of the royal mistress with intense disgust, but  her innate loyalty prevented her speaking disparagingly of the King.  \"We will not discuss the Court,\" said she, \"nor the friendships of this  Intendant. I can only pray his future may make amends for his past.  I trust New France may not have as much reason as poor lost Acadia to  lament the day of his coming to the Colonies.\"    The two lady visitors were not obtuse. They saw they had roused the  susceptibilities--prejudices, they called them--of the Lady de Tilly.  They rose, and smothering their disappointment under well-bred phrases,  took"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27365"],[0,"Tales of Space and Time (#20)"],[1," them.    The next day they sat again nearer--without stones or sticks, and with  the same offerings, and Cat's-skin had a trout. It was rare men caught  fish in those days, but Cat's-skin would stand silently in the water for  hours and catch them with his hand. And the fourth day Ugh-lomi suffered  these three to come to the squatting-place in peace, with the food they  had with them. Ugh-lomi ate the trout. Thereafter for many moons  Ugh-lomi was master and had his will in peace. And on the fulness of  time he was killed and eaten even as Uya had been slain.          A Story of the Days to Come          A STORY OF THE DAYS TO COME      I--THE CURE FOR LOVE    The excellent Mr. Morris was an Englishman, and he lived in the days of  Queen Victoria the Good. He was a prosperous and very sensible man; he  read the _Times_ and went to church, and as he grew towards middle age  an expression of quiet contented contempt for all who were not as  himself settled on his face. He was one of those people who do  everything that is right and proper and sensible with inevitable  regularity. He always wore just the right and proper clothes, steering  the narrow way between the smart and the shabby, always subscribed to  the right charities, just the judicious compromise between ostentation  and meanness, and never failed to have his hair cut to exactly the  proper length.    Everything that it was right and proper for a man in his position to  possess, he possessed; and everything that it was not right and proper  for a man in his position to possess, he did not possess.    And among other right and proper possessions, this Mr. Morris had a wife  and children. They were the right sort of wife, and the right sort and  number of children, of course; nothing imaginative or highty-flighty  about any of them, so far as Mr. Morris could see; they wore perfectly  correct clothing, neither smart nor hygienic nor faddy in any way, but  just sensible; and they lived in a nice sensible house in the later  Victorian sham Queen Anne style of architecture, with sham  half-timbering of chocolate-painted plaster in the gables, Lincrusta  Walton sham carved oak panels, a terrace of terra cotta to imitate  stone, and cathedral glass in the front door. His boys went to good  solid schools, and were put to respectable professions; his girls, in  spite of a fantastic protest or so, were all married to suitable,  steady, oldish young men with good prospects. And when it was a fit and  proper thing for him to do so, Mr. Morris died. His tomb was of marble,  and, without any art nonsense or laudatory inscription, quietly  imposing--such being the fashion of his time.    He underwent various changes according to the accepted custom in these  cases, and long before this story begins his bones even had become dust,  and were scattered to the four quarters of heaven. And his sons and his  grandsons and his great-grandsons and his great-great-grandsons, they  too were dust and ashes, and were scattered likewise. It was a thing he  could not have imagined, that a day would come when even his  great-great-grandsons would be scattered to the four winds of heaven. If  any one had suggested it to him he would have resented it. He was one of  those worthy people who take no interest in the future of mankind at  all. He had grave doubts, indeed, if there was any future for mankind  after he was dead.    It seemed quite impossible and quite uninteresting to imagine anything  happening after he was dead. Yet the thing was so, and when even his  great-great-grandson was dead and decayed and forgotten, when the sham  half-timbered house had gone the way of all shams, and the _Times_ was  extinct, and the silk hat a ridiculous antiquity, and the modestly  imposing stone that had been sacred to Mr. Morris had been burnt to make  lime for mortar, and all that Mr. Morris had found real and important  was sere and dead, the world was still going on, and people were still  going about it, just as heedless and impatient of the Future, or,  indeed, of anything but their own selves and property, as Mr. Morris had  been.    And, strange to tell, and much as Mr. Morris would have been angered if  any one had foreshadowed it to him, all over the world there were  scattered a multitude of people, filled with the breath of life, in  whose veins the blood of Mr. Morris flowed. Just as some day the life  which is gathered now in the reader of this very story may also be  scattered far and wide about this world, and mingled with a thousand  alien strains, beyond all thought and tracing.    And among the descendants of this Mr. Morris was one almost as sensible  and clear-headed as his ancestor. He had just the same stout, short  frame as that ancient man of the nineteenth century, from whom his name  of Morris--he spelt it Mwres--came; he had the same half-contemptuous  expression of face. He was a prosperous person, too, as times went, and  he disliked the \"new-fangled,\" and bothers about the future and the  lower classes, just as much as the ancestral Morris had done. He did not  read the _Times_: indeed, he did not know there ever had been a  _Times_--that institution had foundered somewhere in the intervening  gulf of years; but the phonograph machine, that talked to him as he  made his toilet of a morning, might have been the voice of a  reincarnated Blowitz when it dealt with the world's affairs. This  phonographic machine was the size and shape of a Dutch clock, and down  the front of it were electric barometric indicators, and an electric  clock and calendar, and automatic engagement reminders, and where the  clock would have been was the mouth of a trumpet. When it had news the  trumpet gobbled like a turkey, \"Galloop, galloop,\" and then brayed out  its message as, let us say, a trumpet might bray. It would tell Mwres in  full, rich, throaty tones about the overnight accidents to the omnibus  flying-machines that plied around the world, the latest arrivals at the  fashionable resorts in Tibet, and of all the great monopolist company  meetings of the day before, while he was dressing. If Mwres did not like  hearing what it said, he had only to touch a stud, and it would choke a  little and talk about something else.    Of course his toilet differed very much from that of his ancestor. It is  doubtful which would have been the more shocked and pained to find  himself in the clothing of the other. Mwres would certainly have sooner  gone forth to the world stark naked than in the silk hat, frock coat,  grey trousers and watch-chain that had filled Mr. Morris with sombre  self-respect in the past. For Mwres there was no shaving to do: a  skilful operator had long ago removed every hair-root from his face. His  legs he encased in pleasant pink and amber garments of an air-tight  material, which with the help of an ingenious little pump he distended  so as to suggest enormous muscles. Above this he also wore pneumatic  garments beneath an amber silk tunic, so that he was clothed in air and  admirably protected against sudden extremes of heat or cold. Over this  he flung a scarlet cloak with its edge fantastically curved. On his  head, which had been skilfully deprived of every scrap of hair, he  adjusted a pleasant little cap of bright scarlet, held on by suction and  inflated with hydrogen, and curiously like the comb of a cock. So his  toilet was complete; and, conscious of being soberly and becomingly  attired, he was ready to face his fellow-beings with a tranquil eye.    This Mwres--the civility of \"Mr.\" had vanished ages ago--was one of the  officials under the Wind Vane and Waterfall Trust, the great company  that owned every wind wheel and waterfall in the world, and which pumped  all the water and supplied all the electric energy that people in these  latter days required. He lived in a vast hotel near that part of London  called Seventh Way, and had very large and comfortable apartments on the  seventeenth floor. Households and family life had long since disappeared  with the progressive refinement of manners; and indeed the steady rise  in rents and land values, the disappearance of domestic servants, the  elaboration of cookery, had rendered the separate domicile of Victorian  times impossible, even had any one desired such a savage seclusion. When  his toilet was completed he went towards one of the two doors of his  apartment--there were doors at opposite ends, each marked with a huge  arrow pointing one one way and one the other--touched a stud to open it,  and emerged on a wide passage, the centre of which bore chairs and was  moving at a steady pace to the left. On some of these chairs were seated  gaily-dressed men and women. He nodded to an acquaintance--it was not in  those days etiquette to talk before breakfast--and seated himself on one  of these chairs, and in a few seconds he had been carried to the doors  of a lift, by which he descended to the great and splendid hall in which  his breakfast would be automatically served.    It was a very different meal from a Victorian breakfast. The rude  masses of bread needing to be carved and smeared over with animal fat  before they could be made palatable, the still recognisable fragments of  recently killed animals, hideously charred and hacked, the eggs torn  ruthlessly from beneath some protesting hen,--such things as these,  though they constituted the ordinary fare of Victorian times, would have  awakened only horror and disgust in the refined minds of the people of  these latter days. Instead were pastes and cakes of agreeable and  variegated design, without any suggestion in colour or form of the  unfortunate animals from which their substance and juices were derived.  They appeared on little dishes sliding out upon a rail from a little box  at one side of the table. The surface of the table, to judge by touch  and eye, would have appeared to a nineteenth-century person to be  covered with fine"]]]
