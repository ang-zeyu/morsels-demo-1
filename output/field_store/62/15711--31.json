And so in a quick Consecution of the Colours the Impression of  every Colour remains in the Sensorium, until a Revolution of all the  Colours be compleated, and that first Colour return again. The  Impressions therefore of all the successive Colours are at once in the  Sensorium, and jointly stir up a Sensation of them all; and so it is  manifest by this Experiment, that the commix'd Impressions of all the  Colours do stir up and beget a Sensation of white, that is, that  Whiteness is compounded of all the Colours.    And if the Comb be now taken away, that all the Colours may at once pass  from the Lens to the Paper, and be there intermixed, and together  reflected thence to the Spectator's Eyes; their Impressions on the  Sensorium being now more subtilly and perfectly commixed there, ought  much more to stir up a Sensation of Whiteness.    You may instead of the Lens use two Prisms HIK and LMN, which by  refracting the coloured Light the contrary Way to that of the first  Refraction, may make the diverging Rays converge and meet again in G, as  you see represented in the seventh Figure. For where they meet and mix,  they will compose a white Light, as when a Lens is used.    _Exper._ 11. Let the Sun's coloured Image PT [in _Fig._ 8.] fall upon  the Wall of a dark Chamber, as in the third Experiment of the first  Book, and let the same be viewed through a Prism _abc_, held parallel to  the Prism ABC, by whose Refraction that Image was made, and let it now  appear lower than before, suppose in the Place S over-against the red  Colour T. And if you go near to the Image PT, the Spectrum S will appear  oblong and coloured like the Image PT; but if you recede from it, the  Colours of the spectrum S will be contracted more and more, and at  length vanish, that Spectrum S becoming perfectly round and white; and  if you recede yet farther, the Colours will emerge again, but in a  contrary Order. Now that Spectrum S appears white in that Case, when the  Rays of several sorts which converge from the several Parts of the Image  PT, to the Prism _abc_, are so refracted unequally by it, that in their  Passage from the Prism to the Eye they may diverge from one and the same  Point of the Spectrum S, and so fall afterwards upon one and the same  Point in the bottom of the Eye, and there be mingled.    [Illustration: FIG. 7.]    [Illustration: FIG. 8.]    And farther, if the Comb be here made use of, by whose Teeth the Colours  at the Image PT may be successively intercepted; the Spectrum S, when  the Comb is moved slowly, will be perpetually tinged with successive  Colours: But when by accelerating the Motion of the Comb, the Succession  of the Colours is so quick that they cannot be severally seen, that  Spectrum S, by a confused and mix'd Sensation of them all, will appear  white.    _Exper._ 12. The Sun shining through a large Prism ABC [in _Fig._ 9.]  upon a Comb XY, placed immediately behind the Prism, his Light which  passed through the Interstices of the Teeth fell upon a white Paper DE.  The Breadths of the Teeth were equal to their Interstices, and seven  Teeth together with their Interstices took up an Inch in Breadth. Now,  when the Paper was about two or three Inches distant from the Comb, the  Light which passed through its several Interstices painted so many  Ranges of Colours, _kl_, _mn_, _op_, _qr_, &c. which were parallel to  one another, and contiguous, and without any Mixture of white. And these  Ranges of Colours, if the Comb was moved continually up and down with a  reciprocal Motion, ascended and descended in the Paper, and when the  Motion of the Comb was so quick, that the Colours could not be  distinguished from one another, the whole Paper by their Confusion and  Mixture in the Sensorium appeared white.    [Illustration: FIG. 9.]    Let the Comb now rest, and let the Paper be removed farther from the  Prism, and the several Ranges of Colours will be dilated and expanded  into one another more and more, and by mixing their Colours will dilute  one another, and at length, when the distance of the Paper from the Comb  is about a Foot, or a little more (suppose in the Place 2D 2E) they will  so far dilute one another, as to become white.    With any Obstacle, let all the Light be now stopp'd which passes through  any one Interval of the Teeth, so that the Range of Colours which comes  from thence may be taken away, and you will see the Light of the rest of  the Ranges to be expanded into the Place of the Range taken away, and  there to be coloured. Let the intercepted Range pass on as before, and  its Colours falling upon the Colours of the other Ranges, and mixing  with them, will restore the Whiteness.    Let the Paper 2D 2E be now very much inclined to the Rays, so that the  most refrangible Rays may be more copiously reflected than the rest, and  the white Colour of the Paper through the Excess of those Rays will be  changed into blue and violet. Let the Paper be as much inclined the  contrary way, that the least refrangible Rays may be now more copiously  reflected than the rest, and by their Excess the Whiteness will be  changed into yellow and red. The several Rays therefore in that white  Light do retain their colorific Qualities, by which those of any sort,  whenever they become more copious than the rest, do by their Excess and  Predominance cause their proper Colour to appear.    And by the same way of arguing, applied to the third Experiment of this  second Part of the first Book, it may be concluded, that the white  Colour of all refracted Light at its very first Emergence, where it  appears as white as before its Incidence, is compounded of various  Colours.    [Illustration: FIG. 10.]    _Exper._ 13. In the foregoing Experiment the several Intervals of the  Teeth of the Comb do the Office of so many Prisms, every Interval  producing the Phaenomenon of one Prism. Whence instead of those Intervals  using several Prisms, I try'd to compound Whiteness by mixing their  Colours, and did it by using only three Prisms, as also by using only  two as follows. Let two Prisms ABC and _abc_, [in _Fig._ 10.] whose  refracting Angles B and _b_ are equal, be so placed parallel to one  another, that the refracting Angle B of the one may touch the Angle _c_  at the Base of the other, and their Planes CB and _cb_, at which the  Rays emerge, may lie in Directum. Then let the Light trajected through  them fall upon the Paper MN, distant about 8 or 12 Inches from the  Prisms. And the Colours generated by the interior Limits B and _c_ of  the two Prisms, will be mingled at PT, and there compound white. For if  either Prism be taken away, the Colours made by the other will appear in  that Place PT, and when the Prism is restored to its Place again, so  that its Colours may there fall upon the Colours of the other, the  Mixture of them both will restore the Whiteness.    This Experiment succeeds also, as I have tried, when the Angle _b_ of  the lower Prism, is a little greater than the Angle B of the upper, and  between the interior Angles B and _c_, there intercedes some Space B_c_,  as is represented in the Figure, and the refracting Planes BC and _bc_,  are neither in Directum, nor parallel to one another. For there is  nothing more requisite to the Success of this Experiment, than that the  Rays of all sorts may be uniformly mixed upon the Paper in the Place PT.  If the most refrangible Rays coming from the superior Prism take up all  the Space from M to P, the Rays of the same sort which come from the  inferior Prism ought to begin at P, and take up all the rest of the  Space from thence towards N. If the least refrangible Rays coming from  the superior Prism take up the Space MT, the Rays of the same kind which  come from the other Prism ought to begin at T, and take up the  remaining Space TN. If one sort of the Rays which have intermediate  Degrees of Refrangibility, and come from the superior Prism be extended  through the Space MQ, and another sort of those Rays through the Space  MR, and a third sort of them through the Space MS, the same sorts of  Rays coming from the lower Prism, ought to illuminate the remaining  Spaces QN, RN, SN, respectively. And the same is to be understood of all  the other sorts of Rays. For thus the Rays of every sort will be  scattered uniformly and evenly through the whole Space MN, and so being  every where mix'd in the same Proportion, they must every where produce  the same Colour. And therefore, since by this Mixture they produce white  in the Exterior Spaces MP and TN, they must also produce white in the  Interior Space PT. This is the reason of the Composition by which  Whiteness was produced in this Experiment, and by what other way soever  I made the like Composition, the Result was Whiteness.    Lastly, If with the Teeth of a Comb of a due Size, the coloured Lights  of the two Prisms which fall upon the Space PT be alternately  intercepted, that Space PT, when the Motion of the Comb is slow, will  always appear coloured, but by accelerating the Motion of the Comb so  much that the successive Colours cannot be distinguished from one  another, it will appear white.    _Exper._ 14. Hitherto I have produced Whiteness by mixing the Colours of  Prisms. If now the Colours of natural Bodies are to be mingled, let  Water a little thicken'd with Soap be agitated to raise a Froth, and  after that Froth has stood a little, there will appear to one that shall  view it intently various Colours every where in the Surfaces of the  several Bubbles; but to one that shall go so far off, that he cannot  distinguish the Colours from one another, the whole Froth will grow  white with a perfect Whiteness.    _Exper._ 15. Lastly, In attempting to compound a white, by mixing the  coloured Powders which Painters use, I consider'd that all colour'd  Powders do suppress and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33527"],[0,"Whales, Dolphins, and Porpoises of the Western North Atlantic (#20)"],[1,"ice in October and  November. Though the migration has not been as thoroughly described,  killer whales apparently begin shifting southwards in autumn.      Stranded Specimens    Stranded killer whales should be readily identifiable by the robust  body, the distinctive body markings, and in larger animals the tall  dorsal fin. Killer whales have from 10 to 12 large, prominent teeth on  each side of the upper and lower jaws.    [Illustration: Figure 89.--Killer whales are often distributed very  close to shore. In these photos from Baja California, they are shown in  two characteristic behaviors--breaching (top) and \"spy-hopping\" or  \"pitchpoling\" (bottom). (_Photos by S. Leatherwood._)]    [Illustration: Figure 88.--A small herd of killer whales off southern  California (top) and details of an adult male from that herd (middle)  and of females or immature males off Islas San Benito, Baja California  (bottom). Adult males have a tall erect dorsal fin, which may be more  than 6 feet (1.8 m) tall, while the fins of females and immature males  are less than 3 feet (0.9 m) tall, distinctly falcate, and pointed on  the tip. Both sexes frequently have a grayish-white region, called a  \"saddle,\" behind the dorsal fin. (_Photos by T. Dohl (top and middle)  and S. Leatherwood (bottom)._)]    [Illustration: Figure 90.--A leaping killer whale in California  aquarium. Note the distinctive coloration of the species, white on the  lower jaw, the belly and the anus, and on both sides above the anus.  Note also the distinctive white eye patch often visible on animals at  sea. (_Photo by D. K. Caldwell._)]    [Illustration: Figure 91.--Killer whales have from 10 to 12 large  prominent teeth, curved slightly backwards and inwards on each side of  each jaw. (_Photos from Point Mugu, Calif. by S. Leatherwood._)]          FALSE KILLER WHALE (T)    _Pseudorca crassidens_ (Owen 1846)      Other Common Names    Mongoose (St. Vincent).      Description    False killer whales in the western North Atlantic reach a length of at  least 18 feet (5.5 m). Males are slightly larger than females. Calves  from 5 to 7 feet (1.5 to 2.1 m) may be seen at any time throughout the  year.    The dorsal fin, located just behind the midpoint of the back, is from 7  to 16 inches (17.8 to 40.6 cm) tall, falcate, and variable to sharply  pointed on the tip. The flippers are characterized by a broad hump on  the front margin near the middle, a characteristic which is diagnostic  for the species.    The body of the species is all black except for a blaze of gray on the  belly between the flippers. This blaze varies from barely visible to  light grayish white similar to but generally fainter than that of pilot  whales. The body is long and slender, and the head is narrow and gently  tapered from the area of the blowhole forward.      Natural History Notes    False killer whales are a social form and may occur in herds of up to at  least 100 individuals. They often jump clear of the water and frequently  ride the bow waves of vessels. They are the only \"blackfish\" which are  known to do so. False killer whales feed primarily on squid and large  fishes and are notorious for their habit of stealing fish from the lines  of fishermen. The large prominent teeth may be visible on a swimming  animal.      May Be Confused With    False killer whales may be confused with killer whales, pilot whales, or  the smaller, poorly known pygmy killer whale (p. 138) and many-toothed  blackfish (p. 142).    The characteristics distinguishing the species from the killer whale are  tabularized on p. 84; its differences from the pilot whales are  summarized on p. 92.    At sea, false killer whales are distinguishable from the other two  species primarily by their larger size and differences in coloration.  False killer whales are up to 18 feet (5.5 m) in length. Pygmy killer  whales and many-toothed blackfish reach only 8-9 feet (2.4-2.7 m) in  length. Pygmy killer whales have an extensive region of white on the  belly which may extend onto the sides and both pygmy killer whales and  many-toothed blackfish have a distinctive white region on the lips,  usually lacking or indistinct on false killer whales.    Neither of the smaller species of blackfish has been reported to ride  bow waves.      Distribution    False killer whales are widely distributed in the pelagic tropical,  subtropical, and warm temperate waters of the western North Atlantic.  They have been reported from off Maryland south along the mainland  coasts of North America, in the Gulf of Mexico from Cuba and the Lesser  Antilles, and from the southeast Caribbean Sea. The species has been  reported from Venezuela.      Stranded Specimens    Stranded false killer whales can be positively identified by: 1) the  large size (to 18 feet [5.5 m]); 2) the slender body tapering rapidly to  a long slender head; 3) the markedly long mouth, with from 8 to 11  large, conspicuous teeth in each side of each jaw recalling those of the  killer whale, but circular and not, as in killer whales, elliptical; 4)  the unusually shaped flipper bulging conspicuously on the forward  margin.    For comparison with \"blackfish\" of similar size (the pilot whales) see  p. 92 and 94.    False killer whales do not appear to occur frequently in coastal waters,  sandy bays, or estuaries, though entire herds have stranded in such  areas. Records from throughout the range suggest that the species has an  oceanic distribution.    [Illustration: Figure 92.--False killer whales at sea 600 miles (968.0  km) off northeastern Florida. Note the smoothly falcate dorsal fin,  pointed on the tip, and located near the midpoint of the back. Dorsal  fins of this species may also be rounded on the tip but all are sharply  concaved on the rear margin. (_Photo by H. E. Winn._)]    [Illustration: Figure 93.--False killer whales are the only \"blackfish\"  that routinely ride the bow waves of vessels. On this animal riding on  the bow wave of a research ship, note the all-black coloration of the  back, head, and sides and the broad \"hump\" near the middle of the  flippers on the leading edge. (_Photo 600 miles [968 km] off  northeastern Florida by H. E. Winn._)]    [Illustration: Figure 94.--A false killer whale stranded in northeastern  Florida. Note the narrow tapering head, overhanging the lower jaw by  several inches, the position and shape of the dorsal fin and the  distinctive \"hump\" on the leading margin of the flippers. (_Photo by W.  A. Huck, courtesy of Marineland of Florida._)]    [Illustration: Figure 95.--Entire herds of false killer whales sometimes  strand themselves. In this dorsal view of an animal stranded in  southeastern Florida, note the extremely distinctive \"hump\" on the  forward margin of the flippers and the narrow head, tapering towards the  tip of the snout. (_Photo by J. Krol._)]    [Illustration: Figure 96.--False killer whales have from 8 to 11 large,  conspicuous teeth in each side of each jaw. These teeth are often  visible in swimming animals, particularly when they are engaged in their  obnoxious habit of stealing fish from the lines of fishermen. The teeth  are so distinctive that they can also be used to identify even a badly  decomposed stranded specimen. (_Photo, courtesy of Sea Life Park,  Hawaii._)]          ATLANTIC PILOT WHALE (T)    _Globicephala melaena_ (Traill 1809)      Other Common Names    Northern pilot whale, long-finned pilot whale, pothead, blackfish,  calling whale, caa'ing whale.      Description    Male Atlantic pilot whales reach an average length of at least 20 feet  (6.2 m). Females are slightly smaller, probably not exceeding 18 feet  (5.5 m). Young are 5-7 feet (1.5-2.1 m) at birth.    The head is thick and bulbous, a characteristic which reaches an extreme  in the development of the head of adult males (prompting the common name  \"pothead\"). The flippers are long (to one-fifth of the body length, or  more) and sickle-shaped. The tail is dorsally thickened just in front of  the flukes.    The dorsal fin of this species is one of its most distinctive  characteristics. It is low in profile, has a long base, is set far  forward on the animal's back, and is falcate to \"flaglike\" in  appearance. The dorsal fin of adult males reportedly has a thicker  leading edge and a rounder form than that of the female.    Atlantic pilot whales are black on the back and sides (prompting the  common name \"blackfish\") but have an anchor-shaped patch of grayish  white on the chin and a gray area on the belly, both of which are  variable in extent and intensity. Some larger animals have a gray saddle  behind the dorsal fin, though this zone of color is found more  frequently in short-finned pilot whales. Young animals are often a  lighter medium gray.      Natural History Notes    Atlantic pilot whales may occur in herds of 200 animals or more, though  herds of 50 or fewer (4-6) are more common. They are sometimes found in  association with Atlantic white-sided dolphins.    Pilot whales are sometimes found hanging vertically in the water with  the head and part of the back out of the water in what has been called  \"spy-hopping\" or \"pitchpoling.\" Individuals frequently lobtail. Pilot  whales infrequently breach, a behavior which is usually confined to  younger animals. They do not ride bow waves.    Atlantic pilot whales feed primarily on squid but also take cod and  other fishes. A Pacific pilot whale, a closely related species, was  found by radio telemetric studies to be capable of diving to 2,000 feet  (609.6 m).    Atlantic pilot whales were formerly the object of an active shore  fishery off Newfoundland (1950-1971). In addition, entire herds and,  less frequently, individuals are sometimes stranded.      May Be Confused With    Atlantic pilot whales are most likely to be confused with false killer  whales, with which they share the waters from off Virginia to those off  Maryland.
