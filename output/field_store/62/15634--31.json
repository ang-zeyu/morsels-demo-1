I shall burn my boat, my best scrapbook, and all my  soldiers,\" said Demi firmly.    \"Well, I will; but it's too bad of Kitty-mouse to want our very nicest  things,\" sighed Daisy.    \"A sackerryfice means to give up what you are fond of, so we must,\"  explained Demi, to whom the new idea had been suggested by hearing  Uncle Fritz describe the customs of the Greeks to the big boys who were  reading about them in school.    \"Is Rob coming too,\" asked Daisy.    \"Yes, and he is going to bring his toy village; it is all made of wood,  you know, and will burn nicely. We'll have a grand bonfire, and see them  blaze up, won't we?\"    This brilliant prospect consoled Daisy, and she ate her dinner with a  row of paper dolls before her, as a sort of farewell banquet.    At the appointed hour the sacrificial train set forth, each child  bearing the treasures demanded by the insatiable Kitty-mouse. Teddy  insisted on going also, and seeing that all the others had toys, he  tucked a squeaking lamb under one arm, and old Annabella under the  other, little dreaming what anguish the latter idol was to give him.    \"Where are you going, my chickens?\" asked Mrs. Jo, as the flock passed  her door.    \"To play by the big rock; can't we?\"    \"Yes, only don't do near the pond, and take good care of baby.\"    \"I always do,\" said Daisy, leading forth her charge with a capable air.    \"Now, you must all sit round, and not move till I tell you. This flat  stone is an altar, and I am going to make a fire on it.\"    Demi then proceeded to kindle up a small blaze, as he had seen the boys  do at picnics. When the flame burned well, he ordered the company to  march round it three times and then stand in a circle.    \"I shall begin, and as fast as my things are burnt, you must bring  yours.\"    With that he solemnly laid on a little paper book full of pictures,  pasted in by himself; this was followed by a dilapidated boat, and  then one by one the unhappy leaden soldiers marched to death. Not one  faltered or hung back, from the splendid red and yellow captain to the  small drummer who had lost his legs; all vanished in the flames and  mingled in one common pool of melted lead.    \"Now, Daisy!\" called the high priest of Kitty-mouse, when his rich  offerings had been consumed, to the great satisfaction of the children.    \"My dear dollies, how can I let them go?\" moaned Daisy, hugging the  entire dozen with a face full of maternal woe.    \"You must,\" commanded Demi; and with a farewell kiss to each, Daisy laid  her blooming dolls upon the coals.    \"Let me keep one, the dear blue thing, she is so sweet,\" besought the  poor little mamma, clutching her last in despair.    \"More! more!\" growled an awful voice, and Demi cried, \"that's the  Kitty-mouse! she must have every one, quick, or she will scratch us.\"    In went the precious blue belle, flounces, rosy hat, and all, and  nothing but a few black flakes remained of that bright band.    \"Stand the houses and trees round, and let them catch themselves; it  will be like a real fire then,\" said Demi, who liked variety even in his  \"sackerryfices.\"    Charmed by this suggestion, the children arranged the doomed village,  laid a line of coals along the main street, and then sat down to watch  the conflagration. It was somewhat slow to kindle owing to the paint,  but at last one ambitious little cottage blazed up, fired a tree of the  palm species, which fell on to the roof of a large family mansion,  and in a few minutes the whole town was burning merrily. The wooden  population stood and stared at the destruction like blockheads, as they  were, till they also caught and blazed away without a cry. It took  some time to reduce the town to ashes, and the lookers-on enjoyed the  spectacle immensely, cheering as each house fell, dancing like wild  Indians when the steeple flamed aloft, and actually casting one wretched  little churn-shaped lady, who had escaped to the suburbs, into the very  heart of the fire.    The superb success of this last offering excited Teddy to such a degree,  that he first threw his lamb into the conflagration, and before it had  time even to roast, he planted poor Annabella on the funeral pyre. Of  course she did not like it, and expressed her anguish and resentment in  a way that terrified her infant destroyer. Being covered with kid,  she did not blaze, but did what was worse, she squirmed. First one leg  curled up, then the other, in a very awful and lifelike manner; next  she flung her arms over her head as if in great agony; her head itself  turned on her shoulders, her glass eyes fell out, and with one final  writhe of her whole body, she sank down a blackened mass on the ruins  of the town. This unexpected demonstration startled every one and  frightened Teddy half out of his little wits. He looked, then screamed  and fled toward the house, roaring \"Marmar\" at the top of his voice.    Mrs. Bhaer heard the outcry and ran to the rescue, but Teddy could only  cling to her and pour out in his broken way something about \"poor Bella  hurted,\" \"a dreat fire,\" and \"all the dollies dorn.\" Fearing some dire  mishap, his mother caught him up and hurried to the scene of action,  where she found the blind worshippers of Kitty-mouse mourning over the  charred remains of the lost darling.    \"What have you been at? Tell me all about it,\" said Mrs. Jo, composing  herself to listen patiently, for the culprits looked so penitent, she  forgave them beforehand.    With some reluctance Demi explained their play, and Aunt Jo laughed till  the tears ran down her cheeks, the children were so solemn, and the play  was so absurd.    \"I thought you were too sensible to play such a silly game as this. If  I had any Kitty-mouse I'd have a good one who liked you to play in safe  pleasant ways, and not destroy and frighten. Just see what a ruin you  have made; all Daisy's pretty dolls, Demi's soldiers, and Rob's new  village beside poor Teddy's pet lamb, and dear old Annabella. I shall  have to write up in the nursery the verse that used to come in the boxes  of toys,         \"The children of Holland take pleasure in making,       What the children of Boston take pleasure in breaking.\"    \"Only I shall put Plumfield instead of Boston.\"    \"We never will again, truly, truly!\" cried the repentant little sinners,  much abashed at this reproof.    \"Demi told us to,\" said Rob.    \"Well, I heard Uncle tell about the Greece people, who had altars  and things, and so I wanted to be like them, only I hadn't any live  creatures to sackerryfice, so we burnt up our toys.\"    \"Dear me, that is something like the bean story,\" said Aunt Jo, laughing  again.    \"Tell about it,\" suggested Daisy, to change the subject.    \"Once there was a poor woman who had three or four little children, and  she used to lock them up in her room when she went out to work, to keep  them safe. On day when she was going away she said, 'Now, my dears,  don't let baby fall out of window, don't play with the matches, and  don't put beans up your noses.' Now the children had never dreamed of  doing that last thing, but she put it into their heads, and the minute  she was gone, they ran and stuffed their naughty little noses full of  beans, just to see how it felt, and she found them all crying when she  came home.\"    \"Did it hurt?\" asked Rob, with such intense interest that his mother  hastily added a warning sequel, lest a new edition of the bean story  should appear in her own family.    \"Very much, as I know, for when my mother told me this story, I was so  silly that I went and tried it myself. I had no beans, so I took some  little pebbles, and poked several into my nose. I did not like it at  all, and wanted to take them out again very soon, but one would not  come, and I was so ashamed to tell what a goose I been that I went for  hours with the stone hurting me very much. At last the pain got so bad  I had to tell, and when my mother could not get it out the doctor came.  Then I was put in a chair and held tight, Rob, while he used his ugly  little pincers till the stone hopped out. Dear me! how my wretched  little nose did ache, and how people laughed at me!\" and Mrs. Jo shook  her head in a dismal way, as if the memory of her sufferings was too  much for her.    Rob looked deeply impressed and I am glad to say took the warning to  heart. Demi proposed that they should bury poor Annabella, and in the  interest of the funeral Teddy forgot his fright. Daisy was soon consoled  by another batch of dolls from Aunt Amy, and the Naughty Kitty-mouse  seemed to be appeased by the last offerings, for she tormented them no  more.    \"Brops\" was the name of a new and absorbing play, invented by Bangs.  As this interesting animal is not to be found in any Zoological Garden,  unless Du Chaillu has recently brought one from the wilds of Africa, I  will mention a few of its peculiar habits and traits, for the benefit of  inquiring minds. The Brop is a winged quadruped, with a human face of  a youthful and merry aspect. When it walks the earth it grunts, when it  soars it gives a shrill hoot, occasionally it goes erect, and talks good  English. Its body is usually covered with a substance much resembling a  shawl, sometimes red, sometimes blue, often plaid, and, strange to say,  they frequently change skins with one another. On their heads they have  a horn very like a stiff brown paper lamp-lighter. Wings of the same  substance flap upon their shoulders when they fly; this is never very  far from the ground, as they usually fall with violence if they attempt  any lofty flights. They browse over the earth, but can sit up and eat  like the squirrel. Their favorite nourishment is the seed-cake; apples  also are freely taken, and sometimes raw carrots are nibbled when food  is scarce. They live in dens,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27887"],[0,"Wild Animals at Home (#20)"],[1," It is a surprising fact that though we spent two weeks in this  valley, and a month in those mountains, we did not see another wild  Rabbit.    This incident is unique in my experience. It is the only time when I  found the Snowshoe Hares gathered for a social purpose, and is the only  approach to a game that I ever heard of among them.      THE GHOST RABBIT    An entirely different side of Rabbit life is seen in another mysterious  incident that I have never been able to explain.    At one time when I lived in Ontario, I had a very good hound that was  trained to follow all kinds of trails. I used to take him out in the  woods at night, give him general instructions \"to go ahead, and report  everything afoot\"; then sit down on a log to listen to his reports. And  he made them with remarkable promptness. Slight differences in his bark,  and the course taken, enabled me to tell at once whether it was Fox,  Coon, Rabbit, Skunk, or other local game. And his peculiar falsetto yelp  when the creature treed, was a joyful invitation to \"come and see for  yourself.\"    [Illustration]    The hound's bark for a Fox was deep, strong, and at regular intervals as  befitted the strong trail, and the straightaway run. But for a Rabbit  it was broken, uncertain, irregular and rarely a good deep bay.    [Illustration]    One night the dog bawled in his usual way, \"Rabbit, Rabbit, Rabbit,\" and  soon leaving the woods he crossed an open field where the moon shone  brightly, and I could easily see to follow. Still yelping \"Rabbit,  Rabbit, Rabbit,\" he dashed into a bramble thicket in the middle of the  field. But at once he dashed out again shrieking, \"Police! Help!  Murder!\" and took refuge behind me, cowering up against my legs. At the  same moment from the side of that bramble thicket there went out--_a  Rabbit_. Yes, a common Rabbit all right, but it was a _snow-white_ one.  The first albino Cottontail I had ever seen, and apparently the first  albino Cottontail that[C] Ranger had ever seen. Dogs are not supposed to  be superstitious, but on that occasion Ranger behaved exactly as though  he thought that he had seen a ghost.      A NARROW-GAUGE MULE--THE PRAIRIE HARE    [Illustration]    One has to see this creature with its great flopping ears, and its  stiff-legged jumping like a bucking mule, to realize the aptness of its  Western nickname.    As it bounds away from your pathway its bushy snow-white tail and the  white behind the black-tipped ears will point out plainly that it is  neither the Texas Jackrabbit nor the Rocky Mountain Cottontail, but the  White-tailed Jackrabbit, the finest of all our Hares.    I have met it in woods, mountains, and prairies, from California to  Manitoba and found it the wildest of its race and almost impossible of  approach; _except_ in the great exceptional spot, the Yellowstone Park.  Here in the August of 1912 I met with two, close to the Mammoth Hot  Springs Hotel. At a distance of thirty feet they gave me good chances to  take pictures, and though the light was very bad I made a couple of  snaps. Fifteen years ago, when first I roamed in the Park, the Prairie  Hare was exceedingly rare, but now, like so many of the wild folk, it  has become quite common. Another evidence of the efficacy of protection.    This silvery-gray creature turns pure white in the winter, when the snow  mantle of his range might otherwise make it too conspicuous.      THE BUMP OF MOSS THAT SQUEAKS    No matter how horrible a certain climate or surroundings may seem to us,  they are sure to be the ideal of some wild creature, its very dream of  bliss. I suppose that slide rock, away up in cold, bleak, windy country  above the timber-line, is absolutely the unloveliest landscape and most  repulsive home ground that a man could find in the mountains and yet it  is the paradise, the perfect place of a wonderful little creature that  is found on the high peaks of the Rockies from California to Alaska.    It is not especially abundant in the Yellowstone Park, but it was there  that first I made its acquaintance, and Easterners will meet with it in  the great Reserve more often than in all other parts of its range put  together.    [Illustration]    As one reaches the Golden Gate, near Mammoth Hot Springs, many little  animals of the Ground-squirrel group are seen running about, and from  the distance comes a peculiar cry, a short squeak uttered every ten or  fifteen seconds. You stop, perhaps search with your eye the remote  hillside, but you are looking too far afield. Glance toward the tumbled  rock piles, look at every high point. There on top of one you note a  little gray lump, like a bump of moss, the size of your fist, clinging  to the point of the rock. Fix your glasses on it, and you will see  plainly that the squeak is made by this tiny creature, like a  quarter-grown Rabbit with short, round, white-rimmed ears and no  visible tail. This is the curious little animal that cannot be happy  anywhere but in the slide rock; this is the Calling Hare. \"Little Chief  Hare\" is its Indian name, but it has many others of much currency, such  as \"Pika,\" and \"Starved Rat,\" the latter because it is never fat. The  driver calls it a \"Coney,\" or \"Rock Rabbit.\" In its colour, size, shape,  and habits it differs from all other creatures in the region; it is  impossible to mistake it. Though a distant kinsman of the Rabbits, it is  unlike them in looks and ways. Thus it has, as noted, the very  un-rabbit-like habit of squeaking from some high lookout. This is  doubtless a call of alarm to let the rest of the company know that there  is danger about, for the Coney is a gregarious creature; there may be a  hundred of them in the rock-slide.    Some years ago, in Colorado, I sketched one of the Coneys by help of a  field glass. He was putting all the force of his energetic little soul  into the utterance of an alarm cry for the benefit of his people.    But the most interesting habit of this un-rabbity Rabbit is its way of  preparing for winter.    [Illustration]    When the grass, the mountain dandelions, and the peavines are at their  best growth for making hay, the Coney, with his kind, goes warily from  his stronghold in the rocks to the nearest stretch of herbage, and there  cuts as much as he can carry of the richest growths; then laden with a  bundle as big as himself, and very much longer, he makes for the rocks,  and on some flat open place spreads the herbage out to be cured for his  winter hay. Out in full blaze of the sun he leave it, and if some  inconsiderate rock comes in between, to cast a shadow on his hay  a-curing, he moves the one that is easiest to move; he never neglects  his hay. When dry enough to be safe, he packs it away into his barn, the  barn being a sheltered crevice in the rocks where the weather cannot  harm it, and where it will continue good until the winter time, when  otherwise there would be a sad pinch of famine in the Coney world. The  trappers say that they can tell whether the winter will be hard or open  by the amount of food stored up in the Coney barns.    [Illustration]    Many a one of these I have examined in the mountains of British Columbia  and Colorado, as well as in the Park. The quantity of hay in them varies  from what might fill a peck measure to what would make a huge armful.  Among the food plants used, I found many species of grass, thistle,  meadow-rue, peavine, heath, and the leaves of several composite plants.  I suspect that fuller observations will show that they use every herb  not actually poisonous, that grows in the vicinity of their citadel.  More than one of these wads of hay had in the middle of it a nest or  hollow; not, I suspect, the home nest where the young are raised, but a  sort of winter restaurant where they could go while the ground was  covered with snow, and sitting in the midst of their provisions, eat to  their heart's content.    It is not unlikely that in this we see the growth of the storage habit,  beginning first with a warm nest of hay, which it was found could be  utilized for food when none other was available. The fact that these  barns are used year after year is shown by the abundance of pellets in  several layers which were found in and about them.      THE WEATHERWISE CONEY    [Illustration]    A very wise little people is this little people of the Rocks. Not only  do they realize that in summer they must prepare for winter, but they  know how to face a present crisis, however unexpected. To appreciate the  following instance, we must remember that the central thought in the  Coney's life is his \"grub pile\" for winter use, and next that he is a  strictly daytime animal. I have often slept near a Coney settlement and  never heard a sound or seen a sign of their being about after dark.  Nevertheless, Merriam tells us that he and Vernon Bailey once carried  their blankets up to a Coney colony above timber-line in the Salmon  River Mountains of Idaho, intending to spend the night there and to  study the Coneys whose piles of hay were visible in all directions on  their rocks. As this was about the first of September, it was natural to  expect fair weather and a complete curing of the hay in a week or so.  But a fierce storm set in with the descending night. The rain changed to  hail and then to snow, and much to the surprise of the naturalists, they  heard the squeak of the Coneys all night long.    These animals love the sunshine, the warmth and the daylight, and dread  cold and darkness as much as we do. It must have been a bitter  experience when at the call of the older ones every little Coney had to  tumble out of his warm bed in the chill black hours and face the driving  sleet to save the winter's supplies. But tumble out they did, and  overtime they worked, hard and well, for when the morning dawned the  slide-rock and the whole world was covered deep in snow, but every  haycock had been removed to a safer place under the rocks,"]]]
