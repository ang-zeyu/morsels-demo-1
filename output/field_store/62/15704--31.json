If your heart is as big as your body, and  your soul as fine as your face, then I'd ask for nothing better,\" said  McMurdo.    \"By Gar! you've got an Irish tongue in your head anyhow,\" cried the  saloon-keeper, not quite certain whether to humour this audacious  visitor or to stand upon his dignity.    \"So you are good enough to pass my appearance?\"    \"Sure,\" said McMurdo.    \"And you were told to see me?\"    \"I was.\"    \"And who told you?\"    \"Brother Scanlan of Lodge 341, Vermissa. I drink your health Councillor,  and to our better acquaintance.\" He raised a glass with which he had  been served to his lips and elevated his little finger as he drank it.    McGinty, who had been watching him narrowly, raised his thick black  eyebrows. \"Oh, it's like that, is it?\" said he. \"I'll have to look a bit  closer into this, Mister--\"    \"McMurdo.\"    \"A bit closer, Mr. McMurdo; for we don't take folk on trust in these  parts, nor believe all we're told neither. Come in here for a moment,  behind the bar.\"    There was a small room there, lined with barrels. McGinty carefully  closed the door, and then seated himself on one of them, biting  thoughtfully on his cigar and surveying his companion with those  disquieting eyes. For a couple of minutes he sat in complete silence.  McMurdo bore the inspection cheerfully, one hand in his coat pocket,  the other twisting his brown moustache. Suddenly McGinty stooped and  produced a wicked-looking revolver.    \"See here, my joker,\" said he, \"if I thought you were playing any game  on us, it would be short work for you.\"    \"This is a strange welcome,\" McMurdo answered with some dignity, \"for  the Bodymaster of a lodge of Freemen to give to a stranger brother.\"    \"Ay, but it's just that same that you have to prove,\" said McGinty, \"and  God help you if you fail! Where were you made?\"    \"Lodge 29, Chicago.\"    \"When?\"    \"June 24, 1872.\"    \"What Bodymaster?\"    \"James H. Scott.\"    \"Who is your district ruler?\"    \"Bartholomew Wilson.\"    \"Hum! You seem glib enough in your tests. What are you doing here?\"    \"Working, the same as you--but a poorer job.\"    \"You have your back answer quick enough.\"    \"Yes, I was always quick of speech.\"    \"Are you quick of action?\"    \"I have had that name among those that knew me best.\"    \"Well, we may try you sooner than you think. Have you heard anything of  the lodge in these parts?\"    \"I've heard that it takes a man to be a brother.\"    \"True for you, Mr. McMurdo. Why did you leave Chicago?\"    \"I'm damned if I tell you that!\"    McGinty opened his eyes. He was not used to being answered in such  fashion, and it amused him. \"Why won't you tell me?\"    \"Because no brother may tell another a lie.\"    \"Then the truth is too bad to tell?\"    \"You can put it that way if you like.\"    \"See here, mister, you can't expect me, as Bodymaster, to pass into the  lodge a man for whose past he can't answer.\"    McMurdo looked puzzled. Then he took a worn newspaper cutting from an  inner pocket.    \"You wouldn't squeal on a fellow?\" said he.    \"I'll wipe my hand across your face if you say such words to me!\" cried  McGinty hotly.    \"You are right, Councillor,\" said McMurdo meekly. \"I should apologize.  I spoke without thought. Well, I know that I am safe in your hands. Look  at that clipping.\"    McGinty glanced his eyes over the account of the shooting of one Jonas  Pinto, in the Lake Saloon, Market Street, Chicago, in the New Year week  of 1874.    \"Your work?\" he asked, as he handed back the paper.    McMurdo nodded.    \"Why did you shoot him?\"    \"I was helping Uncle Sam to make dollars. Maybe mine were not as good  gold as his, but they looked as well and were cheaper to make. This man  Pinto helped me to shove the queer--\"    \"To do what?\"    \"Well, it means to pass the dollars out into circulation. Then he said  he would split. Maybe he did split. I didn't wait to see. I just killed  him and lighted out for the coal country.\"    \"Why the coal country?\"    \"'Cause I'd read in the papers that they weren't too particular in those  parts.\"    McGinty laughed. \"You were first a coiner and then a murderer, and you  came to these parts because you thought you'd be welcome.\"    \"That's about the size of it,\" McMurdo answered.    \"Well, I guess you'll go far. Say, can you make those dollars yet?\"    McMurdo took half a dozen from his pocket. \"Those never passed the  Philadelphia mint,\" said he.    \"You don't say!\" McGinty held them to the light in his enormous hand,  which was hairy as a gorilla's. \"I can see no difference. Gar! you'll be  a mighty useful brother, I'm thinking! We can do with a bad man or two  among us, Friend McMurdo: for there are times when we have to take our  own part. We'd soon be against the wall if we didn't shove back at those  that were pushing us.\"    \"Well, I guess I'll do my share of shoving with the rest of the boys.\"    \"You seem to have a good nerve. You didn't squirm when I shoved this gun  at you.\"    \"It was not me that was in danger.\"    \"Who then?\"    \"It was you, Councillor.\" McMurdo drew a cocked pistol from the side  pocket of his peajacket. \"I was covering you all the time. I guess my  shot would have been as quick as yours.\"    \"By Gar!\" McGinty flushed an angry red and then burst into a roar of  laughter. \"Say, we've had no such holy terror come to hand this many a  year. I reckon the lodge will learn to be proud of you.... Well, what  the hell do you want? And can't I speak alone with a gentleman for five  minutes but you must butt in on us?\"    The bartender stood abashed. \"I'm sorry, Councillor, but it's Ted  Baldwin. He says he must see you this very minute.\"    The message was unnecessary; for the set, cruel face of the man himself  was looking over the servant's shoulder. He pushed the bartender out and  closed the door on him.    \"So,\" said he with a furious glance at McMurdo, \"you got here first, did  you? I've a word to say to you, Councillor, about this man.\"    \"Then say it here and now before my face,\" cried McMurdo.    \"I'll say it at my own time, in my own way.\"    \"Tut! Tut!\" said McGinty, getting off his barrel. \"This will never do.  We have a new brother here, Baldwin, and it's not for us to greet him in  such fashion. Hold out your hand, man, and make it up!\"    \"Never!\" cried Baldwin in a fury.    \"I've offered to fight him if he thinks I have wronged him,\" said  McMurdo. \"I'll fight him with fists, or, if that won't satisfy him,  I'll fight him any other way he chooses. Now, I'll leave it to you,  Councillor, to judge between us as a Bodymaster should.\"    \"What is it, then?\"    \"A young lady. She's free to choose for herself.\"    \"Is she?\" cried Baldwin.    \"As between two brothers of the lodge I should say that she was,\" said  the Boss.    \"Oh, that's your ruling, is it?\"    \"Yes, it is, Ted Baldwin,\" said McGinty, with a wicked stare. \"Is it you  that would dispute it?\"    \"You would throw over one that has stood by you this five years in  favour of a man that you never saw before in your life? You're not  Bodymaster for life, Jack McGinty, and by God! when next it comes to a  vote--\"    The Councillor sprang at him like a tiger. His hand closed round the  other's neck, and he hurled him back across one of the barrels. In his  mad fury he would have squeezed the life out of him if McMurdo had not  interfered.    \"Easy, Councillor! For heaven's sake, go easy!\" he cried, as he dragged  him back.    McGinty released his hold, and Baldwin, cowed and shaken gasping for  breath, and shivering in every limb, as one who has looked over the very  edge of death, sat up on the barrel over which he had been hurled.    \"You've been asking for it this many a day, Ted Baldwin--now you've got  it!\" cried McGinty, his huge chest rising and falling. \"Maybe you think  if I was voted down from Bodymaster you would find yourself in my shoes.  It's for the lodge to say that. But so long as I am the chief I'll have  no man lift his voice against me or my rulings.\"    \"I have nothing against you,\" mumbled Baldwin, feeling his throat.    \"Well, then,\" cried the other, relapsing in a moment into a bluff  joviality, \"we are all good friends again and there's an end of the  matter.\"    He took a bottle of champagne down from the shelf and twisted out the  cork.    \"See now,\" he continued, as he filled three high glasses. \"Let us drink  the quarrelling toast of the lodge. After that, as you know, there can  be no bad blood between us. Now, then the left hand on the apple of my  throat. I say to you, Ted Baldwin, what is the offense, sir?\"    \"The clouds are heavy,\" answered Baldwin    \"But they will forever brighten.\"    \"And this I swear!\"    The men drank their glasses, and the same ceremony was performed between  Baldwin and McMurdo    \"There!\" cried McGinty, rubbing his hands. \"That's the end of the black  blood. You come under lodge discipline if it goes further, and that's  a heavy hand in these parts, as Brother Baldwin knows--and as you will  damn soon find out, Brother McMurdo, if you ask for trouble!\"    \"Faith, I'd be slow to do that,\" said McMurdo. He held out his hand to  Baldwin. \"I'm quick to quarrel and quick to forgive. It's my hot Irish  blood, they tell me. But it's over for me, and I bear no grudge.\"    Baldwin had to take the proffered hand; for the baleful eye of the  terrible Boss was upon him. But his sullen face showed how little the  words of the other had moved him.    McGinty clapped them both on the shoulders. \"Tut! These girls! These  girls!\" he cried. \"To think that the same petticoats should come between  two of my boys! It's the devil's own luck! Well, it's the colleen inside  of them that must settle the question; for it's outside the jurisdiction  of a Bodymaster--and the Lord be praised for that!

You'll have to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3291"],[0,"John Marshall and the Constitution, a Chronicle of the Supreme Court (#20)"],[1,"nced--all by legislative mandate. Since that day the courts have  developed an interpretation of the principle of the separation of powers  and have enunciated a theory of \"due process of law,\" which renders  this sort of legislative abuse quite impossible; but in 1787, though the  principle of the separation of powers had received verbal recognition  in several of the state Constitutions, no one as yet knew precisely what  the term \"legislative power\" signified, and at that time judicial  review did not exist. * * Hence those who wished to see this nuisance  of special legislation abated felt not unnaturally that the relief  must come from some source external to the local governments, and they  welcomed the movement for a new national Constitution as affording them  their opportunity.       * See supra, Chapter II.       * * On special legislation, see the writer's \"Doctrine of Judicial  Review\" (Princeton, 1914), pp. 36-37, 69-71.      The Constitution, in Article I, Section X, forbids the States to \"emit  bills of credit, make anything but gold and silver a legal tender in  payment of debts, pass any bill of attainder, ex post facto law, or  law impairing the obligation of contracts.\" Until 1798, the provision  generally regarded as offering the most promising weapon against special  legislation was the ex post facto clause. In that year, however, in its  decision in Calder vs. Bull the Court held that this clause \"was not  inserted to secure the citizen in his private rights of either property  or contracts,\" but only against certain kinds of penal legislation. The  decision roused sharp criticism and the judges themselves seemed fairly  to repent of it even in handing it down. Justice Chase, indeed, even  went so far as to suggest, as a sort of stop-gap to the breach they were  thus creating in the Constitution, the idea that, even in the absence of  written constitutional restrictions, the Social Compact as well as  \"the principles of our free republican governments\" afforded judicially  enforcible limitations upon legislative power in favor of private  rights. Then, in the years immediately following, several state courts,  building upon this dictum, had definitely announced their intention  of treating as void all legislation which they found unduly to disturb  vested rights, especially if it was confined in its operation to  specified parties. *       * In connection with this paragraph, see the writer's article  entitled \"The Basic Doctrine of American Constitutional Law,\" in  the \"Michigan Law Review,\" February, 1914. Marshall once wrote Story  regarding his attitude toward Section X in 1787, as follows: \"The  questions which were perpetually recurring in the State legislatures  and which brought annually into doubt principles which I thought most  sacred, which proved that everything was afloat, and that we had no safe  anchorage ground, gave a high value in my estimation to that article of  the Constitution which imposes restrictions on the States.\" \"Discourse.\"      Such was still the situation when the case of Fletcher vs. Peck * in  1810 raised before the Supreme Court the question whether the Georgia  Legislature had the right to rescind a land grant made by a preceding  Legislature. On any of three grounds Marshall might easily have disposed  of this case before coming to the principal question. In the first  place, it was palpably a moot case; that is to say, it was to the  interest of the opposing parties to have the rescinding act set aside.  The Court would not today take jurisdiction of such a case, but Marshall  does not even suggest such a solution of the question, though Justice  Johnson does in his concurring opinion. In the second place, Georgia's  own claim to the lands had been most questionable, and consequently her  right to grant them to others was equally dubious; but this, too, is  an issue which Marshall avoids. Finally, the grant had been procured by  corrupt means, but Marshall ruled that this was not a subject the Court  might enter upon; and for the ordinary run of cases in which undue  influence is alleged to have induced the enactment of a law, the ruling  is clearly sound. But this was no ordinary case. The fraud asserted  against the grant was a matter of universal notoriety; it was, indeed,  the most resounding scandal of the generation; and surely judges may  assume to know what is known to all and may act upon their knowledge.       * 6 Cranch, 87.      Furthermore, when one turns to the part of Marshall's opinion which  deals with the constitutional issue, one finds not a little evidence of  personal predilection on the part of the Chief Justice. He starts out  by declaring the rescinding act void as a violation of vested rights, of  the underlying principles of society and government, and of the doctrine  of the separation of powers. Then he apparently realizes that a decision  based on such grounds must be far less secure and much less generally  available than one based on the words of the Constitution; whereupon he  brings forward the obligation of contracts clause. At once, however, he  is confronted with the difficulty that the obligation of a contract is  the obligation of a contract still to be fulfilled, and that a grant  is an executed contract over and done with--functus officio. This  difficulty he meets by asserting that every grant is attended by an  implied contract on the part of the grantor not to reassert his right to  the thing granted. This, of course, is a palpable fiction on Marshall's  part, though certainly not an unreasonable one. For undoubtedly when a  grant is made without stipulation to the contrary, both parties assume  that it will be permanent.    The greater difficulty arose from the fact that, whether implied or  explicit, the contract before the Court was a PUBLIC one. In the case of  private contracts it is easy enough to distinguish the contract, as the  agreement between the parties, from the obligation of the contract which  comes from the law and holds the parties to their engagements. But what  law was there to hold Georgia to her supposed agreement not to rescind  the grant she had made? Not the Constitution of the United States  unattended by any other law, since it protects the obligation only after  it has come into existence. Not the Constitution of Georgia as construed  by her own courts, since they had sustained the rescinding act. Only one  possibility remained; the State Constitution must be the source of the  obligation--yes; but the State Constitution as it was construed by  the United States Supreme Court in this very case, in the light of  the \"general principles of our political institutions.\" In short the  obligation is a moral one; and this moral obligation is treated by  Marshall as having been converted into a legal one by the United States  Constitution.    However, Marshall apparently fails to find entire satisfaction in  this argument, for he next turns to the prohibition against bills  of attainder and ex post facto laws with a question which manifests  disapproval of the decision in Calder vs. Bull. Yet he hesitates to  overrule Calder vs. Bull, and, indeed, even at the very end of his  opinion he still declines to indicate clearly the basis of his decision.  The State of Georgia, he says, \"was restrained\" from the passing of the  rescinding act \"either by general principles which are common to our  free institutions, or by particular provisions of the Constitution of  the United States.\" It was not until nine years after Fletcher vs. Peck  that this ambiguity was cleared up in the Dartmouth College case in  1819.    The case of the Trustees of Dartmouth College vs. Woodward * was a New  England product and redolent of the soil from which it sprang. In 1754  the Reverend Eleazar Wheelock of Connecticut had established at his  own expense a charity school for instructing Indians in the Christian  religion; and so great was his success that he felt encouraged to extend  the undertaking and to solicit donations in England. Again success  rewarded his efforts; and in 1769 Governor Wentworth of New Hampshire,  George III's representative granted the new institution, which was now  located at Hanover, New Hampshire, a charter incorporating twelve named  persons as \"The Trustees of Dartmouth College\" with the power to govern  the institution, appoint its officers, and fill all vacancies in their  own body \"forever.\"       * The following account of this case is based on J. M. Shirley's  \"Dartmouth College Causes\" (St. Louis, 1879) and on the official report,  4 Wheaton, 518.      For many years after the Revolution, the Trustees of Dartmouth  College, several of whom were ministers, reflected the spirit of  Congregationalism. Though this form of worship occupied almost the  position of a state religion in New Hampshire, early in this period  difficulties arose in the midst of the church at Hanover. A certain  Samuel Hayes, or Haze, told a woman named Rachel Murch that her  character was \"as black as Hell,\" and upon Rachel's complaint to the  session, he was \"churched\" for \"breach of the Ninth Commandment and also  for a violation of his covenant agreement.\" This incident caused a rift  which gradually developed into something very like a schism in the local  congregation, and this internal disagreement finally produced a split  between Eleazar's son, Dr. John Wheelock, who was now president of  Dartmouth College, and the Trustees of the institution. The result was  that in August, 1815, the Trustees ousted Wheelock.    The quarrel had thus far involved only Calvinists and Federalists, but  in 1816 a new element was brought in by the interference of the Governor  of New Hampshire, William Plumer, formerly a Federalist but now, since  1812, the leader of the Jeffersonian party in the State. In a message  to the Legislature dated June 6, 1816, Plumer drew the attention of that  body to Dartmouth College. \"Al"]]]
