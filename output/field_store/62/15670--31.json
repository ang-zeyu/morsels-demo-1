During this time the  parasite larva hastily descends the abdominal hairs and allows itself  to fall on the egg of the _Anthophora_, to be then borne upon it as  upon a raft; its fall must take place at the precise instant which  will enable it to embark without falling into the honey, in which just  now it would be glued fast, and perish. This series of circumstances  results only in the introduction of a single _Sitaris_ into a chamber;  the moment which must be profited by is too short for many of them to  seize. If the female _Anthophora_ carries others hidden in her hairs,  they are obliged to await a new hatching to let themselves glide off.  Thus enclosed with the egg of the _Anthophora_ and its provision of  honey, the larva has no other rival to fear, and may alone utilise the  whole store. This parasitism has to such an extent become a habit with  the species, that the larva's organisation has become modified by it.  At the moment when it falls into the cell it cannot feed on honey. It  is indispensable for its development that it should first devour the  egg on which it floats; it can at this period be nourished by no other  food. In acting in this way it also frees itself from a voracious  being who would require much food. This first repast lasts about eight  days, at the end of which it undergoes a moult, takes another form,  and begins to float on the honey, gradually devouring it, for at this  stage it becomes able to assimilate honey. Slowly its development is  completed, with extremely interesting details with which we need not  now concern ourselves. The larva of _Sitaris_ is then in conditions  exceptionally favourable for growth; but, in spite of appearances,  there is no reason for admiring the marvellous foresight and  extraordinary sureness of instinct; nearly everything depends on a  fortuitous circumstance, a chance. This becomes very evident if we  study another related beetle; it is called the _Sitaris colletis_, and  lives at the expense of the hymenopterous _Colletes_, as its relative  at the expense of the _Anthophora_. But these two species of the same  genus are very unequally aided by chance. The one whose history we  have just traced attaches itself to an insect whose egg floats above a  store of honey; the second chooses a victim who attaches its egg to  the walls of a chamber. (Fig. 15.) This almost insignificant  difference has a considerable influence on the parasite's evolution.  In the first case it is alone, and may develop with certainty; in the  second, on the contrary, several _Sitaris_ penetrate the chamber and  climb up to attack the egg, which in this case also must be their  first food. This rivalry causes a struggle to the death. If one of the  larvae is notably more vigorous than its rivals, it may free itself  from them and survive. Let us consider the fate in store for the two  species. The first is much more favoured, since a happy chance permits  each germ to produce an individual; in the second, each individual  which completes its evolution deprives several of its brothers of  life. And even this only happens in the most favourable cases, for it  may be that not one _Sitaris_ in the chamber may reach the adult  state. If the first arrival begins to absorb the egg of the  _Colletes_, a second hungry one may kill it in the midst of its repast  and take its place. But the conqueror finds the provisions already  reduced and insufficient to enable it to reach the moulting stage, at  the end of which it could profit by the honey. Ill-nourished and  weakened, it cannot support this crisis, and its corpse falls beside  that of its fellow whom it had sacrificed. Three or four parasites may  thus succeed to the same feast, and the victory of the last is useless  to him. His first struggle for life and his first triumph are followed  by irreparable defeat. These two examples show very well how a slight  difference may favour a species, and how a happy quality is capable of  being perpetuated by heredity, since by its very nature it is destined  to be extended to more numerous beings.

[Illustration: FIG. 16.]    _Carcasses of animals stored up._--These insects lay up for their  offspring stores manufactured by themselves or by others. The class we  are now about to consider makes provision of animals either dead or in  a torpid condition, with more or less art and more or less sure  instinct. Most people have seen the _Necrophorus_ or Burying Beetle  working in fields or gardens. These are large Coleoptera who feed on  abandoned carrion; everything is good to them--bodies of small  mammals, birds, or frogs; they are very easy to please, and as long as  the beast is dead that is all they require. When they have found such  remains, and consider only how to satisfy their hunger, they do not  take much trouble, and gnaw the prey on the spot where they have found  it. They are not alone at the feast, and in spite of their diligence  numerous rivals come up to dispute it; it is necessary to share with a  great number of noisy and voracious flies and insects. In the adult  state they come out well from this competition; but as good parents  they wish to save their larvae from it, as in a feeble condition these  might suffer severely. They desire to lay up a carcass for their young  alone, and with this object they bury it in the earth. The eggs also  which will thus develop in the soil have more chance of escaping  destruction by various insectivorous animals. If these diggers find a  rat (Fig. 16) or a dead bird, three or four unite their efforts, glide  beneath it, and dig with immense activity, kicking away with their  hind legs the earth withdrawn from the hole. They do not pause, and  their work soon perceptibly advances. The rat gradually sinks in the  pit as it grows deeper. When they have the good fortune to find the  earth soft they can sink the prey in less than two hours to a depth of  thirty centimetres. At this level they stop, and throw back into the  hole the earth they have dug out, carefully smoothing the hillock  which covers the grave. Thus stored up, the carcass is ready to  receive the _Necrophorus_ eggs. The females enter the soil and lay on  the buried mammal; then they retire, satisfied to leave their little  ones, when they appear, face to face with such abundant nourishment.  When they emerge from the envelope the young larvae find themselves in  the presence of this stored food, which has been softened by  putrefaction and rendered more easy of digestion. If the treasure has  not fallen on a spot easy to dig, the _Necrophorus_ quickly recognise  the fact, and do not waste time in useless labour. Endowed with  considerable strength relatively to their size, three or four of them  creep beneath the prey, and co-ordinating their efforts they transport  it several metres off to a spot which they know by experience to be  suitable for their labours. It may happen that soft earth is too far  away, and transport becoming too difficult a task, they renounce it.  But as good food should never be wasted, they utilise it by feeding  themselves, awaiting a more manageable god-send for their offspring.    Many observers have studied these beetles, and all are surprised at  their sagacity, and the way in which their various operations are  adapted to circumstances; genuine reflection governs their acts, which  are always combined to produce a definite effect.    _Provision of paralysed living animals._--It is unnecessary to say how  much better it would be for the young larva to have at its disposal  instead of a carcass a living animal, but paralysed and rendered  motionless by some method. It is difficult to believe the thing  possible, yet nothing is better established. There is a hymenopterous  relative of the Wasp called the _Sphex_. Instead of laying up honey  they store animal provisions for their larvae. Fabre has studied one of  them, the _Sphex flavipennis_.[72] It is in September that this wasp  lays her eggs; during this month to shelter her little ones she  hollows out a dozen burrows and provisions them. She has then to  devote about three days' work to each of them, for there is much to  do, as may be imagined. For each of these hiding-places the _Sphex_  first pierces a horizontal gallery about two or three inches long;  then she bends it obliquely so that it penetrates deeply into the  earth, and it is again continued in this direction for about three  inches. At the end of this passage three or four chambers are made,  usually three; each of these is meant to receive one egg. The insect  interrupts its mining task, not forming the three chambers  consecutively; when the first is completed she provisions it--we shall  soon see in what manner--and lays an egg there; then she blocks it up,  suppressing all communication between this cell and the gallery; this  done she bores a second passage, provisions it, and lays another egg,  closes up the orifice, and proceeds to prepare the third. This work is  pushed on with great activity, and when completed the _Sphex_ entirely  fills up the subterranean passage, and completely isolates the hope of  the race at a depth sufficient to shelter it well. A last precaution  is taken: before leaving, the rubbish in front of the obstructed  opening is cleared away, and every trace of the operation disappears.  The nest is then definitely abandoned, and another one prepared.       [72] \"Etude sur l'instinct et les metamorphoses des          Sphegiens,\" _Ann. Sci. Nat._, 1856.

While the  sap was running freely, the pot had to be kept boiling uniformly and  the thickening sap kept skimmed clean of the creaming scum; and  therefore, during the season, some one had to be always living in the  camp.    Dave Stone had built his camp at an opening in the woods, in such a  position that, from its own little window in the rear, he could look  out across the wide valley of the \"Tin Kittle\" to a rigid grove of  firs behind which, shielded from the nor'easters, lay his low frame  house, and red-doored barn, and wide, liberal sheds. The distance was  only about three miles, or less, from the house to the sugar-camp. But  Dave Stone was terribly proud of the prosperous little homestead which  he had carved for himself out of the unbroken wilderness on the upper  \"Tin Kittle,\" and more than proud of the slim, gray-eyed wife and  three sturdy youngsters to whom that homestead gave happy shelter. On  the spring nights when he had to stay over at the camp, he liked to be  able to see the grove that hid his home.    It chanced one afternoon, just in the height of the sap-running, that  Dave Stone was called suddenly in to the settlement on a piece of  business that could not wait overnight. A note which he had endorsed  for a friend had been allowed to go to protest, and Dave was excited.    \"Ther' ain't nothin' fer it, Mandy,\" said he, \"but fer ye to take the  baby an' go right over to the camp fer the night, an' keep an eye on  this bilin'.\"    \"But, father,\" protested his wife, in a doubtful voice, \"how kin I  leave Lidy an' Joe here alone?\"    \"Oh, there ain't nothin' goin' to bother _them_, an' Lidy 'most ten  year old!\" insisted Dave, who was in a hurry. \"Don't fret, mother.  I'll be back long afore mornin'!\"    As the children had no objection to being left, Mrs. Stone suffered  herself to be persuaded. In fact, she went to her new duty with a  certain zest, as a break in the monotony of her days. She had lent a  hand often enough at the sugar-making to be familiar with the task  awaiting her, and it was with an unwonted gaiety that she set out on  what appeared to her almost in the light of a little adventure.    But it was later than she had intended when she actually got away, the  baby crowing joyously on her arm, and the children calling gay  good-byes to her from the open door. Jake, the big brown retriever,  tried to follow her; and when she ordered him back to stay with the  children, he obeyed with a whimpering reluctance that came near  rebellion. As she descended the valley, her feet sinking in the snow  of the thawing trail, she wondered why the dog, which had always  preferred the children, should have grown so anxious to be with her.    When she reached the camp, she was already tired, but the pleasant  excitement was still upon her. When she had skimmed the big,  slow-bubbling pot of syrup, tested a ladleful of it in the snow,  poured in some fresh sap, and replenished the sluggish fire, dusk was  already stealing upon the forest. In her haste she did not notice that  the candle in the old lantern was almost burned out. Snatching up the  lantern, which it was not yet necessary to light, and the big tin  sap-bucket, and giving the baby, who had begun to fret, a lump of hard  sugar to keep him quiet on her arm, she hurried off to tend the  farthest trees before the darkness should close down upon the  silences.                      *       *       *       *       *    When the last birch cup had been emptied into the bucket, the candle  flickered out; and for a moment or two the sudden blackness seemed to  flap in her face, daunting her. She stood perfectly still till her  eyes readjusted themselves. She was dead tired, the baby and the  brimming bucket were heavy, and the adventurous flavour had quite gone  out of her task.    In part because of her fatigue, she grew suddenly timorous. Her ears  began to listen with terrible intentness till they imagined stealthy  footsteps in the silken shrinkings of the damp snow. At last her eyes  mastered the gloom till she could make out the glimmering pathway, the  dim, black trunks shouldering up on either side of it, the clumps of  bushes obstructing it here and there. Trembling--clutching tightly at  the baby, the lantern, and the sap-bucket--she started back with  furtive but hurried footsteps, afraid to make any noise lest she  attract the notice of some mysterious powers of the wilderness.    As the woman went, her fears grew with her haste till only the  difficulties of the path, with the weight of her burdens, prevented  her from breaking into a run of panic. The baby, meanwhile, kept on  sucking his maple-sugar and staring into the novel darkness. The  woman's breath began to come too fast, her knees began to feel as if  they might turn to water at any moment. At last, when within perhaps  fifty paces of the shack, to her infinite relief she saw a dark, tall  figure take shape just over the top of a bush, at the turn of the  trail. She had room for but one thought. It was Dave, back earlier  than he had expected. She did not stop to wonder how or why. With a  little, breathless cry, she exclaimed: \"Oh, Dave, I'm so glad! Take  the baby!\" and reached forward to place the little one in his arms.    Even as she did so, however, something in the tall, dim shape rising  over the bush struck her as unfamiliar. And why didn't Dave speak? She  paused, she half drew back, while a chill fear made her cheeks  prickle; and as she slightly changed her position, the dark form grew  more definite. She saw the massive bulk of the shoulders. She caught a  glint of white teeth, of fierce, wild eyes.    With a screech of intolerable horror, she shrank back, clutching the  baby to her bosom, swung the brimming bucket of sap full into the  monster's face, and fled with the speed of a deer down another trail  toward the shack. She was at the door before her appalled brain  realized that the being to which she had tried to hand over the child  was a huge bear.    Bewildered and abashed for a few seconds by the deluge of liquid and  the clatter of the tin vessel in his face, the animal had not  instantly pursued. But he was just out of the den after his long  winter sleep and savage with hunger. Moreover, he had been allowed to  realize that the dreaded man-creature which he had met so unexpectedly  was afraid of him! He came crashing over the bushes, and was so close  at the woman's heels that she had barely time to slam the shack door  in his face.    As she dropped the rude wooden latch into place, the woman realized  with horror how frail the door was. Momentarily she expected to see it  smashed in by a stroke of the monster's paw. She did not know a bear's  caution, his cunning suspicion of traps, his dread of the scent of  man.    There was no light in the shack, except a faint red gleam from the  open draft of the stove, and the gray pallor of the night sky  glimmering in through the little window. The woman was so faint with  fear that she dared not search for the candles, but leaned panting  against the wall and staring at the window as if she expected the bear  to look in at her. She was brought to her senses in a moment, however,  by the baby beginning to cry. In the race for the shack, he had lost  his lump of sugar, and now he realized how uncomfortable he was. The  woman seated herself on the bench by the stove and began to nurse him,  all the time keeping her eyes on the pale square of the window.    [Illustration: \"SNIFFED LOUDLY ALONG THE CRACK OF THE DOOR.\"]    When the door was slammed in his face, the bear had backed away in  apprehension and paused to study the shack. But at the sound of the  baby's voice he seemed to realize that here, at least, were some  individuals of the dreaded man tribe who were not dangerous. He came  forward and sniffed loudly along the crack of the door till the  woman's heart stood still. He leaned against it, tentatively, till it  creaked, but the latch and hinges held. Then he prowled around the  shack, examining it carefully, and doubtless expecting to find an open  entrance somewhere. In his experience, all caves and dens had  entrances. At last the window caught his attention. The woman heard  the scratching of his claws on the rough outer boarding as he raised  himself. Then the window was darkened by a great black head looking  in.    Throwing the baby into the bunk, the woman snatched from the stove a  blazing stick, rushed to the window with it, and made a wild thrust at  the dreadful face. With a crash the glass flew to splinters, and the  black face disappeared. The bear was untouched, but the fiery weapon  had taught him discretion. He drew back with an angry growl, and sat  down on his haunches as if to see what the woman would do next. She,  for her part, after this victory, grew terribly afraid of setting the  dry shack on fire; so she hurriedly returned the snapping, sparkling  brand to the stove. Thereupon the bear resumed his ominous prowling,  round and round the shack, sometimes testing the foundations and the  door with massive but stealthy paw, sometimes sniffing loudly at the  cracks; and the woman returned to the comforting of the baby.    In time the little one, fed full and cherished, went to sleep. Then,  with nothing left to occupy her mind but the terrors of her situation,  the woman found those stealthy scratchings and sniffings, and the  strain of the silences that fell between, were more than she could  endure. At first, she thought of getting a couple of blazing sticks,  throwing open the shack door, and deliberately attacking her besieger.  But this idea she dismissed as quite too desperate and futile. Then  she remembered that bears were fond of sweets. A table in the corner  was heaped with great, round cakes of fragrant sugar, the shape of the"]]]
