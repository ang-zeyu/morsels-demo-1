[Illustration: _William Hazlitt._]    The difference between a bibliophile and a bibliomaniac has been  described as between one who adorns his mind, and the other his  book-cases. Of the bibliomaniac as here characterized, we can suggest no  better type than Thomas Hill, the original of Poole's 'Paul Pry,' and of  Hull in Hook's novel, 'Gilbert Gurney.' Devoid as Hill was of  intellectual endowments, he managed to obtain and secure the friendship  of many eminent men--of Thomas Campbell, the poet, Matthews and Liston,  the comedians, Hook, Dubois, John and Leigh Hunt, James and Horace  Smith, John Taylor, editor of the _Sun_, Horace Twiss, Baron Field, Sir  George Rose, Barnes, subsequently editor of the _Times_, Cyrus Redding,  and many others. That he was kind-hearted and hospitable nearly everyone  has testified, and his literary parties at his Sydenham Tusculum were  quite important events, in spite of the ponderosity of his well-worn  stories. During the more acute stages of bibliomania in this country at  the latter part of the last century and the beginning of this, 'when the  Archaica, Heliconia, and Roxburghe Clubs were outbidding each other for  old black-letter works . . . when books, in short, which had only become  scarce because they were always worthless, were purchased upon the same  principle as that costly and valueless coin, a Queen Anne's farthing,'  Hill had been a constant collector of rare and other books which were in  demand. That he knew nothing of the insides of his books is very  certain; but he knew how much each copy would bring at an auction, and  how much it had brought at all previous sales. When the bibliomania had  reached its height, Messrs. Longman and Co. determined upon embarking in  such a lucrative branch of the trade; they applied to Hill for advice  and assistance, offering to begin by the purchase of his entire  collection, a proposition which he embraced with alacrity. He drew up a  _catalogue raisonne_ of his books, affixing his price for each volume.  The collection was despatched in three or four trunks to Paternoster  Row, and he received in payment the acceptances of the firm for as many  thousand pounds. From some cause or other, the purchasers soon repented  of their bargain, but the only terms which Horace Smith could obtain for  the Longmans was an extension in the term of payment. Hill declared that  the collection was worth double the price he had been paid for it. For  many years Hill assisted Perry, of the _Morning Chronicle_, in making  selections of rare books for his fine library at Tavistock House,  particularly in the department of facetiae. After leaving Sydenham, Hill  took chambers in James Street, Adelphi, where he resided until his  death. The walls of his rooms were completely hidden by books, and his  couch was 'enclosed in a lofty circumvallation of volumes piled up from  the carpet.' He was never married, had no relations, and even his age  was a source of mystery to his friends. James Smith once said to him:  'The fact is, Hill, the register of your birth was destroyed in the  Great Fire of London, and you take advantage of the accident to conceal  your real age.' Hook went further by suggesting that he might originally  have been one of the little hills recorded as skipping in the Psalms.  Hill died in 1840, his age being placed at eighty-three years. Horace  Smith said 'he could not believe that Hill was dead, and he could not  insult a man he had known so long; Hill would reappear.'    [Illustration: _Thomas Hill, after Maclise._]    Samuel Rogers, the banker poet, was also a book-collector, but not in  the sense of one who aims at number. His house at 22, St. James's Place,  overlooking Green Park, was for over half a century--he had removed  here from the Temple about 1803--one of the most celebrated  meeting-places of literature and art in London. Byron, in his 'Diary,'  says, 'If you enter his house--his drawing-room, his library--you of  yourself say, This is not the dwelling of a common mind. There is not a  gem, a coin, a book, thrown aside on his chimney-piece, his sofa, his  table, that does not bespeak an almost fastidious elegance in the  possessor.' A writer in the _Athenaeum_ of December 29, 1855, a few days  after the poet's death, describes the library as 'lined with bookcases  surmounted by Greek vases, each one remarkable for its exquisite beauty  of form. Upon the gilt lattice-work of the bookcases are lightly hung in  frames some of the finest original sketches by Raphael, Michelangelo,  and Andrea del Sarto; and finished paintings by Angelico da Fiesole, and  Fouquet of Tours.' Among the treasures of the library were the MSS. of  Gray, in their perfect calligraphy, and the famous agreement between  Milton and the publisher Simmonds, for the copyright of 'Paradise Lost.'    [Illustration: _Samuel Rogers's House in St. James's Place._]    [Illustration: Sam{l} Rogers]    Tom Moore the poet, and his friend and fellow-countryman, Thomas  Crofton Croker, were both book-collectors. The library of the former  was, in 1855, presented by his widow to the Royal Irish Academy, 'as a  memorial of her husband's taste and erudition.' Croker's books, which  were dispersed after his death, contain an exceedingly curious  book-plate, either indicating the possessor's residence, 'Rosamond's  Bower, Fulham,' or '3, Gloucester Road, Old Brompton,' the various  learned societies to which he belonged, with the additional information  that he was founder and president (1828-1848) of the Society of  Novimagus. Charles Dickens, Thackeray, W. Harrison Ainsworth (the  collection of the last was sold at Sotheby's in 1882, and realized L469  19s. 6d.), and Charles Lever were not book-collectors in the usual sense  of the word.    [Illustration: _Alexander Dyce, Book-collector._]    Among the more notable literary men who were also book-collectors of  this period, whose libraries are still preserved intact, are Alexander  Dyce and John Forster. Their collections, now at South Kensington, are  perhaps more particularly notable for the extraordinary number of books  which were once the property of famous men. Mr. Dyce, who was born in  Edinburgh, June, 1798, and died in 1869, bequeathed to the Museum 14,000  books, whilst the library of his friend and executor, John Forster  (1812-1876), contained upwards of 18,000 books, in addition to a number  of autographs, pictures, etc. The more interesting books of a 'personal'  nature in these two libraries are the following: Drayton's 'Battaile of  Agincourt,' 1627, a presentation copy to Sir Henry Willoughby, with  inscription in Drayton's autograph; a French cookery-book, with Gray's  autograph on the title; Ben Jonson's copy (with his autograph) of the  first collected edition of Marston's plays, 1633; a copy of Steele's  'Christian Hero,' with some verses in his autograph addressed to Dr.  Ellis, Head-master of the Charterhouse when Steele was at school.  Sheridan's plays include a presentation copy of 'The Rivals,' with an  inscription to David Garrick. The foregoing are all in the Dyce  Collection.

Ellis         With Secret impulse thus do Streams return       To that Capacious Ocean whence they're born:       Oh Would but Fortune come w{th}. bounty fraught       Proportion'd to y{e} mind w{ch}. thou hast taught!         Till then let these unpolish'd leaves impart       The Humble Offering of a Gratefull Heart                                            Rich{d}. Steele]    [Illustration: David Garrick Esq{r}.    From The Author.]    That of John Forster includes a copy of Addison's 'Travels in Italy,'  with an autograph inscription by the author: 'To Dr. Jonathan Swift, the  most Agreeable Companion, the Truest Friend, and the Greatest Genius of  his age, this Book is presented by his most Humble Servant the Author.'  Among the many books on America, there is one with John Locke's  autograph. The copy of the fourth edition of Byron's 'English Bards and  Scotch Reviewers,' 1811, is that which was given by the author to Leigh  Hunt, and contains the poet's autograph and many corrections; a  presentation copy of Flatman's 'Poems and Songs,' 1682, to Izaak Walton,  who has inscribed his autograph in it; Gay's copy of Horace; some  proof-sheets of Johnson's 'Lives of the Poets;' a copy of Keats's  'Lamia,' 1820, with an autograph inscription and a sonnet 'On the  Grasshopper and the Cricket,' also in the poet's handwriting; Gray's  copy of Locke's 'Essay concerning Human Understanding,' a copy of the  'Dunciad,' 1729, with the inscription 'Jonath: Swift, 1729, amicissimi  autoris donum'; and Isaac Newton's copy of Wheare's 'Method and Order of  Reading Histories,' 1685.    [Illustration: John Locke]    [Illustration:         Izaak Walton July 3{o}       1682 given me, by       the author.]    [Illustration: E Libris I. Newton.]    Apropos of books of distinguished ownership, the collecting of them  sometimes takes an eccentric turn; for example, the third Lord Holland  brought together all the various copies (now at Holland House) upon  which he could lay hands of Fox's 'History of the Reign of James II.,'  which belonged to distinguished people, and amongst these former owners  were Sir James Mackintosh, Sir Philip Francis, C. E. Jerningham, Rogers,  and General Fitzpatrick; and as many of the copies contained MS. notes,  the interest of the collection will be readily understood.    A brief review of the principal book-collectors whose libraries--formed  for the most part by men who lived in London--have been dispersed during  the past dozen years will not be without interest; those which have been  already referred to are, of course, omitted here. James Comerford,  F.S.A., by profession a notary public, who"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22608"],[0,"A Book for All Readers (#20)"],[1,"referred to. Books kept in any basement room, or near any wall, absorb  moisture with avidity; both paper and bindings becoming mildewed, and  often covered with blue mould. If long left in this perilous condition,  sure destruction follows; the glue or paste which fastens the cover  softens, the leather loses its tenacity, and the leaves slowly rot, until  the worthless volumes smell to heaven. Books thus injured may be  partially recovered, before the advanced stage of decomposition, by  removal to a dry atmosphere, and by taking the volumes apart, drying the  sheets, and rebinding--a very expensive, but necessary remedy, provided  the books are deemed worth preserving.    But a true remedy is the preventive one. No library should ever be kept,  even in part, in a basement story, nor should any books ever be located  near the wall of a building. All walls absorb, retain, and give out  moisture, and are dangerous and oft-times fatal neighbors to books. Let  the shelves be located at right angles to every wall--with the end  nearest to it at least twelve to eighteen inches removed, and the danger  will be obviated.    A third enemy of the book is heat. Most libraries are unfortunately  over-heated,--sometimes from defective means of controlling the  temperature, and sometimes from carelessness or want of thought in the  attendant. A high temperature is very destructive to books. It warps  their covers, so that volumes unprotected by their fellows, or by a book  support, tend to curl up, and stay warped until they become a nuisance.  It also injures the paper of the volumes by over-heating, and weakening  the tenacity of the leaves held together by the glue on the back, besides  drying to an extreme the leather, till it cracks or crumbles under the  heat. The upper shelves or galleries of any library are most seriously  affected by over-heating, because the natural law causes the heat to rise  toward the ceiling. If you put your hand on some books occupying the  highest places in some library rooms, in mid-winter, when the fires are  kept at their maximum, the heat of the volume will almost burn your  fingers. If these books were sentient beings, and could speak, would they  not say--\"our sufferings are intolerable?\"    The remedy is of course a preventive one; never to suffer the library to  become over-heated, and to have proper ventilation on every floor,  communicating with the air outside. Seventy degrees Fahrenheit is a safe  and proper maximum temperature for books and librarian.    The mischief arising from gas exhalations is another serious source of  danger to books. In many well-lighted libraries, the heat itself from the  numerous gas-burners is sufficient to injure them, and there is besides a  sulphuric acid escaping from the coal-gas fluid, in combustion, which is  most deleterious to bindings. The only remedy appears to be, where  libraries are open evenings, to furnish them with electric lights. This  improved mode of illumination is now so perfected, and so widely  diffused, that it may be reckoned a positive boon to public libraries, in  saving their books from one of their worst and most destructive enemies.    Another of the potent enemies of books is fire. I refer, not to  over-heating the rooms they occupy, but to the risk they continually run,  in most libraries, of total destruction. The chronicle of burned  libraries would make a long and melancholy record, on which there is no  space here to enter. Irreparable losses of manuscripts and early printed  books, and precious volumes printed in small editions, have arisen from  men's neglect of building our book-repositories fire-proof. In all  libraries not provided with iron or steel shelves, there is perpetual  danger. Books do not burn easily, unless surrounded with combustibles,  but these are furnished in nearly all libraries, by surrounding the books  on three sides with wooden shelves, which need only to be ignited at any  point to put the whole collection in a blaze. Then follows the usual  abortive endeavor to save the library by the aid of fire engines, which  flood the building, until the water spoils nearly all which the fire does  not consume. The incalculable losses which the cause of learning has  sustained from the burning of public, university and ecclesiastical  libraries are far greater than the cost which the provision of fire-proof  repositories would have entailed.    Of late years, there has been a partial reform in library construction.  Some have been built fire-proof throughout, with only stone, brick,  concrete and iron material, even to the floors and window casings. Many  more have had iron shelves and iron stacks to hold the shelves  constructed, and there are now several competing manufacturers of these  invaluable safeguards to books. The first library interior constructed  wholly of iron was that of the Library of Congress at Washington, which  had been twice consumed, first when the Capitol was burned by the British  army in 1814, and again in 1851, through a defective flue, when only  20,000 volumes were saved from the flames, out of a total of 55,000. The  example of iron construction has been slowly followed, until now the  large cities have most of their newly-constructed libraries approximately  fire-proof, although many are exposed to fire in parts, owing to a  niggardly and false economy. The lesson that what is worth doing at all  is worth doing well, and that every neglect of security brings sooner or  later irreparable loss, is very slowly learned. Whole hecatombs of books  have been sacrificed to the spirit of commercial greed, blind or  short-sighted enough not to see that secure protection to public  property, though costlier at first, is far cheaper in the end. You may  speak of insurance against library losses by fire, but what insurance  could restore the rare and costly Shakespearean treasures of the  Birmingham Free Library, or the unique and priceless manuscripts that  went up in flames in the city library of Strasburg, in 1870, or the many  precious and irreplaceable manuscript archives of so many of our States,  burned in the conflagration of their capitols?    One would think that the civilized world had had lessons enough, ever  since that seventh century burning of the Alexandrian library by the  Caliph Omar, with that famous but apocryphal rhetorical dilemma, put in  his mouth perhaps by some nimble-witted reporter:--\"If these books agree  with the Koran, they are useless, and should be burned: if not, they are  pernicious, and must not be spared.\" But the heedless world goes  carelessly on, deaf to the voice of reason, and the lessons of history,  amid the holocausts of literature and the wreck of blazing libraries,  uttering loud newspaper wails at each new instance of destruction,  forgotten in a week, then cheerfully renewing the business of building  libraries that invite the flames.    Nothing here said should be interpreted as advice not to insure any  library, in all cases where it is not provided with iron cases for the  books, or a fire-proof building. On the contrary, the menaced destruction  of books or manuscripts that cannot be replaced should lead to securing  means in advance for replacing all the rest in case of loss by fire. And  the experience of the past points the wisdom of locating every library in  an isolated building, where risks of fire from other buildings are  reduced to a minimum, instead of in a block whose buildings (as in most  commercial structures) are lined with wood.    You will perhaps attach but small importance at first thought, to the  next insidious foe to library books that I shall name--that is, wetting  by rain. Yet most buildings leak at the roof, sometime, and some old  buildings are subject to leaks all the time. Even under the roof of the  Capitol at Washington, at every melting of a heavy snow-fall, and on  occasion of violent and protracted rains, there have been leaks pouring  down water into the libraries located in the old part of the building.  Each of these saturated and injured its quota of books, some of which  could only be restored to available use by re-binding, and even then the  leaves were left water-stained in part. See to it that your library roof  is water-tight, or the contents of your library will be constantly  exposed to damage against which there is no insurance.    Another besetting danger to the books of our libraries arises from  insects and vermin. These animated foes appear chiefly in the form of  book-worms, cockroaches, and mice. The first-named is rare in American  libraries, though its ravages have extended far and wide among the old  European ones. This minute little insect, whose scientific name is the  _anobium paniceum_, bores through the leaves of old volumes, making  sometimes holes which deface and mutilate the text. All our public  libraries, doubtless, have on their shelves old folios in vellum or  leather bindings, which present upon opening the disagreeable vision of  leaves eaten through (usually before they crossed the sea) by these  pernicious little borers. It is comforting to add, that I have never  known of any book-worm in the Congressional Library--except the human  variety, which is frequently in evidence. Georgetown College library once  sent me a specimen of the insect, which was found alive in one of its  volumes, but the united testimony of librarians is that this pest is rare  in the United States. As to remedies, the preventive one of sprinkling  the shelves twice a year with a mixture of powdered camphor and snuff, or  the vapor of benzine or carbolic acid, or other repellant chemicals, is  resorted to abroad, but I have not heard of any similar practice in this  country. I may remark in passing, that the term \"book-worm\" is a  misnomer, since it is not a worm at all, but an insect. A more serious  insect menace is the cockroach, a hungry, unclean little beast,"]]]
