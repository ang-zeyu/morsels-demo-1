With a \"Hurrah!\" he jumped up and  turned a somersault right at Santa Claus's feet.    \"Stars and stripes!\" cried Santa. \"What's this?\"    \"Come along, I'll show you the one!\" cried Rob.    Santa Claus allowed himself to be led off to the pile of horses. You  may believe that Rob's sharp eyes soon picked out the one with the  longest tail and the thickest mane.    \"Well, he beats all the boys that ever I saw! What shall I do with the  little spy?\"    \"Oh, dear Santa Claus,\" cried Robby, hugging the red boots, \"do just  take me along with you. I'll stick tight when you slide down the  chimney.\"    \"Yes, I guess you will stick tight--in the chimney, my little man.\"    \"I mean to your back,\" half sobbed Rob.    Santa Claus can't bear to see little folks in trouble, so he took the  boy into his arms, and asked where he wanted to go.    \"To Tommy Turner's, and, oh, you know, that boy in the awful old  jacket that likes popguns,\" was the breathless reply.    Of course he knew him, for he knows every boy and girl in Christendom;  so a popgun was added to the medley of toys. Santa Claus then strapped  Rob and the basket on his back. He next crept through an open window  to a ladder he had placed there, down which he ran as nimbly as a  squirrel. The reindeer before the sledge were in a hurry to be off,  and tinkled their silver bells right merrily. An instant more and they  were snugly tucked up in the white robes; an instant more and they  were flying like the wind over the snow.    Ah! Tommy's home. Santa Claus sprang out, placed the light ladder  against the house, and before Rob could wink a good fair wink they  were on the roof, making for the chimney. Whether it swallowed him, or  he swallowed it, is still a puzzle to Robby.    Tommy lay sleeping in his little bed and dreaming of a merry  Christmas. His rosy mouth was puckered into something between a  whistle and a smile. Rob longed to give him a friendly punch, but  Santa Claus shook his head. They filled his stocking and hurried away,  for empty little stockings the world over were waiting for that  generous hand.    On they sped again, never stopping until they came to a wretched  little hovel. A black pipe instead of a chimney was sticking through  the roof.    Rob thought, \"Now I guess he'll have to give it up.\" But no, he softly  pushed the door open and stepped in.    On a ragged cot lay the urchin to whom Robby had given the cookies.  One of them, half eaten, was still clutched in his hand. Santa Claus  gently opened the other little fist and put the popgun into it.    \"Give him my drum,\" whispered Rob, and Santa Claus, without a word,  placed it near the rumpled head.    How swiftly they flew under the bright stars! How sweetly rang the  bells!    When Santa Claus reined up at Robby's door he found his little comrade  fast asleep. He laid him tenderly in his crib, and drew off a  stocking, which he filled with the smaller toys. The rocking-horse he  placed close to the crib, that Rob might mount him on Christmas  morning.    A kiss, and he was gone.    P.S.--Rob's mother says it was all a dream, but he declares that \"It's  true as Fourth of July!\" I prefer to take his word for it.          A CHILD'S THOUGHTS ABOUT SANTA CLAUS          What do you think my grandmother said,        Telling Christmas stories to me      To-night, when I went and coaxed and coaxed        With my head and arms upon her knee?        She thinks--she really told me so--        That good Mr. Santa Claus, long ago,      Was as old and grey as he is to-day,        Going around with his loaded sleigh.        She thinks he's driven through frost and snow        For a hundred, yes, a thousand times or so,      With jingling bells and a bag of toys--        Ho, ho! for good girls and boys,          With a carol gay,          Crying, \"Clear the way,      For a rollicking, merry Christmas day!\"      Grandmother knows almost everything--        All that I ask her she can tell;      Rivers and towns in geography,        And the hardest words she can always spell.          But the wisest ones, sometimes, they say,          Mistake--and even grandmother may.        If Santa Claus never had been a boy        How would he always know so well      What all the boys are longing for        On Christmas day? Can grandmother tell?        Why does he take the shiny rings,        The baby houses, the dolls with curls,      The little lockets and other such things        Never to boys, but always to girls?        Why does he take the skates and all        The bats and balls, and arrows and bows,      And trumpets and drums, and guns--hurrah!        To the boys? I wonder if grandmother knows?        But there's one thing that doesn't seem right--        If Santa Claus was a boy at play      And hung up his stocking on Christmas night,        Who filled it for him on Christmas day?                            Sydney Dayre.          CHARITY IN A COTTAGE    Jean Ingelow      The charity of the rich is much to be commended; but how beautiful is  the charity of the poor!    Call to mind the coldest day you ever experienced. Think of the bitter  wind and driving snow; think how you shook and shivered--how the sharp  white particles were driven up against your face--how, within doors,  the carpets were lifted like billows along the floors, the wind howled  and moaned in the chimneys, windows cracked, doors rattled, and every  now and then heavy lumps of snow came thundering down with a dull  weight from the roof.    Now hear my story.    In one of the broad, open plains of Lincolnshire, there is a long  reedy sheet of water, a favourite resort of wild ducks. At its  northern extremity stand two mud cottages, old, and out of repair.    One bitter, bitter night, when the snow lay three feet deep on the  ground, and a cutting east wind was driving it about, and whistling in  the dry frozen reeds by the water's edge, and swinging the bare willow  trees till their branches swept the ice, an old woman sat spinning in  one of these cottages before a moderately cheerful fire. Her kettle  was singing on the coals, she had a reed candle, or home-made  rushlight, on her table, but the full moon shone in, and was the  brighter light of the two. These two cottages were far from any road,  or any other habitation; the old woman was, therefore, surprised, in  an old northern song, by a sudden knock at the door.    It was loud and impatient, not like the knock of her neighbours in the  other cottage; but the door was bolted, and the old woman rose, and  shuffling to the window, looked out and saw a shivering figure,  apparently that of a youth.    \"Trampers!\" said the old woman, sententiously, \"tramping folks be not  wanted here.\" So saying she went back to the fire without deigning to  answer the door.    The youth upon this tried the door, and called to her to beg  admittance. She heard him rap the snow from his shoes against her  lintel, and again knock as if he thought she was deaf, and he should  surely gain admittance if he could make her hear.    The old woman, surprised at his audacity, went to the casement and  with all the pride of possession, opened it and inquired his business.    \"Good woman,\" the stranger began, \"I only want a seat at your fire.\"    \"Nay,\" said the old woman, giving effect to her words by her uncouth  dialect, \"thou'll get no shelter here; I've nought to give to  beggars--a dirty, wet critter,\" she continued wrathfully, slamming to  the window. \"It's a wonder where he found any water, too, seeing it  freeze so hard a body can get none for the kettle, saving what's  broken up with a hatchet.\"    The stranger turned very hastily from her door and waded through the  deep snow towards the other cottage. The bitter wind helped to drive  him towards it. It looked no less poor than the first; and when he had  tried the door and found it bolted and fast, his heart sank within  him. His hand was so numbed with cold that he had made scarcely any  noise; he tried again.    A rush candle was burning within and a matronly looking woman sat  before the fire. She held an infant in her arms and had dropped  asleep; but his third knock aroused her, and wrapping her apron round  the child, she opened the door a very little way, and demanded what he  wanted.    \"Good woman,\" the youth began, \"I have had the misfortune to fall in  the water this bitter night, and I am so numbed I can scarcely walk.\"    The woman gave him a sudden earnest look and then sighed.    \"Come in,\" she said; \"thou art so nigh the size of my Jem, I thought  at first it was him come home from sea.\"    The youth stepped across the threshold, trembling with cold and wet;  and no wonder, for his clothes were completely encased in wet mud,  and the water dripped from them with every step he took on the sanded  floor.    \"Thou art in a sorry plight,\" said the woman, \"and it be two miles to  the nighest house; come and kneel down afore the fire; thy teeth  chatter so pitifully I can scarce bear to hear them.\"    She looked at him more attentively and saw that he was a mere boy, not  more than sixteen years of age. Her motherly heart was touched for  him. \"Art hungry?\" she asked, turning to the table. \"Thou art wet to  the skin. What hast been doing?\"    \"Shooting wild ducks,\" said the boy.    \"Oh,\" said the hostess, \"thou art one of the keeper's boys, then, I  reckon?\"    He followed the direction of her eyes, and saw two portions of bread  set upon the table, with a small piece of bacon on each.    \"My master be very late,\" she observed, for charity did not make her  use elegant language, and by her master she meant her husband; \"but  thou art welcome to my bit and sup, for I was waiting for him. Maybe  it will put a little warmth in thee to eat and drink.\" So saying, she  placed before him her own share of the supper.    \"Thank you,\" said the boy; \"but I am so wet I am making quite a pool  before your"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3458"],[0,"Science and Health, with Key to the Scriptures (#20)"],[1,"      ness sets man free to master the infinite idea. This con-          viction shuts the door on death, and opens it  90:27   wide towards immortality. The understanding          and recognition of Spirit must finally come, and we may          as well improve our time in solving the mysteries of being  90:30   through an apprehension of divine Principle. At present          we know not what man is, but we certainly shall know          this when man reflects God.    91:1    The Revelator tells us of \"a new heaven and a          new earth.\" Have you ever pictured this heaven and  91:3    earth, inhabited by beings under the control of supreme          wisdom?            Let us rid ourselves of the belief that man is separated  91:6    from God, and obey only the divine principle, Life and          Love. Here is the great point of departure for all true          spiritual growth.                               Man's genuine being    91:9    It is difficult for the sinner to accept divine Science,          because Science exposes his nothingness; but the sooner          error is reduced to its native nothingness, the  91:12   sooner man's great reality will appear and his          genuine being will be understood. The destruction of          error is by no means the destruction of Truth or Life, but  91:15   is the acknowledgment of them.            Absorbed in material selfhood we discern and reflect          but faintly the substance of Life or Mind. The denial of  91:18   material selfhood aids the discernment of man's spirit-          ual and eternal individuality, and destroys the erroneous          knowledge gained from matter or through what are termed  91:21   the material senses.                              Erroneous postulates            Certain erroneous postulates should be here considered          in order that the spiritual facts may be better  91:24   apprehended.            The first erroneous postulate of belief is, that substance,          life, and intelligence are something apart from God.  91:27   The second erroneous postulate is, that man is both          mental and material.            The third erroneous postulate is, that mind is both evil  91:30   and good; whereas the real Mind cannot be evil nor the          medium of evil, for Mind is God.            The fourth erroneous postulate is, that matter is in-  92:1    telligent, and that man has a material body which is part          of himself.    92:3    The fifth erroneous postulate is, that matter holds in          itself the issues of life and death, - that matter is not          only capable of experiencing pleasure and pain, but also  92:6    capable of imparting these sensations. From the illusion          implied in this last postulate arises the decomposition of          mortal bodies in what is termed death.  92:9    Mind is not an entity within the cranium with the power          of sinning now and forever.                           Knowledge of good and evil            In old Scriptural pictures we see a serpent coiled around  92:12   the tree of knowledge and speaking to Adam and Eve.          This represents the serpent in the act of          commending to our first parents the knowl-  92:15   edge of good and evil, a knowledge gained from matter,          or evil, instead of from Spirit. The portrayal is still          graphically accurate, for the common conception of mor-  92:18   tal man - a burlesque of God's man - is an outgrowth          of human knowledge or sensuality, a mere offshoot of          material sense.                                 Opposing power    92:21   Uncover error, and it turns the lie upon you. Until          the fact concerning error - namely, its nothingness -          appears, the moral demand will not be met,  92:24   and the ability to make nothing of error will          be wanting. We should blush to call that real which is          only a mistake. The foundation of evil is laid on a belief  92:27   in something besides God. This belief tends to support          two opposite powers, instead of urging the claims of Truth          alone. The mistake of thinking that error can be real,  92:30   when it is merely the absence of truth, leads to belief in          the superiority of error.                               The age's privilege            Do you say the time has not yet come in which to  93:1    recognize Soul as substantial and able to control the          body? Remember Jesus, who nearly nineteen centuries  93:3    ago demonstrated the power of Spirit and said,          \"He that believeth on me, the works that I          do shall he do also,\" and who also said, \"But the hour  93:6    cometh, and /now is/, when the true worshippers shall          worship the Father in spirit and in truth.\" \"Behold,          /now/ is the accepted time; behold, /now/ is the day of sal-  93:9    vation,\" said Paul.                              Logic and revelation            Divine logic and revelation coincide. If we believe          otherwise, we may be sure that either our  93:12   logic is at fault or that we have misinterpreted          revelation. Good never causes evil, nor creates aught          that can cause evil.    93:15   Good does not create a mind susceptible of causing          evil, for evil is the opposing error and not the truth of          creation. Destructive electricity is not the offspring of in-  93:18   finite good. Whatever contradicts the real nature of the          divine /Esse/, though human faith may clothe it with angelic          vestments, is without foundation.                              Derivatives of spirit    93:21   The belief that Spirit is finite as well as infinite has          darkened all history. In Christian Science, Spirit, as a          proper noun, is the name of the Supreme Being.  93:24   It means quantity and quality, and applies ex-          clusively to God. The modifying derivatives of the word          /spirit/ refer only to quality, not to God. Man is spiritual.  93:27   He is not God, Spirit. If man were Spirit, then men          would be spirits, gods. Finite spirit would be mortal,          and this is the error embodied in the belief that the infi-  93:30   nite can be contained in the finite. This belief tends to          becloud our apprehension of the kingdom of heaven and          of the reign of harmony in the Science of being.                                 Scientific man    94:1    Jesus taught but one God, one Spirit, who makes man          in the image and likeness of Himself, - of Spirit, not of  94:3    matter. Man reflects infinite Truth, Life, and          Love. The nature of man, thus understood,          includes all that is implied by the terms \"image\" and  94:6    \"likeness\" as used in Scripture. The truly Christian          and scientific statement of personality and of the relation          of man to God, with the demonstration which accompa-  94:9    nied it, incensed the rabbis, and they said: \"Crucify him,          crucify him . . . by our law he ought to die, because he          made himself the Son of God.\"    94:12   The eastern empires and nations owe their false gov-          ernment to the misconceptions of Deity there prevalent.          Tyranny, intolerance, and bloodshed, wherever found,  94:15   arise from the belief that the infinite is formed after the          pattern of mortal personality, passion, and impulse.                             Ingratitude and denial            The progress of truth confirms its claims, and our  94:18   Master confirmed his words by his works. His healing-          power evoked denial, ingratitude, and be-          trayal, arising from sensuality. Of the ten  94:21   lepers whom Jesus healed, but one returned to give God          thanks, - that is, to acknowledge the divine Principle          which had healed him.                                Spiritual insight    94:24   Our Master easily read the thoughts of mankind, and          this insight better enabled him to direct those thoughts          aright; but what would be said at this period of an in-  94:27   fidel blasphemer who should hint that Jesus used his in-          cisive power injuriously? Our Master read mortal mind          on a scientific basis, that of the omnipresence of Mind.  94:30   An approximation of this discernment indicates spiritual          growth and union with the infinite capacities of the one          Mind. Jesus could injure no one by his Mind-reading.  95:1    The effect of his Mind was always to heal and to save,          and this is the only genuine Science of reading mortal  95:3    mind. His holy motives and aims were tra-          duced by the sinners of that period, as they          would be to-day if Jesus were personally present. Paul  95:6    said, \"To be spiritually minded is life.\" We approach          God, or Life, in proportion to our spirituality, our fidel-          ity to Truth and Love; and in that ratio we know all  95:9    human need and are able to discern the thought of the          sick and the sinning for the purpose of healing them.          Error of any kind cannot hide from the law of God.    95:12   Whoever reaches this point of moral culture and good-          ness cannot injure others, and must do them good. The          greater or lesser ability of a Christian Scientist to discern  95:15   thought scientifically, depends upon his genuine spirit-          uality. This kind of mind-reading is not clairvoyance,          but it is important to success in healing, and is one of the  95:18   special characteristics thereof.                              Christ's reappearance            We welcome the increase of knowledge and the end          of error, because even human invention must have its  95:21   day, and we want that day to be succeeded          by Christian Science, by divine reality. Mid-          night foretells the dawn. Led by a solitary star amid  95:24"]]]
