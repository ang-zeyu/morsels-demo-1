Nor have I met with any well-  ascertained cases of transmission of this kind, even when one form is strongly  prepotent over another, when two races are crossed which have been slowly  formed by man's selection, and therefore resemble to a certain extent natural  species. Such cases as puppies in the same litter closely resembling two  distinct breeds, are probably due to superfoetation,--that is, to the  influence of two fathers. All the characters above enumerated, which are  transmitted in a perfect state to some of the offspring and not to others,--  such as distinct colours, nakedness of skin, smoothness of leaves, absence of  horns or tail, additional toes, pelorism, dwarfed structure, etc.,--have all  been known to appear suddenly in individual animals and plants. From this  fact, and from the several slight, aggregated differences which distinguish  domestic races and species from one another, not being liable to this peculiar  form of transmission, we may conclude that it is in some way connected with  the sudden appearance of the characters in question.]    ON THE MODIFICATION OF OLD RACES AND THE FORMATION OF NEW RACES BY CROSSING.    We have hitherto chiefly considered the effects of crossing in giving  uniformity of character; we must now look to an opposite result. There can be  no doubt that crossing, with the aid of rigorous selection during several  generations, has been a potent means in modifying old races, and in forming  new ones. Lord Orford crossed his famous stud of greyhounds once with the  bulldog, in order to give them courage and perseverance. Certain pointers have  been crossed, as I hear from the Rev. W.D. Fox, with the foxhound, to give  them dash and speed. Certain strains of Dorking fowls have had a slight  infusion of Game blood; and I have known a great fancier who on a single  occasion crossed his turbit-pigeons with barbs, for the sake of gaining  greater breadth of beak.    In the foregoing cases breeds have been crossed once, for the sake of  modifying some particular character; but with most of the improved races of  the pig, which now breed true, there have been repeated crosses,--for  instance, the improved Essex owes its excellence to repeated crosses with the  Neapolitan, together probably with some infusion of Chinese blood. (15/22.  Richardson 'Pigs' 1847 pages 37, 42; S. Sidney's edition of 'Youatt on the  Pig' 1860 page 3.) So with our British sheep: almost all the races, except the  Southdown, have been largely crossed; \"this, in fact, has been the history of  our principal breeds.\" (15/23. See Mr. W.C. Spooner's excellent paper on  Cross-Breeding 'Journal Royal Agricult. Soc.' volume 20 part 2: see also an  equally good article by Mr. Ch. Howard in 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1860 page  320.) To give an example, the \"Oxfordshire Downs\" now rank as an established  breed. (15/24. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1857 pages 649, 652.) They were produced  about the year 1830 by crossing \"Hampshire and in some instances Southdown  ewes with Cotswold rams:\" now the Hampshire ram was itself produced by  repeated crosses between the native Hampshire sheep and Southdowns; and the  long-woolled Cotswold were improved by crosses with the Leicester, which  latter again is believed to have been a cross between several long-woolled  sheep. Mr. Spooner, after considering the various cases which have been  carefully recorded, concludes, \"that from a judicious pairing of cross-bred  animals it is practicable to establish a new breed.\" On the continent the  history of several crossed races of cattle and of other animals has been well  ascertained. To give one instance: the King of Wurtemburg, after twenty-five  years' careful breeding, that is, after six or seven generations, made a new  breed of cattle from a cross between a Dutch and a Swiss breed, combined with  other breeds. (15/25. 'Bulletin de La Soc. d'Acclimat.' 1862 tome 9 page 463.  See also for other cases MM. Moll and Gayot 'Du Boeuf' 1860 page 32.) The  Sebright bantam, which breeds as true as any other kind of fowl, was formed  about sixty years ago by a complicated cross. (15/26. 'Poultry Chronicle'  volume 2 1854 page 36.) Dark Brahmas, which are believed by some fanciers to  constitute a distinct species, were undoubtedly formed (15/27. 'The Poultry  Book' by W.B. Tegetmeier 1866 page 58.) in the United States, within a recent  period, by a cross between Chittagongs and Cochins. With plants there is  little doubt that the Swede-turnip originated from a cross; and the history of  a variety of wheat, raised from two very distinct varieties, and which after  six years' culture presented an even sample, has been recorded on good  authority. (15/28. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1852 page 765.)    Until lately, cautious and experienced breeders, though not averse to a single  infusion of foreign blood, were almost universally convinced that the attempt  to establish a new race, intermediate between two widely distinct races, was  hopeless \"they clung with superstitious tenacity to the doctrine of purity of  blood, believing it to be the ark in which alone true safety could be found.\"  (15/29. Spooner in 'Journal Royal Agricult. Soc.' volume 20 part 2) Nor was  this conviction unreasonable: when two distinct races are crossed, the  offspring of the first generation are generally nearly uniform in character;  but even this sometimes fails to be the case, especially with crossed dogs and  fowls, the young of which from the first are sometimes much diversified. As  cross-bred animals are generally of large size and vigorous, they have been  raised in great numbers for immediate consumption. But for breeding they are  found utterly useless; for though they may themselves be uniform in character,  they yield during many generations astonishingly diversified offspring. The  breeder is driven to despair, and concludes that he will never form an  intermediate race. But from the cases already given, and from others which  have been recorded, it appears that patience alone is necessary; as Mr.  Spooner remarks, \"nature opposes no barrier to successful admixture; in the  course of time, by the aid of selection and careful weeding, it is practicable  to establish a new breed.\" After six or seven generations the hoped-for result  will in most cases be obtained; but even then an occasional reversion, or  failure to keep true, may be expected. The attempt, however, will assuredly  fail if the conditions of life be decidedly unfavourable to the characters of  either parent-breed. (15/30. See Colin 'Traite de Phys. Comp. des Animaux  Domestiques' tome 2 page 536, where this subject is well treated.)    Although the grandchildren and succeeding generations of cross-bred animals  are generally variable in an extreme degree, some curious exceptions to the  rule have been observed both with crossed races and species. Thus Boitard and  Corbie (15/31. 'Les Pigeons' page 37.) assert that from a Pouter and a Runt \"a  Cavalier will appear, which we have classed amongst pigeons of pure race,  because it transmits all its qualities to its posterity.\" The editor of the  'Poultry Chronicle' (15/32. Volume 1 1854 page 101.) bred some bluish fowls  from a black Spanish cock and a Malay hen; and these remained true to colour  \"generation after generation.\" The Himalayan breed of rabbits was certainly  formed by crossing two sub-varieties of the silver-grey rabbit; although it  suddenly assumed its present character, which differs much from that of either  parent-breed, yet it has ever since been easily and truly propagated. I  crossed some Labrador and Penguin ducks, and recrossed the mongrels with  Penguins; afterwards most of the ducks reared during three generations were  nearly uniform in character, being brown with a white crescentic mark on the  lower part of the breast, and with some white spots at the base of the beak;  so that by the aid of a little selection a new breed might easily have been  formed. With regard to crossed varieties of plants, Mr. Beaton (15/33.  'Cottage Gardener' 1856 page 110.) remarks that \"Melville's extraordinary  cross between the Scotch kale and an early cabbage is as true and genuine as  any on record;\" but in this case no doubt selection was practised. Gartner  (15/34. 'Bastarderzeugung' s. 553.) has given five cases of hybrids, in which  the progeny kept constant; and hybrids between Dianthus armeria and deltoides  remained true and uniform to the tenth generation. Dr. Herbert likewise showed  me a hybrid from two species of Loasa which from its first production had kept  constant during several generations.    We have seen in the first chapter, that the several kinds of dogs are almost  certainly descended from more than one species, and so it is with cattle, pigs  and some other domesticated animals. Hence the crossing of aboriginally  distinct species probably came into play at an early period in the formation  of our present races. From Rutimeyer's observations there can be little doubt  that this occurred with cattle; but in most cases one form will probably have  absorbed and obliterated the other, for it is not likely that semi-civilised  men would have taken the necessary pains to modify by selection their  commingled, crossed, and fluctuating stock. Nevertheless, those animals which  were best adapted to their conditions of life would have survived through  natural selection; and by this means crossing will often have indirectly aided  in the formation of primeval domesticated breeds. Within recent times, as far  as animals are concerned, the crossing of distinct species has done little or  nothing towards the formation or modification of our races. It is not yet  known whether the several species of silk-moth which have been recently"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28752"],[0,"Pleasures of the telescope (#20)"],[1,"  from all his work, a good blow will have been dealt for the cause of  truth. Systems far vaster than ours are now in the bud, and long before  they have bloomed, ambitious man, who once dreamed that all these things  were created to serve him, will probably have vanished with the  extinguishment of the little star whose radiant energy made his life and  his achievements briefly possible.    [4] For further details on this subject see Astronomy with an  Opera-glass.    In August, 1885, a new star of magnitude six and a half made its  appearance suddenly near the center of the Andromeda nebula. Within one  year it had disappeared, having gradually dwindled until the great  Washington telescope, then the largest in use, no longer showed it. That  this was a phenomenon connected with the nebula is most probable, but  just what occurred to produce it nobody knows. The observed appearances  might have been produced by a collision, and no better hypothesis has  yet been suggested to account for them.    Near the opposite end of the constellation from alpha we find the most  interesting of triple stars in gamma. The two larger components of this  beautiful star are of magnitudes three and six, distance 10\", colors  golden yellow and deep blue. The three-inch shows them finely. The  smaller star is itself double, its companion being of magnitude eight,  distance when discovered in 1842 0.5\", color bluish green. A few years  ago this third star got so close to its primary that it was invisible  even with the highest powers of the great Lick telescope, but at present  it is widening again. In October, 1893, I had the pleasure of looking at  gamma Andromedae with the Lick telescope, and at that time it was  possible just to separate the third star. The angle seemed too small for  certain measurement, but a single setting of the micrometer by Mr.  Barnard, to whose kindness I was indebted for my view of the star, gave  0.17\" as the approximate distance. In 1900 the distance had increased to  0.4\", p. 115 deg.. The brilliance of color contrast between the two larger  stars of gamma Andromedae is hardly inferior to that exhibited in beta  Cygni, so that this star may be regarded as one of the most picturesque  of stellar objects for small telescopes.    Other pleasing objects in this constellation are the binary star 36,  magnitudes six and six and a half, distance 1\", p. 17 deg.--the two stars  are slowly closing and the five-inch glass is required to separate them:  the richly colored variable R, which fades from magnitude five and a  half to invisibility, and then recovers its light in a period of about  four hundred and five days; and the bright star cluster 457, which  covers a space about equal to the area of the full moon.    Just south of the eastern end of Andromeda is the small constellation  Triangulum, or the Triangles, containing two interesting objects. One of  these is the beautiful little double 6, magnitudes five and six,  distance 3.8\", p. 77 deg., colors yellow and blue; and the other, the nebula  352, which equals in extent the star cluster in Andromeda described  above, but nevertheless appears very faint with our largest glass. Its  faintness, however, is not an indication of insignificance, for to very  powerful telescopes it exhibits a wonderful system of nuclei and  spirals--another bit of chaos that is yielding by age-long steps to the  influence of demiurgic forces.    A richer constellation than Andromeda, both for naked-eye and telescopic  observation, is Perseus, which is especially remarkable for its star  clusters. Two of these, 512 and 521, constitute the celebrated double  cluster, sometimes called the Sword-hand of Perseus, and also chi  Persei. To the smallest telescope this aggregation of stars, ranging in  magnitude from six and a half to fourteen, and grouped about two  neighboring centers, presents a marvelous appearance. As an educative  object for those unaccustomed to celestial observations it may be  compared among star clusters to beta Cygni among double stars, for the  most indifferent spectator is struck with wonder in viewing it. All the  other clusters in Perseus represented on the map are worth examining,  although none of them calls for special mention, except perhaps 584,  where we may distinguish at least a hundred separate stars within an  area less than one quarter as expansive as the face of the moon.    Among the double stars of Perseus we note first eta, whose components  are of magnitudes four and eight, distance 28\", colors white and pale  blue. The double epsilon is especially interesting on account of an  alleged change of color from blue to red which the smaller star  undergoes coincidently with a variation of brightness. The magnitudes  are three and eight, distance 9\", p. 9 deg.. An interesting multiple is  zeta, two of whose stars at least we can see. The magnitudes are three,  nine, ten, and ten, distances 13\", p. 207 deg., 90\", and 112\".    The chief attraction in Perseus is the changeful and wonderful beta, or  Algol, the great typical star among the short-period variables. During  the greater part of its period this star is of magnitude two and two  tenths, but for a very short time, following a rapid loss of light, it  remains at magnitude three and seven tenths. The difference, one  magnitude and a half, corresponds to an actual difference in brightness  in the ratio of 3.75 to 1. The entire loss of light during the  declension occupies only four hours and a half. The star remains at its  faintest for a few minutes only before a perceptible gain of light  occurs, and the return to maximum is as rapid as was the preceding  decline. The period from one minimum to the next is two days twenty  hours forty-eight minutes fifty-three seconds, with an irregularity  amounting to a few seconds in a year. The Arabs named the star Algol, or  the Demon, on account of its eccentricity which did not escape their  attention; and when Goodricke, in 1782, applied a scientific method of  observation to it, the real cause of its variations was suggested by  him, but his explanation failed of general acceptance until its truth  was established by Prof. E. C. Pickering in 1880. This explanation gives  us a wonderful insight into stellar constitution. According to it, Algol  possesses a companion as large as the sun, but invisible, both because  of its proximity to that star and because it yields no light, and  revolving in a plane horizontal to our line of sight. The period of  revolution is identical with the period of Algol's cycle of variation,  and the diminution of light is caused by the interposition of the dark  body as it sweeps along that part of its orbit lying between our point  of view and the disk of Algol. In other words, once in every two days  twenty hours and forty-nine minutes Algol, as seen from the earth,  undergoes a partial eclipse.    In consequence of the great comparative mass of its dark companion,  Algol itself moves in an orbit around their common center with a  velocity quite sufficient to be detected by the shifting of the lines in  its spectrum. By means of data thus obtained the mass, size, and  distance apart of Algol and its singular comrade have been inferred. The  diameter of Algol is believed to be about 1,125,000 miles, that of the  dark body about 840,000 miles, and the mean distance from center to  center 3,230,000 miles. The density of both the light and the dark star  is slight compared with that of the sun, so that their combined mass is  only two thirds as great as the sun's.    Mention has been made of a slight irregularity in Algol's period of  variation. Basing his calculations upon this inequality, Dr. Chandler  has put forward the hypothesis that there is another invisible body  connected with Algol, and situated at a distance from it of about  1,800,000,000 miles, and that around this body, which is far more  massive than the others, Algol and its companions revolve in a period of  one hundred and thirty years! Dr. Chandler has earned the right to have  his hypotheses regarded with respect, even when they are as  extraordinary as that which has just been described. It needs no  indulgence of the imagination to lend interest to Algol; the simple  facts are sufficient. How did that bright star fall in with its black  neighbors? Or were they created together?    [Illustration: MAP NO. 25.]    Passing to the region covered by map No. 25, our eyes are caught by the  curious figure, formed by the five brightest stars of the constellation  Cassiopeia, somewhat resembling the letter W. Like Perseus, this is a  rich constellation, both in star clusters and double stars. Among the  latter we select as our first example sigma, in which we find a  combination of color that is at once very unusual and very  striking--green and blue. The magnitudes are five and seven, distance  3\", p. 324 deg.. Another beautiful colored double is eta, whose magnitudes  are four and seven and a half, distance 5\", p. 200 deg., colors white and  purple. This is one of the comparatively small number of stars the  measure of whose distance has been attempted, and a keen sense of the  uncertainty of such measures is conveyed by the fact that authorities of  apparently equal weight place eta Cassiopeiae at such discordant  distances as 124,000,000,000,000 miles, 70,000,000,000,000 miles, and  42,000,000,000,000 miles. It will be observed that the difference  between the greatest and the least of these estimates is about double  the entire distance given by the latter. The same thing is practically  true of the various attempts to ascertain the distance of the other  stars which have a perceptible parallax, even those which are evidently  the nearest. In some cases the later measures increase the distance, in  other cases they diminish it; in no case is there anything like a  complete accord. Yet of course we are not to infer that it is hopeless  to"]]]
