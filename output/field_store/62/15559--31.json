Nor was the fear entirely  an illusion, for the barren valley was thickly strewn with trees and  boulders which had fallen in a similar manner. Even as they passed,  a great rock came thundering down with a hoarse rattle which woke  the echoes in the silent gorges, and startled the weary horses into a  gallop.    As the sun rose slowly above the eastern horizon, the caps of the great  mountains lit up one after the other, like lamps at a festival, until  they were all ruddy and glowing. The magnificent spectacle cheered the  hearts of the three fugitives and gave them fresh energy. At a wild  torrent which swept out of a ravine they called a halt and watered their  horses, while they partook of a hasty breakfast. Lucy and her father  would fain have rested longer, but Jefferson Hope was inexorable. \"They  will be upon our track by this time,\" he said. \"Everything depends upon  our speed. Once safe in Carson we may rest for the remainder of our  lives.\"    During the whole of that day they struggled on through the defiles, and  by evening they calculated that they were more than thirty miles from  their enemies. At night-time they chose the base of a beetling crag,  where the rocks offered some protection from the chill wind, and there  huddled together for warmth, they enjoyed a few hours' sleep. Before  daybreak, however, they were up and on their way once more. They had  seen no signs of any pursuers, and Jefferson Hope began to think that  they were fairly out of the reach of the terrible organization whose  enmity they had incurred. He little knew how far that iron grasp could  reach, or how soon it was to close upon them and crush them.    About the middle of the second day of their flight their scanty store  of provisions began to run out. This gave the hunter little uneasiness,  however, for there was game to be had among the mountains, and he had  frequently before had to depend upon his rifle for the needs of life.  Choosing a sheltered nook, he piled together a few dried branches and  made a blazing fire, at which his companions might warm themselves, for  they were now nearly five thousand feet above the sea level, and the air  was bitter and keen. Having tethered the horses, and bade Lucy adieu,  he threw his gun over his shoulder, and set out in search of whatever  chance might throw in his way. Looking back he saw the old man and the  young girl crouching over the blazing fire, while the three animals  stood motionless in the back-ground. Then the intervening rocks hid them  from his view.    He walked for a couple of miles through one ravine after another without  success, though from the marks upon the bark of the trees, and other  indications, he judged that there were numerous bears in the vicinity.  At last, after two or three hours' fruitless search, he was thinking of  turning back in despair, when casting his eyes upwards he saw a sight  which sent a thrill of pleasure through his heart. On the edge of a  jutting pinnacle, three or four hundred feet above him, there stood a  creature somewhat resembling a sheep in appearance, but armed with a  pair of gigantic horns. The big-horn--for so it is called--was acting,  probably, as a guardian over a flock which were invisible to the hunter;  but fortunately it was heading in the opposite direction, and had not  perceived him. Lying on his face, he rested his rifle upon a rock, and  took a long and steady aim before drawing the trigger. The animal sprang  into the air, tottered for a moment upon the edge of the precipice, and  then came crashing down into the valley beneath.    The creature was too unwieldy to lift, so the hunter contented himself  with cutting away one haunch and part of the flank. With this trophy  over his shoulder, he hastened to retrace his steps, for the evening was  already drawing in. He had hardly started, however, before he realized  the difficulty which faced him. In his eagerness he had wandered far  past the ravines which were known to him, and it was no easy matter  to pick out the path which he had taken. The valley in which he found  himself divided and sub-divided into many gorges, which were so like  each other that it was impossible to distinguish one from the other.  He followed one for a mile or more until he came to a mountain torrent  which he was sure that he had never seen before. Convinced that he had  taken the wrong turn, he tried another, but with the same result. Night  was coming on rapidly, and it was almost dark before he at last found  himself in a defile which was familiar to him. Even then it was no easy  matter to keep to the right track, for the moon had not yet risen, and  the high cliffs on either side made the obscurity more profound. Weighed  down with his burden, and weary from his exertions, he stumbled along,  keeping up his heart by the reflection that every step brought him  nearer to Lucy, and that he carried with him enough to ensure them food  for the remainder of their journey.    He had now come to the mouth of the very defile in which he had left  them. Even in the darkness he could recognize the outline of the cliffs  which bounded it. They must, he reflected, be awaiting him anxiously,  for he had been absent nearly five hours. In the gladness of his heart  he put his hands to his mouth and made the glen re-echo to a loud halloo  as a signal that he was coming. He paused and listened for an answer.  None came save his own cry, which clattered up the dreary silent  ravines, and was borne back to his ears in countless repetitions. Again  he shouted, even louder than before, and again no whisper came back from  the friends whom he had left such a short time ago. A vague, nameless  dread came over him, and he hurried onwards frantically, dropping the  precious food in his agitation.    When he turned the corner, he came full in sight of the spot where the  fire had been lit. There was still a glowing pile of wood ashes there,  but it had evidently not been tended since his departure. The same  dead silence still reigned all round. With his fears all changed to  convictions, he hurried on. There was no living creature near the  remains of the fire: animals, man, maiden, all were gone. It was only  too clear that some sudden and terrible disaster had occurred during  his absence--a disaster which had embraced them all, and yet had left no  traces behind it.    Bewildered and stunned by this blow, Jefferson Hope felt his head spin  round, and had to lean upon his rifle to save himself from falling. He  was essentially a man of action, however, and speedily recovered from  his temporary impotence. Seizing a half-consumed piece of wood from the  smouldering fire, he blew it into a flame, and proceeded with its help  to examine the little camp. The ground was all stamped down by the feet  of horses, showing that a large party of mounted men had overtaken  the fugitives, and the direction of their tracks proved that they had  afterwards turned back to Salt Lake City. Had they carried back both of  his companions with them? Jefferson Hope had almost persuaded himself  that they must have done so, when his eye fell upon an object which made  every nerve of his body tingle within him. A little way on one side of  the camp was a low-lying heap of reddish soil, which had assuredly  not been there before. There was no mistaking it for anything but a  newly-dug grave. As the young hunter approached it, he perceived that a  stick had been planted on it, with a sheet of paper stuck in the cleft  fork of it. The inscription upon the paper was brief, but to the point:                            JOHN FERRIER,                   FORMERLY OF SALT LAKE CITY, [22]                      Died August 4th, 1860.    The sturdy old man, whom he had left so short a time before, was gone,  then, and this was all his epitaph. Jefferson Hope looked wildly round  to see if there was a second grave, but there was no sign of one. Lucy  had been carried back by their terrible pursuers to fulfil her original  destiny, by becoming one of the harem of the Elder's son. As the young  fellow realized the certainty of her fate, and his own powerlessness to  prevent it, he wished that he, too, was lying with the old farmer in his  last silent resting-place.    Again, however, his active spirit shook off the lethargy which springs  from despair. If there was nothing else left to him, he could at least  devote his life to revenge. With indomitable patience and perseverance,  Jefferson Hope possessed also a power of sustained vindictiveness, which  he may have learned from the Indians amongst whom he had lived. As he  stood by the desolate fire, he felt that the only one thing which could  assuage his grief would be thorough and complete retribution, brought  by his own hand upon his enemies. His strong will and untiring energy  should, he determined, be devoted to that one end. With a grim, white  face, he retraced his steps to where he had dropped the food, and having  stirred up the smouldering fire, he cooked enough to last him for a  few days. This he made up into a bundle, and, tired as he was, he  set himself to walk back through the mountains upon the track of the  avenging angels.    For five days he toiled footsore and weary through the defiles which he  had already traversed on horseback. At night he flung himself down among  the rocks, and snatched a few hours of sleep; but before daybreak he was  always well on his way. On the sixth day, he reached the Eagle Canon,  from which they had commenced their ill-fated flight. Thence he could  look down upon the home of the saints. Worn and exhausted, he leaned  upon his rifle and shook his gaunt hand fiercely at the silent  widespread city beneath him. As he looked at it, he observed that  there were flags in some of the principal streets, and other signs of  festivity. He was still speculating as to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24409"],[0,"Our Common Insects (#20)"],[1,"ody.

THE DRAGON FLY.      Were we to select from among the insects a type of all that is savage,  relentless, and bloodthirsty, the Dragon fly would be our choice. From  the moment of its birth until its death, usually a twelve-month, it  riots in bloodshed and carnage. Living beneath the waters perhaps eleven  months of its life, in the larva and pupa states, it is literally a  walking pitfall for luckless aquatic insects; but when transformed into  a fly, ever on the wing in pursuit of its prey, it throws off all  concealment, and reveals the more unblushingly its rapacious character.    Not only do its horrid visage and ferocious bearing frighten children,  who call it the \"Devil's Darning-needle,\" but it even distresses older  persons, so that its name has become a byword. Could we understand the  language of insects, what tales of horror would be revealed! What  traditions, sagas, fables, and myths must adorn the annals of animal  life regarding this Dragon among insects!    To man, however, aside from its bad name and its repulsive aspect, which  its gay trappings do not conceal, its whole life is beneficent. It is a  scavenger, being like that class ugly and repulsive, and holding  literally, among insects, the lowest rank in society. In the water, it  preys upon young mosquitoes and the larvae of other noxious insects. It  thus aids in maintaining the balance of life, and cleanses the swamps of  miasmata, thus purifying the air we breathe. During its existence of  three or four weeks above the waters, its whole life is a continued good  to man. It hawks over pools and fields and through gardens, decimating  swarms of mosquitoes, flies, gnats, and other baneful insects. It is a  true Malthus' delight, and, following that sanguinary philosopher, we  may believe that our Dragon fly is an entomological Tamerlane or  Napoleon sent into the world by a kind Providence to prevent too close a  jostling among the myriads of insect life.    We will, then, conquer our repugnance to its ugly looks and savage mien,  and contemplate the hideous monstrosity,--as it is useless to deny that  it combines the graces of the Hunchback of Notre Dame and Dickens'  Quilp, with certain features of its own,--for the good it does in  Nature.    Even among insects, a class replete with forms the very incarnation of  ugliness and the perfection of all that is hideous in nature, our Dragon  fly is most conspicuous. Look at its enormous head, with its beetling  brows, retreating face, and heavy under jaws,--all eyes and teeth,--and  hung so loosely on its short, weak neck, sunk beneath its enormous  hunchback,--for it is wofully round-shouldered,--while its long, thin  legs, shrunken as if from disease, are drawn up beneath its breast, and  what a hobgoblin it is!    Its gleaming wings are, however, beautiful objects. They form a broad  expanse of delicate parchment-like membrane drawn over an intricate  network of veins. Though the body is bulky, it is yet light, and easily  sustained by the wings. The long tail undoubtedly acts as a rudder to  steady its flight.    These insects are almost universally dressed in the gayest colors. The  body is variously banded with rich shades of blue, green, and yellow,  and the wings give off the most beautiful iridescent and metallic  reflections.    During July and August the various species of Libellula and its allies  most abound. The eggs are attached loosely in bunches to the stems of  rushes and other water-plants. In laying them, the Dragon fly, according  to Mr. P. R. Uhler's observations, \"alights upon water-plants, and,  pushing the end of her body below the surface of the water, glues a  bunch of eggs to the submerged stem or leaf. Libellula auripennis I have  often seen laying eggs, and I think I was not deceived in my observation  that she dropped a bunch of eggs into the open ditch while balancing  herself just a little way above the surface of the water. I have, also,  seen her settled upon the reeds in brackish water with her abdomen  submerged in part, and there attaching a cluster of eggs. I feel pretty  sure that L. auripennis does not always deposit the whole of her eggs at  one time, as I have seen her attach a cluster of not more than a dozen  small yellow eggs. There must be more than one hundred eggs in one of  the large bunches. The eggs of some of the Agrions are bright  apple-green, but I cannot be sure that I have ever seen them in the very  act of oviposition. They have curious habits of settling upon leaves and  grass growing in the water, and often allow their abdomens to fall below  the surface of the water; sometimes they fly against the surface, but I  never saw what I could assert to be the projecting of the eggs from the  body upon plants or into the water. The English entomologists assert  that the female Agrion goes below the surface to a depth of several  inches to deposit eggs upon the submerged stems of plants.\" The Agrions,  however, according to Lucaze Duthiers, a French anatomist, make, with  the ovipositor, a little notch in the plant upon which they lay their  eggs.    [Illustration: 127. Under side of head of Diplax, with the labium or  mask fully extended. _x_, _x_', _x_''the three subdivisions of the  labium. _y_, the maxillae or second pair of jaws.]    These eggs soon hatch, probably during the heat of summer. The larva is  very active in its habits, being provided with six legs, attached to the  thorax, on the back of which are the little wing-pads, or rudimentary  wings. The large head is provided with enormous eyes, while a pair of  simple, minute eyelets (ocelli) are placed near the origin of the small  bristle-like feelers, or antennae. Seen from beneath, instead of the  formidable array of jaws and accessory organs commonly observed in most  carnivorous larvae, we see nothing but a broad, smooth mask covering the  lower part of the face; as if from sheer modesty our young Dragon fly  was endeavoring to conceal a gape. But wait a moment. Some unwary insect  comes within striking distance. The battery of jaws is unmasked, and  opens upon the victim. This mask (Fig. 127) is peculiar to the young,  or larva and pupa of the Dragon fly. It is the labium, or under lip  greatly enlarged, and armed at the broad spoon-shaped extremity (Fig.  127, _x_) with two sharp hooks, adapted for seizing and retaining its  prey. At rest, the terminal half is so bent up as to conceal the face,  and thus the creature crawls about, to all appearance, the most innocent  and lamb-like of insects.    [Illustration: 128. Abdominal valves; _a_, side view.]    Not only does the immature Dragon fly walk over the bottom of the pool  or stream it inhabits, but it can also leap for a considerable distance,  and by a most curious contrivance. By a syringe-like apparatus lodged in  the end of the body, it discharges a stream of water for a distance of  two or three inches behind it, thus propelling the insect forwards. This  apparatus combines the functions of locomotion and respiration. There  are, as usual, two breathing pores (stigmata) on each side of the  thorax. But the process of breathing seems to be mostly carried on in  the tail. The tracheae are here collected in a large mass, sending their  branches into folds of membrane lining the end of the alimentary canal,  and which act like a piston to force out the water. The entrance to the  canal is protected by three to five triangular horny valves (Fig. 128,  9, 10, 128 _a_, side view), which open and shut at will. When open, the  water flows in, bathing the internal gill-like organs, which extract the  air from the water, which is then suddenly expelled by a strong muscular  effort.    [Illustration: 129. Agrion; _b_, False Gill of Larva.]    In the smaller forms, such as Agrion (A. saucium, Fig. 129; Fig. 129  _b_, side view of false gill, showing but one leaf), the respiratory  leaves, called the tracheary, or false-gills, are not enclosed within  the body, but form three broad leaves, permeated by tracheae, or  air-vessels. They are not true gills, however, as the blood is not  aerated in them. They only absorb air to supply the tracheae, which  aerate the blood only within the general cavity of the body. These false  gills also act as a rudder to aid the insect in swimming.    It is interesting to watch the Dragon flies through their  transformations, as they can easily be kept in aquaria. Little, almost  nothing, is known regarding their habits, and any one who can spend the  necessary time and patience in rearing them, so as to trace up the  different stages from the larva to the adult fly, and describe and  figure them accurately, will do good service to science.    [Illustration: 130. Pupa of Cordulia.]    Mr. Uhler states that at present we know but little of the young stages  of our species, but the larva and pupa of the Libellulas may be always  known from the AEschnas by the shorter, deeper and more robust form, and  generally"]]]
