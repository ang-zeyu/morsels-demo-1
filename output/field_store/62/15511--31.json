The tea table is a round stand, about twelve inches       from the ground, at which the tea boy sits down on a leather       cushion, cross legged.         When dinner is served, the food is in a large dish or bowl, on a       round stand, similar to that above described; three, four, or more       sit round it; a servant comes to the company with a ewer and       napkin; each person wash their right hand, and eat with their       fingers; in the higher circles, rose-water is used instead of       plain; if soup is served, they eat it with wooden spoons; in this       respect the emperor himself sets them the example, who reprobates       the use of the precious metals with food.         When the Moors sit down to eat; high and low, rich and poor, (for I       have partaken of food with all ranks, from the prince to the       plebeian,) they invariably invoke God's blessing, previous to the       repast, and offer thanks at the conclusion. Their first grace is,       invariable, short, and comprehensive; _bis'm illah_, \"In the name  97   of God.\" The after grace is, _El Ham'd u littah_, \"Praise be to       God.\"         A very excellent dish is generally eaten in this country, called       _cuscasoe_; it is made with flour, granulated into particles the       size of a partridge shot, which is, put over a steamer, till the       steam has sufficiently passed through it, so as to produce the       effect of boiling; it is then taken off, broken, and returned to       steam a second time; in the meantime, a chicken or some meat is       boiling in the saucepan, under the steamer, with onions, turnips,       and other vegetables; when the _cuscasoe_ has been steamed a second       time, it is taken off, coloured with saffron, and mixed with some       butter, salt, and pepper, and piled up in a large round bowl or       dish, garnished with the chicken or meat and vegetables. This is a       very nutritious, wholesome, and palatable dish, when well cooked.       It is in high estimation with the Arabs, Moors, Brebers, Shelluhs,       and Negroes. When they sit down to eat, each person puts his       fingers into the dish before him; and in respectable society, it is       remarkable how dextrously they jerk the food into their mouths,       which never come into contact with their hands; so that this mode       of eating is scarcely objectionable, certainly not obnoxious, as       some travellers have represented it; but who probably had       associated with the lower ranks of society, who, indeed, are not       particular in these observances.  98       All kind of trades are carried on at Marocco: jewellers,       goldsmiths, blacksmiths, coppersmiths, tanners, &c. &c.; but that       which is the most honourable, is a shoe-maker, because Muhamed       himself was one. At Mequinas they make excellent shoes, of leather       impervious to water, for 1_s._ 8_d._ per pair.         The time now approached for our audience of business, and we had       represented to the _Talb Cadus_, that the export duties on some       articles were too heavy, viz. on wax, almonds, and olive oil; also       on certain imports, viz. iron, steel, and Buenos Ayres hides; but       no diminution was obtained, except in the duty of bees' wax. The       emperor gave hopes of an exportation of grain, and desired us to       write to Europe for ships to come and load wheat, barley, Indian       corn, caravances, beans, lentils, and millet. We were favourably       received; the emperor asked several questions respecting Europe,       and informed us we should return to Mogodor in a few days. Three       days after this audience we were ordered to meet the emperor in the       _Jenan En neel_, where we had our audience of leave, and the       emperor gave each of us a fine horse, chosen by ourselves out of       his own stable; and we took our leave and departed for Mogodor the       following evening. We slept encamped under the magnificent and       lofty date trees, in the neighbourhood of the city, the first       night.  99         LETTER X.         FROM MR. WILLIS TO MR. JACKSON.         Harley-street, London,         My dear Sir,                                 September 10, 1798.         I write to acknowledge the receipt of your favour. I know no man       better qualified than yourself for the station of an African       consul; and really think, that to assist you in obtaining such a       post, is to render service to my country, as well as to yourself.       Your information concerning the interior of Africa, and especially       concerning Timbuctoo, appears to me to be more accurate, authentic,       and extensive than that of any other person I have met with;       considerably more so than that of any of the correspondents of the       African association. Mr. Park, of whose return you are informed,       has brought home no addition to the stock of our knowledge of that       important place; though I think his geographical communications are       highly valuable, particularly as they regard the river and course,       &c. of the Niger. This celebrated river will, I think, in time be       the channel of communication between Europe and the interior of       Africa. It seems to penetrate into that continent, in its widest       and most interesting part; if it should be navigable through its       entire course, we might hereafter make it the instrument of the       most important discoveries, and the channel of the most valuable  100  commerce. I shall be much obliged to you for information concerning       this river, particularly as to its termination. I suspect it       discharges itself into some interior sea or vast lake, like the       Caspian; unless, like the Burrampooter, after various and extensive       windings, it may return towards its source, and fall into the       Atlantic.         You will have heard of the landing of a French army in Egypt, under       Buonaparte; the French are enterprising, and if they should       penetrate from the eastward, while we advance from the west, the       interior of the African continent may at length be laid open.         I remain, my dear Sir,       Your's sincerely,         J. WILLIS.  101         LETTER XI.         FROM THE SAME TO THE SAME.                                                    Harley-street, London,                                                           June 10.1800.       My dear Sir,         I did not receive, till the 22d November, your favour, dated 1st       September last, for which I beg you to receive my best thanks. I       have transmitted an extract of it to Lord Moira, Sir Joseph Banks,       and to a friend of mine, who is a member of parliament, and has       great influence with his majesty's ministers; in order that he may       lay it before the secretary of state, in such a manner as to draw       his attention to it in the most impressive and effectual manner;       but I much fear that the pressure of the war, and its consequent       effects; the arrangements of finance, &c. will preclude their       immediate support to objects which they consider as of very       subordinate importance. The time is certainly highly favourable for       the cultivation of the friendship of the emperor, and of other       Muhamedan sovereigns; now that the British arms have preserved the       principal empire of the Moslems, by the victory at Aboukir, and the       defense of Acre; in consequence of which, Egypt has been recovered,       and one of the sacred gates of the Caaba again opened to the  102  Mussulmen. This appears to be an event of the highest consideration       to the Muhamedans of Africa, since it is by Grand Cairo, that the       western pilgrims communicate with Mecca.         I suppose you have received the narratives, published by Park and       Browne, of their respective journies and discoveries in the       interior of your continent; they have done much, but much more       still remains to be done; and above all, the discovery of Timbuctoo       and its commercial relations.         There is a captain Wild, now either at Tunis or Algiers, preparing       himself for this journey, (as I am informed,) a man of intrepidity,       judgment, and enterprise; whom Sir Joseph Banks writes me, he hopes       to engage in the employment of the African association.         I assure you that I consider you, as the only European that       possesses any substantial and interesting information concerning       that part of interior Africa, which we are most solicitous to       investigate; and, therefore, set a high value upon whatever you are       so good as to communicate. I am also of opinion, that your plans       may very probably be adopted by administration, when the return of       peace shall leave their minds at liberty to attend to it.  103         LETTER XII.         FROM THE SAME TO THE SAME.                                                   Harley-street, London,                                                 5th May, 1801.       My dear Sir,         I wrote you at considerable length on the 1st of June last, and       assure you that none of your letters, received prior to that date,       have remained unanswered. I have now to acknowledge the receipt of       your several favours, and beg you to accept my best thanks, for       your very curious and valuable present of the gold ring from       Wangara, which has been shown to several persons of great       distinction, and even to the king himself. _It is universally       considered as a great curiosity_; and I have taken care to make it       known that you are the person to whom I am indebted, for the first       _Wangarian_ jewel that has ever been seen in England. I have also       shown your letter, containing your judicious opinions upon the       course of the Niger[110], and other geographical points, to Sir       Joseph Banks"]]]
