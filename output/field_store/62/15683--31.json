I understand that I am to report to you for  orders.\"    \"I'm glad to know you, Mr. Harron. This is Operative Carnes of the  Secret Service and Commander Minden of the Coast Guard. We are going to  explore an underground cavern that is located in this vicinity.\"    \"Do you mean the one where they used to smuggle aliens? That is closed  up. I was in charge of that work and we closed it tight as a drum two  years ago.\"    \"Can you find the entrance?\"    \"Sure. It isn't over a mile from here.\"    \"Lead the way, then. We want to take a look at it.\"    The marshal led the way toward the eminence and took a path which led up  a gully in its side. He paused for a moment to take his bearings and  then turned sharply to his left and climbed part way up the side of the  ravine.    \"Here it is,\" he announced. An expression of astonishment crossed his  face and he examined the ground closely. \"By Golly, Doc,\" he went on as  he straightened up, \"this place has been opened since I left it!\"           *       *       *       *       *    Dr. Bird hurried forward and joined him. The heavy stone and concrete  with which the entrance to the cavern had been sealed were undisturbed,  but in the side of the hill was set a steel door beside the concrete.  There was no sign of a keyhole or other means of entering it.    \"Was this steel door part of your work?\" asked Carnes.    \"No, sir, it wasn't. We sealed it solid. That door has been put there  since.\"    Dr. Bird closely examined the structure. He tapped it and went around  the edges and then straightened up and took a small pocket compass from  his pocket and opened the case. The needle swung crazily for a moment  and then pointed straight toward the door.    \"A magnetic lock,\" he exclaimed. \"If we could find the power line it  would be easy to force, but finding that line might take us a week. At  any rate, we have found out what we were after. This is their base from  which they are operating. Mr. Harron, I want you to station a guard  armed with rifles at this door day and night until I personally relieve  you. Remember, until I relieve you, in person. Verbal or written orders  don't go. Capture or kill anyone who tries to enter or leave the cavern  through this entrance. Just now we'll find that cavern more vulnerable  from the sea end, and that is where I mean to attack. We'll force that  door and explore from this end later. Commander Minden, you may stay  here with Mr. Harron, if you like, or you may come with Carnes and me.  We are going on board the _Minneconsin_.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The Mitchell Field plane roared to a take-off and bore south along the  coast. Half an hour of flying brought them in view of the battleship  steaming at full speed up the coast. Dr. Bird radioed instructions to  the ship, and an hour later a launch picked them up from the beach and  took them out. As soon as they were on board they resumed their  progress, and in two hours the peak that Dr. Bird had marked as a  landmark was opposite.    \"Steam in as close to the shore as you can safely,\" he said, \"and then  lower us. Once we are down, you will be guided by our telephoned  instructions. Come on, Carnes, let's go.\"    The detective followed him into the sphere as the _Minneconsin_ edged up  toward the shore. The huge ball was lifted from the deck and lowered  gently into two hundred fathoms of water. It was pitch dark at that  depth, and Dr. Bird switched on one floodlight and studied the cliff  which rose a hundred yards from them.    \"We have missed the place, Carnes,\" he said. \"We'll have them pull us up  a few hundred feet and then steam along the coast.\"    He turned to the telephone and the sphere rose while the battleship  steamed slowly ahead, the vitrilene ball following in her wake. For a  quarter of a mile they continued on their way, and then Dr. Bird halted  the ship.    \"What depth are we?\" he asked. \"Eighty fathoms? All right, lower us,  please.\"           *       *       *       *       *    The ball sank until it rested on the sea bottom, and Dr. Bird turned on  two additional floodlights and studied the surroundings. The bed of the  ocean was literally covered with lobster and crab shell, with the bones  of fish scattered here and there among them. A few bones of land animals  were mixed with the debris and Carnes gave a gasp as Dr. Bird pointed  out to him a diving helmet.    \"We are on the right track,\" said the scientist grimly. He stepped to  the telephone and ordered the sphere raised to one hundred fathoms. The  ship moved forward along the coast until Dr. Bird again stepped to the  telephone and halted it. Before them yawned the entrance to the  underground tunnel. It was about two hundred feet high and three hundred  across, and their most powerful beams would not penetrate to the end of  it. A pile of debris could be seen on the floor of the tunnel and  Carnes fancied that he could see another diving helmet among the litter.  Dr. Bird pointed toward the side of the cavern.    \"See those floodlights fastened to the cliff so that their beams will  sweep across the mouth of the tunnel when they are lighted?\" he said.  \"Apparently the cave is used as a prison and the light beams are the  bars. The creature is not at home just now or the bars would be up. My  God! Look at that, Carnes!\"    Carnes stared and echoed the Doctor's cry of surprise. Clinging to a  shelf of rock which extended out from the wall of the cavern and half  hidden among the seaweed was a huge marine creature. It looked like a  huge black slug with rudimentary eyes and mouth. The thing was fifty  feet in length and fully fifteen feet in diameter. It hung there, moving  sluggishly as though breathing, and rudimentary tentacles projecting  from one end moved in the water.    \"What is it, Doctor?\" asked Carnes in a voice of awe.    \"It is a typical trochosphere of the giant octopus, the devil fish of  Indian Ocean legend, multiplied a thousand times,\" he replied. \"When the  octopus lays its eggs, they hatch out into the larval form. The free  swimming larva is known as a trochosphere, and I am positive that that  is what we see; but look at the size of the thing! Man alive, if that  ever developed, I can't conceive of its dimensions!\"           *       *       *       *       *    \"I have seen pictures of a huge octopus pulling down a ship,\" said  Carnes, \"but I always fancied they were imaginary.\"    \"They are. This monstrosity before us is no product of nature. A dozen  of them would depopulate the seas in a year. It is a hideous parody of  nature conceived in the brain of a madman and produced by some glandular  disturbance. Saranoff spent years in glandular experimentation, and no  doubt he has managed to stimulate the thyroid of a normal octopus and  produce a giant. I fancy that the immediate parent of the thing before  us was of normal size, and so, probably, are its brothers and sisters.  The phenomenon of giantism of this nature occurs in alternate  generations and then only in rare instances. Its grandparent may not be  far away, however. I wish it was safe to use a submarine to explore that  cavern.\"    \"Why isn't it?\"    \"Any creature powerful enough to pull the _Arethusa_ under water would  crush a frail submarine without effort. Anyway, a Navy sub isn't built  for under-water exploration like this ball is. The window space is quite  limited and they aren't equipped with powerful floodlights. I would like  to be able to reach that thing and destroy it, but it can wait until  later. The best thing we can do is to put out our lights and wait.\"    His hand sought the light switch, and the globe became dark. Only a tiny  glimmer of light came down to them from the surface, a hundred fathoms  above. In the darkness they stared into the depths of the sea.           *       *       *       *       *    For an hour they waited and then Dr. Bird grasped Carnes by the  shoulder and pointed. Far in the distance could be seen a tiny point  of light. It wavered and winked and at times disappeared, but it was  gradually approaching them. Dr. Bird stepped to the telephone and the  _Minneconsin_ moved a hundred yards further from the shore. The light  disappeared again as though hidden by some opaque body. Their eyes  had become accustomed to the dim light and they could dimly see a long  snake-like body approach the globe and then suddenly withdraw.    The light appeared again only a few hundred yards away. The water  swirled and the sphere swayed drunkenly as some gigantic body moved past  it with express train speed and entered the mouth of the cavern. The  light turned toward them and they could see the dim outlines of a small  submarine on which it was mounted. Another rush of water came as the  object which had entered the cave started to leave it, and the light  swung around. It bore on a huge black body, and was reflected with a red  glow from huge eyes, and the creature backed again into the cave. Back  and forth across the mouth of the cavern the light played, and the  watchers caught a glimpse of a huge parrot beak which could have  engulfed a freight car. From the cavern projected twisting tentacles of  gargantuan dimensions, and red eyes, thirty feet in diameter, glared  balefully at them. For several minutes the light of the submarine played  across the mouth of the cave, and then the floodlights on the cliff  sprang into full glow and bathed the ball and the mouth of the tunnel in  a flood of light.    Before their horrified gaze was an octopus of a size to make them  disbelieve their eyes. The submarine had moved up to within a few feet  of them, and the light from it played full on the ball. The submarine  maneuvered in the vicinity, keeping the ball full in the beam of its  light, and then drew back. As it did so, the floodlights on the cliff  died out and the beam of the submarine'"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30754"],[0,"The Stones of Venice, Volume 1 (of 3) (#20)"],[1,"block shaft. It is  the best. No other will ever be so agreeable to the mind or eye. I do  not mean that it is not capable of more refined execution, or of the  application of some of the laws of aesthetic beauty, but that it is the  best recipient of execution and subject of law; better in either case  than if you had taken more pains, and cut it straight.    Sec. IV. You will observe, however, that the convexity is to be very  slight, and that the shaft is not to _bulge_ in the centre, but to taper  from the root in a curved line; the peculiar character of the curve you  will discern better by exaggerating, in a diagram, the conditions of its  sculpture.    Let _a_, _a_, _b_, _b_, at A, Fig. XIII., be the rough block of the  shaft, laid on the ground; and as thick as you can by any chance require  it to be; you will leave it of this full thickness at its base at A, but  at the other end you will mark off upon it the diameter _c_, _d_, which  you intend it to have at the summit; you will then take your mallet and  chisel, and working from _c_ and _d_ you will roughly knock off the  corners, shaded in the figure, so as to reduce the shaft to the figure  described by the inside lines in A and the outside lines in B; you then  proceed to smooth it, you chisel away the shaded parts in B, and leave  your finished shaft of the form of the _inside_ lines _e_, _g_, _f_,  _h_.    The result of this operation will be of course that the shaft tapers  faster towards the top than it does near the ground. Observe this  carefully; it is a point of great future importance.    Sec. V. So far of the shape of detached or block shafts. We can carry the  type no farther on merely structural considerations: let us pass to the  shaft of inferior materials.    Unfortunately, in practice, this step must be soon made. It is alike  difficult to obtain, transport, and raise, block shafts more than ten or  twelve feet long, except in remarkable positions, and as pieces of  singular magnificence. Large pillars are therefore always composed of  more than one block of stone. Such pillars are either jointed like  basalt columns, and composed of solid pieces of stone set one above  another; or they are filled up _towers_, built of small stones cemented  into a mass, with more or less of regularity: Keep this distinction  carefully in mind, it is of great importance; for the jointed column,  every stone composing which, however thin, is (so to speak) a complete  _slice_ of the shaft, is just as strong as the block pillar of one  stone, so long as no forces are brought into action upon it which would  have a tendency to cause horizontal dislocation. But the pillar which is  built as a filled-up tower is of course liable to fissure in any  direction, if its cement give way.    But, in either case, it is evident that all constructive reason of the  curved contour is at once destroyed. Far from being an easy or natural  procedure, the fitting of each portion of the curve to its fellow, in  the separate stones, would require painful care and considerable masonic  skill; while, in the case of the filled-up tower, the curve outwards  would be even unsafe; for its greatest strength (and that the more in  proportion to its careless building) lies in its bark, or shell of  outside stone; and this, if curved outwards, would at once burst  outwards, if heavily loaded above.    If, therefore, the curved outline be ever retained in such shafts, it  must be in obedience to aesthetic laws only.    Sec. VI. But farther. Not only the curvature, but even the tapering by  straight lines, would be somewhat difficult of execution in the pieced  column. Where, indeed, the entire shaft is composed of four or five  blocks set one upon another, the diameters may be easily determined at  the successive joints, and the stones chiselled to the same slope. But  this becomes sufficiently troublesome when the joints are numerous, so  that the pillar is like a pile of cheeses; or when it is to be built of  small and irregular stones. We should be naturally led, in the one case,  to cut all the cheeses to the same diameter; in the other to build by  the plumb-line; and in both to give up the tapering altogether.    Sec. VII. Farther. Since the chance, in the one case, of horizontal  dislocation, in the other, of irregular fissure, is much increased by  the composition of the shaft out of joints or small stones, a larger  bulk of shaft is required to carry the given weight; and, _caeteris  paribus_, jointed and cemented shafts must be thicker in proportion to  the weight they carry than those which are of one block.    We have here evidently natural causes of a very marked division in  schools of architecture: one group composed of buildings whose shafts  are either of a single stone or of few joints; the shafts, therefore,  being gracefully tapered, and reduced by successive experiments to the  narrowest possible diameter proportioned to the weight they carry: and  the other group embracing those buildings whose shafts are of many  joints or of small stones; shafts which are therefore not tapered, and  rather thick and ponderous in proportion to the weight they carry; the  latter school being evidently somewhat imperfect and inelegant as  compared with the former.    It may perhaps appear, also, that this arrangement of the materials in  cylindrical shafts at all would hardly have suggested itself to a people  who possessed no large blocks out of which to hew them; and that the  shaft built of many pieces is probably derived from, and imitative of  the shaft hewn from few or from one.    Sec. VIII. If, therefore, you take a good geological map of Europe, and  lay your finger upon the spots where volcanic influences supply either  travertin or marble in accessible and available masses, you will  probably mark the points where the types of the first school have been  originated and developed. If, in the next place, you will mark the  districts where broken and rugged basalt or whinstone, or slaty  sandstone, supply materials on easier terms indeed, but fragmentary and  unmanageable, you will probably distinguish some of the birthplaces of  the derivative and less graceful school. You will, in the first case,  lay your finger on Paestum, Agrigentum, and Athens; in the second, on  Durham and Lindisfarne.    The shafts of the great primal school are, indeed, in their first form,  as massy as those of the other, and the tendency of both is to continual  diminution of their diameters: but in the first school it is a true  diminution in the thickness of the independent pier; in the last, it is  an apparent diminution, obtained by giving it the appearance of a group  of minor piers. The distinction, however, with which we are concerned is  not that of slenderness, but of vertical or curved contour; and we may  note generally that while throughout the whole range of Northern work,  the perpendicular shaft appears in continually clearer development,  throughout every group which has inherited the spirit of the Greek, the  shaft retains its curved or tapered form; and the occurrence of the  vertical detached shaft may at all times, in European architecture, be  regarded as one of the most important collateral evidences of Northern  influence.    Sec. IX. It is necessary to limit this observation to European  architecture, because the Egyptian shaft is often untapered, like the  Northern. It appears that the Central Southern, or Greek shaft, was  tapered or curved on aesthetic rather than constructive principles; and  the Egyptian which precedes, and the Northern which follows it, are both  vertical, the one because the best form had not been discovered, the  other because it could not be attained. Both are in a certain degree  barbaric; and both possess in combination and in their ornaments a power  altogether different from that of the Greek shaft, and at least as  impressive if not as admirable.    Sec. X. We have hitherto spoken of shafts as if their number were fixed,  and only their diameter variable according to the weight to be borne.  But this supposition is evidently gratuitous; for the same weight may be  carried either by many and slender, or by few and massy shafts. If the  reader will look back to Fig. IX., he will find the number of shafts  into which the wall was reduced to be dependent altogether upon the  length of the spaces _a_, _b_, _a_, _b_, &c., a length which was  arbitrarily fixed. We are at liberty to make these spaces of what length  we choose, and, in so doing, to increase the number and diminish the  diameter of the shafts, or _vice versa_.    Sec. XI. Supposing the materials are in each case to be of the same kind,  the choice is in great part at the architect's discretion, only there is  a limit on the one hand to the multiplication of the slender shaft, in  the inconvenience of the narrowed interval, and on the other, to the  enlargement of the massy shaft, in the loss of breadth to the  building.[38] That will be commonly the best proportion which is a  natural mean between the two limits; leaning to the side of grace or of  grandeur according to the expressional intention of the work. I say,  _commonly_ the best, because, in some cases, this expressional invention  may prevail over all other considerations, and a column of unnecessary  bulk or fantastic slightness be adopted in order to strike the spectator  with awe or with surprise.[39] The architect is, however, rarely in  practice compelled to use one kind of material only; and his choice  lies frequently between the employment of a larger number of solid and  perfect small shafts, or a less number of pieced and cemented large  ones. It is often possible to obtain from quarries near at hand, blocks  which might be cut into shafts eight or twelve feet long and four or  five feet round, when larger shafts can only be obtained in distant  localities; and the question then is between the perfection "]]]
