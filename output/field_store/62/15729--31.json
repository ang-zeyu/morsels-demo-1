That which is mentioned  in the Guida di Perugia, as being in a picture of the Resurrection at  the Conventuals, is said to be by Pietro Perugino: and in the Borghese  gallery in Rome, there is one, supposed to be by the hand of Timoteo  della Vite. The portrait in the gallery in Florence, by Da Vinci, bears  some resemblance to Raffaello, but it is not he. Another which I have  seen in Bologna, ought, perhaps, to be ascribed to Giulio Romano. One of  the most authentic portraits of Raffaello, by his own hand, next to the  one in the picture of S. Luke, is that in the Medici Collection in the  _Stanza de' Pittori_, though this is not in his best manner.]    [Footnote 51: Idee de Peintre parfait, chap. xix.]    [Footnote 52: Engraved by Morghen. The three figures, the Madonna, the  Infant, and St. John, appear almost alive. It should seem that Raffaello  made several studies for this picture, and he painted one without the  St. John, which remained for some time in Urbino. I saw a copy in the  possession of the Calamini family, at Recanati, which was said to be by  Baroccio, and at all events belonging to his school. I have seen the  same subject in the Casa Olivieri, at Pesaro, and at Cortona, in the  possession of another noble family, to whom it had passed by inheritance  from Urbino, and was considered to be by Raffaello. The faces in these  are not so beautiful, nor the colours so fine; they are round, and in a  larger circle, with some variations: I have also seen a copy in the  Sacristy of S. Luigi de' Franzesi, in Rome, and in the Palazzo  Giustiniani.]    [Footnote 53: Morto da Feltro sotto Alessandro VI., comincio a dipingere  a grottesco, ma senza stucchi. Baglione, Vite, p. 21.]    [Footnote 54: The entrance into these baths was designedly and  maliciously closed. Serlio, in speaking of the various arabesques in  Pozzuolo, Baja, and Rome, says that they were injured or destroyed by  the artists who had copied them, through a jealous feeling lest others  should also avail themselves of the opportunity of studying them, (lib.  iv. c. 11). The names of these destroyers, which Serlio has suppressed,  posterity has been desirous of recovering, and some have accused  Raffaello, others Pinturicchio, and others Vaga, or Giovanni da Udine,  or rather his scholars and assistants, \"of whom,\" says Vasari, \"there  were an infinite number in every part of Italy.\" This subject is ably  discussed by Mariotti, in _Lettera_ ix. p. 224, and in the _Memorie  delle belle Arti_, per l'anno 1788, p. 24.]    [Footnote 55: It was charged on the office of the Piombo, or papal  signet, when Sebastiano da Venezia was invested with it, and was a  pension of three hundred scudi. Padre Federici observes that the one was  designated Fra Sebastiano, but that the other was not called Fra  Giovanni; nor is this remarkable, for a Bishop is called Monsignore, but  the person who enjoys a pension charged upon a Bishoprick has not the  same title. It cannot however be deduced from this, as Federici wishes  to do, that Sebastiano was first Frate di S. Domenico, by the name of F.  Marco Pensaben, and afterwards secularized by the Pope, and appointed to  the signet, and that he retained the _Fra_ in consequence of his former  situation.]            ROMAN SCHOOL.      EPOCH III.      _The art declines in consequence of the public calamities of    Rome, and gradually falls into mannerism._      After the mournful events of the year 1527, Rome for some time remained  in a state of stupor, contemplating her past misfortunes and her future  destiny; and, like a vessel escaped from shipwreck, began slowly to  repair her numerous losses. The soldiers of the besieging army, among  other injuries committed in the Apostolic palace, had defaced some heads  of Raffaello; and F. Sebastiano, an artist by no means competent to such  a task, was employed to repair them. This, at least, was the opinion of  Titian, who was introduced to these works, and ignorant of the  circumstances, asked Sebastiano what presumptuous wretch had had the  audacity to attempt their restoration;[56] an impartial observation,  against which even the patronage of Michelangiolo could not shield the  artist. Paul III. was now in possession of the papal chair, and under  his auspices the arts again began to revive. The decoration of the  palace of Caprarola, and other works of Paul and his nephews, gave  employment to the painters, and happy had these patrons been, could they  have found a second Raffaello. Bonarruoti, as we have observed, was  engaged by the Pope, and gave to the Roman School many noble specimens  of art, though he formed but few scholars. Sebastiano, after the death  of Raffaello, freed from all further competition with that great artist,  and honoured with the lucrative office of the papal signet, seemed  disposed to rest from his labours; and as he had never, at any time,  discovered great application, he now resigned himself to a life of  vacant leisure, and Vasari does not mention with commendation any pupil  of his school except Laureti.[57] Giulio Romano was now invited back to  Rome, and the superintendence of the building of S. Peter's offered to  him, but death prevented his return to his native city. Perino del Vaga,  however, repaired to Rome, and might, himself, have effected the  restoration of art, if his magnanimity had corresponded with the  sublimity of his mind. But he did not inherit the daring genius of his  master. He communicated his instructions with jealousy, and worked with  a spirit of gain, or to speak correctly, he did not paint himself, but  undertaking works of more or less consequence, he allowed his scholars  to execute them, often to the injury of his own reputation. He continued  to secure to himself artists of the first talents, as we shall see; but  this was done with the intention of making them dependant on him, and to  prevent their interfering with his emoluments and commissions. But  together with the good, he engaged also many indifferent and inferior  artists, whence it happens, that in the chambers of the castle of S.  Angelo, and in other places, we meet with so marked a difference in many  of his works. Few of his scholars attained celebrity. Luzio Romano is  the most noted, and possessed a good execution. Of him there exists a  frieze in the Palazzo Spada; and for some time, too, he had for an  assistant Marcello Venusti of Mantua, a young man of great talents, but  diffident, and probably standing in need of more instruction than Perino  afforded him. He afterwards received some instructions from Bonarruoti,  whose ideas he executed in an excellent manner, as I have mentioned  before, and by his aid he became himself also a good designer.[58]  Perino, by these means, always abounded in work and in money. A similar  traffic in the art was carried on by Taddeo Zuccaro, if we are to  believe Vasari; and by Vasari himself, too, if we may be allowed to  judge from his pictures.    The actual state of the art at this period may be ascertained from a  view of the numerous works produced; but none are so distinguished as  the paintings in the Sala Regia, commenced under Paul III., and scarcely  finished, after a lapse of thirty years, in 1573. Of these Vaga had the  direction, as Raffaello had formerly had, of the chambers of the  Vatican. He planned the compartments, ornamented the ceiling, directed  all the stuccos, cornices, devices, and large figures, and all in the  style of a great master. He then applied himself to design the subjects  for his pencil, and was employed on them when he was carried off by  death in 1547. Through the partiality of Michelangiolo, he was succeeded  by Daniel di Volterra, who had already worked in stucco, under his  direction, in the same place. Volterra resolved to represent the  donations of those sovereigns who had extended or consolidated the  temporal dominion of the church, whence the chamber was called Sala dei  Regi, and this idea was, in some degree, though with variations,  continued by succeeding artists. Volterra was naturally slow and  irresolute, and after painting the Deposition from the Cross, which we  have mentioned as being executed with the assistance of Michelangiolo,  he produced no more of these prodigies of art. He had indeed begun some  designs, but on the death of the Pope, in 1549, he was compelled, in  order to accommodate the conclave, to remove the scaffolding, and expose  the work unfinished. It did not meet with public approbation, nor was it  continued under Julius III., and still less under Paul IV., in whose  reign the art was held in so little respect, that the apostles, painted  by Raffaello in one of the chambers of the Vatican, were displaced.    Pius IV., who resumed the work, on the suggestion of Vasari, in 1561,  had intended to charge Salviati with the entire execution of it; but, by  the intercessions of Bonarruoti, was at length prevailed on to assign  one half of the apartment to Salviati, and the other half to  Ricciarelli, though this did not contribute to expedite the work. Pirro  Ligorio, a Neapolitan, was at this time held in high esteem by the Pope.  He was an antiquarian, though not of great celebrity, but a good  architect, and a fresco painter of some merit;[59] an enthusiast too,  and alike jealous of Ricciarelli, for the homage he paid to Bonarruoti,  and of Salviati, for the respect which he did not shew to Ligorio  himself. Remarking that the Pope wished to hasten the completion of the  work, he proposed to select a number of scholars, and to divide the work  amongst them. Vasari adds, that Salviati was disgusted and left Rome;  where, on his return, he died, without finishing his work; and that  Ricciarelli, who was always slow, never touched it again, and died also  after the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34607"],[0,"Woodcraft and Camping (#20)"],[1,"pted. The  perfect paddling canoe is by no means perfect under canvas, and vice  versa. The best cruiser is not a perfect racer, while neither of them is  at all perfect as a paddling cruiser where much carrying is to be done.  And the most perfect canoe for fishing and gunning around shallow,  marshy waters, would be a very imperfect canoe for a rough and ready  cruise of one hundred miles through a strange wilderness, where a day's  cruise will sometimes include a dozen miles of carrying.    [Sidenote: _A Light Canoe_]    Believing, as I do, that the light, single canoe with double-bladed  paddle is bound to soon become a leading--if not the leading--feature in  summer recreation, and having been a light canoeist for nearly fifty  years, during the last twenty of which I experimented much with the view  of reducing weight, perhaps I can give some hints that may help a  younger man in the selection of a canoe which shall be safe, pleasant to  ride, and not burdensome to carry.    Let me promise that, up to four years ago, I was never able to get a  canoe that entirely satisfied me as to weight and model. I bought the  smallest birches I could find; procured a tiny Chippewa dugout from  North Michigan, and once owned a kayak. They were all too heavy, and  they were cranky to a degree.    About twenty years ago I commenced making my own canoes. The  construction was of the simplest; a 22-inch pine board for the bottom,  planed to 3/4 of an inch thickness; two wide 1/2-inch boards for the  sides, and two light oak stems; five pieces of wood in all. I found that  the bend of the siding gave too much shear; for instance, if the siding  was 12 inches wide, she would have a rise of 12 inches at stems and less  than 5 inches at center. But the flat bottom made her very stiff, and  for river work she was better than anything I had yet tried. She was too  heavy, however, always weighing from 45 to 50 pounds, and awkward to  carry.    My last canoe of this style went down the Susquehanna with an ice jam  in the spring of '79, and in the meantime canoeing began to loom up. The  best paper in the country which makes out-door sport a specialty,  devoted liberal space to canoeing, and skilled boatbuilders were  advertising canoes of various models and widely different material. I  commenced interviewing the builders by letter, and studying catalogues  carefully. There was a wide margin of choice. You could have lapstreak,  smooth skin, paper, veneer, or canvas. What I wanted was light weight,  and good model. I liked the Peterboro canoes; they were decidedly  canoey. Also, the veneered Racines; but neither of them talked of a  20-pound canoe. The \"Osgood folding canvas\" did. But I had some  knowledge of canvas boats. I knew they could make her down to 20 pounds.  How much would she weigh after being in the water a week, and how would  she behave when swamped in the middle of a lake, were questions to be  asked, for I always get swamped. One builder of cedar canoes thought he  could make me the boat I wanted, inside of 20 pounds, clinker-built, and  at my own risk, as he hardly believed in so light a boat. I sent him the  order, and he turned out what is pretty well known in Brown's Tract as  the \"Nessmuk canoe.\" She weighed just 17 pounds 13-3/4 ounces, and was  thought to be the lightest working canoe in existence. Her builder gave  me some advice about stiffening her with braces, etc., if I found her  too frail, \"and he never expected another like her.\"    \"He builded better than he knew.\" She needed no bracing; and she was,  and is, a staunch, seaworthy little model. I fell in love with her from  the start. I had at last found the canoe that I could ride in rough  water, sleep in afloat, and carry with ease for miles. I paddled her  early and late, mainly on the Fulton Chain; but I also cruised her on  Raquette Lake, Eagle, Utowana, Blue Mountain, and Forked Lakes. I  paddled her until there were black and blue streaks along the muscles  from wrist to elbow. Thank Heaven, I had found something that made me a  boy again. Her log shows a cruise for 1880 of over 550 miles.    As regards her capacity (she is now on Third Lake, Brown's Tract), James  P. Fifield, a muscular young Forge House guide of 6 feet 2 inches and  185 pounds weight, took her through the Fulton Chain to Raquette Lake  last summer; and, happening on his camp, Seventh Lake, last July, I  asked him how she performed under his weight. He said, \"I never made the  trip to Raquette so lightly and easily in my life.\" And as to the  opinion of her builder, he wrote me, under date of Nov. 18, '83: \"I  thought when I built the Nessmuk, no one else would ever want one. But I  now build about a dozen of them a year. Great big men, ladies, and two,  aye, three schoolboys ride in them. It is wonderful how few pounds of  cedar, rightly modeled and properly put together, it takes to float a  man.\" Just so, Mr. Builder. That's what I said when I ordered her. But  few seemed to see it then.    [Sidenote: _Experiments_]    The Nessmuk was by no means the ultimatum of lightness, and I ordered  another six inches longer, two inches wider, and to weigh about 15  pounds. When she came to hand she was a beauty, finished in oil and  shellac. But she weighed 16 pounds, and would not only carry me and my  duffle, but I could easily carry a passenger of my weight. I cruised her  in the summer of '81 over the Fulton Chain, Raquette Lake, Forked Lake,  down the Raquette River, and on Long Lake. But her log only showed a  record of 206 miles. The cruise that had been mapped for 600 miles was  cut short by sickness, and I went into quarantine at the hostelry of  Mitchell Sabattis. Slowly and feebly I crept back to the Fulton Chain,  hung up at the Forge House, and the cruise of the Susan Nipper was  ended. Later in the season, I sent for her, and she was forwarded by  express, coming out over the fearful Brown's Tract road to Boonville  (25-1/2 miles) by buckboard. From Boonville home, she took her chances  in the baggage car without protection, and reached her destination  without a check or scratch. She hangs in her slings under the porch, a  thing of beauty--and, like many beauties, a trifle frail--but staunch as  the day I took her. Her proper lading is about 200 pounds. She can float  300 pounds.    Of my last and lightest venture, the Sairy Gamp, little more need be  said. I will only add that a Mr. Dutton, of Philadelphia, got into her  at the Forge House, and paddled her like an old canoeist, though it was  his first experience with the double blade. He gave his age as  sixty-four years, and weight, 140 pounds. Billy Cornell, a bright young  guide, cruised her on Raquette Lake quite as well as her owner could do  it, and I thought she trimmed better with him. He paddled at 141-1/2  pounds, which is just about her right lading. And she was only an  experiment, anyhow. I wanted to find out how light a canoe it took to  drown her skipper, and I do not yet know. I never shall. But, most of  all, I desired to settle the question--approximately at least, of  weight, as regards canoe and canoeist.    Many years ago, I became convinced that we were all, as canoeists,  carrying and paddling just twice as much wood as was at all needful, and  something more than a year since, I advanced the opinion in _Forest and  Stream_, that ten pounds of well made cedar ought to carry one hundred  pounds of man. The past season has more than proved it; but, as I may be  a little exceptional, I leave myself out of the question, and have  ordered my next canoe on lines and dimensions that, in my judgment, will  be found nearly perfect for the average canoeist of 150 to 160 pounds.  She will be much stronger than either of my other canoes, because few  men would like a canoe so frail and limber that she can be sprung inward  by hand pressure on the gunwales, as easily as a hat-box. And many men  are clumsy or careless with a boat, while others are lubberly by nature.  Her dimensions are: Length, 10-1/2 feet; beam, 26 inches; rise at  center, 9 inches; at seams, 15 inches; oval red elm ribs, 1 inch apart;  an inch home tumble; stems, plumb and sharp; oak keel and keelson;  clinker-built, of white cedar.    Such a canoe will weigh about 22 pounds, and will do just as well for  the man of 140 or 170 pounds, while even a light weight of 110 pounds  ought to take her over a portage with a light, elastic carrying frame,  without distress. She will trim best, however, at about 160 pounds. For  a welter, say of some 200 pounds, add 6 inches to her length, 2 inches  to her beam, and 1 inch rise at center. The light weight canoeist will  find that either of these two canoes will prove satisfactory, that is 10  feet in length, weight 16 pounds, or 10-1/2 feet length, weight 18  pounds. Either is capable of 160 pounds, and they are very steady and  buoyant, as I happen to know. I dare say any first class manufacturers  will build canoes of these dimensions.    Provide your canoe with a flooring of oil-cloth 3-1/2 feet long by 15  inches wide; punch holes in it and tie it neatly to the ribbing, just  where it will best protect the bottom from wear and danger. Use only a  cushion for a seat, and do not buy a fancy one with permanent stuffing,  but get sixpence worth of good, unbleached cotton cloth, and have it  sewed into bag shape. Stuff the bag with fine browse, dry grass or  leaves, settle it well together, and fasten the open end by turning it  flatly back and using two or three pins. You can empty it if you like  when going over a carry, and it makes a good pillow at night.    [Sidenote: _The Proper Craft_]    Select a canoe that fits you, just as you would a coat or hat. A  16-pound canoe may fit me exactly, but would be a bad misfit for a man  of 180 pounds. And don't neglect the auxiliary paddle, or \"pudding  stick,\" as my friends call it. The notion may be new to most canoeists,  but will be"]]]
