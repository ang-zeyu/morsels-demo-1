In remote localities, quite large colonies of  them may still be found, but where they numbered thousands, years ago,  they can be counted by dozens now. They breed in impenetrable swamps,  very often in company with the following species, and also with  Louisiana and Little Blue Herons, and White Ibises. Their nests are but  frail platforms, generally in bushes over the water. Their usual  complement of eggs numbers from three to five, four as the most common  number. They are generally laid during the latter part of May, but often  on account of their being disturbed, nests with eggs may be found in  July. The eggs are a light bluish green in color. Size 2.25 x 1.45.  Data.--Gainesville, Florida, April 14, 1894. Four eggs on a platform of  sticks and grass, in a button-wood bush over six feet of water.  Collector, George Graham.      197. SNOWY EGRET. _Egretta candidissima candidissima._    Range.--Common now only in restricted localities in the Gulf States and  Mexico.    This species, which is smaller than the last, being but twenty-four  inches in length, is also adorned with \"aigrettes,\" but they are  beautifully recurved at the tips. Owing to the merciless slaughter to  which they have been subjected, their ranks have been woefully  decimated, and it is to be hoped that the remaining ones may be safely  protected. Their nesting habits are the same as the last, although, of  course, the eggs are smaller. Size 1.80 x 1.25.    [Illustration 124: Snowy Egret. Egret.]  [Illustration: Light greenish blue.]  [Illustration: left hand margin.]    Page 123    198. REDDISH EGRET. _Dichromanassa rufescens._    Range.--In the United States, this species is confined chiefly to the  Gulf States.    It is somewhat larger than the last species, the head and neck are  rufous, the body is bluish gray, and the back is adorned with slender  gray plumes. It also has a white phase. This Egret is very abundant  along the whole Gulf coast, but especially so in Texas. Their nesting  habits are identical with those of the other small Herons and Egrets.  The three or four eggs are rather of a more greenish blue than the  preceding. Size 1.90 x 1.45. Data.--Gainesville, Florida, April 14,  1894. Three eggs. Nest of sticks and straw in a button-wood tree, two  feet above the water. Collector, George Graham.      199. LOUISIANA HERON. _Hydranassa tricolor ruficollis._    Range.--Sub-tropical America, north regularly to the Gulf States and  casually farther.    This Heron is of about the size of the Reddish Egret, but the neck is  longer, more slender and dark, while the chin, throat and underparts are  white. The plumes from the back are short, reaching barely to the end of  the tail. They nest in large colonies in company with Egrets and Little  Blue Herons, placing their nests in the mangroves, only a few feet above  the water. Their nests are the same as those of the other species, a  slight platform of sticks, and the three to five eggs are practically  not distinguishable from those of the Snowy or Little Blue Herons. Size  1.75 x 1.35.    [Illustration 125: Pale bluish green.]  [Illustration: Reddish Egret. Louisiana Heron.]  [Illustration: Pale bluish green.]  [Illustration: right hand margin.]    Page 124    200. LITTLE BLUE HERON. _Florida caerulea._    Range.--South Atlantic and Gulf coasts, north casually to New England  and Manitoba; west to Kansas and Nebraska.    A smaller species than the preceding, length 22 inches, plumage a  uniform slaty blue changing to purplish red on the head and neck. They  also have a white phase, but always show traces of the slaty blue,  especially on the primaries. Young birds are always white. They breed in  immense rookeries during April and May. Their nesting habits and eggs  are very similar to the last species, although the eggs average a trifle  smaller. Size 1.75 x 1.25. Data.--Avery's Island, Louisiana, April 21,  1896. 5 eggs. Nest a flat and frail platform of twigs in a Mimosa tree  growing in floating turf, over deep water in a large swamp. Collector,  E. A. McIlhenny.      201. GREEN HERON. _Butorides virescens virescens._    Range.--Temperate and sub-tropical America, breeding north to the  British Provinces.    This is the smallest of our Herons, and is well known all over the  country. Sometimes they breed in numbers in rookeries, in company with  the larger Herons, but in most sections of the country they will be  found nesting, one or two pairs together, along the border of some swamp  or stream. They have a greater diversity of building sites, than do any  of the other Herons and frequently nest a long ways from water. Their  nests may be found in alders, birches or even apple trees. It is the  usual Heron type of platform, upon which the three to six eggs are laid.  They are a pale greenish blue in color, and measure 1.45 x 1.10.  Data.--Avery's Island, Louisiana, April 10, 1894. 5 eggs on a platform  of twigs placed in a willow tree growing on the edge of a pond.  Collected by E. A. McIlhenny.

FRAZAR'S GREEN HERON. _Butorides virescens frazari._    A darker variety found in Lower California; nesting the same as the  common species.    201b. ANTHONY'S GREEN HERON. _Butorides virescens anthonyi._    A lighter, desert form found in the arid portions of the interior of  southwestern United States and Mexico.    [Illustration 127: NEST AND EGGS OF GREEN HERON.]  [Illustration: right hand margin.]    Page 126    202. BLACK-CROWNED NIGHT HERON. _Nycticorax nycticorax naevius_.    Range.--North America from southern British Provinces, southward;  winters along the Gulf coast and beyond.    A well known bird, often called \"quawk\" from the sound of its note  frequently heard in the evening. While, in some localities, only a few  pairs of these birds are found nesting together, most of them gather  together into large colonies during the breeding season. In New England  they generally select a remote pine grove as their breeding grounds. If  not disturbed they will return to this same place each year. Their nests  are built of sticks and lined with small twigs, and are placed well up  towards the tops of the trees.    Frequently several nests will be found in the same tree, and I have  counted as many as fifty nests in view at the same time. In large swamps  in the south they generally nest at a low elevation, while in the  marshes of Wisconsin and Minnesota, large colonies of them nest on the  ground, making their nest of rushes. Like all Heronries, those of this  species have a nauseating odor, from the remains of decayed fish, etc.,  which are strewn around the bases of the trees. Their eggs number from  three to five and are of a pale bluish green color. Size 2.00 x 1.40.  Data.--Uxbridge, Mass., May 30, 1898. 4 eggs. Nest of sticks, about  thirty feet up in a pine tree. Many other nests. Collector, H. A. Smith.      203. YELLOW-CROWNED NIGHT HERON. _Nyctanassa violacea_.    Range.--Sub-tropical America, breeding along the Gulf coast and to Lower  California; casually farther north, to Illinois and South Carolina.    A handsome grayish colored species, with long lanceolate plumes on the  back, and two or three fine white plumes from the back of the head, like  those of the Black-crowned species. Its black head, with tawny white  crown and ear coverts, renders it unmistakable. This species nests in  colonies or by pairs, like the preceding, and very often in company with  other Herons. They lay from three to six eggs, very similar in size,  shape and color to those of the Black-crowned Heron.    [Illustration 128: Pale bluish green.]  [Illustration: Black-crowned Night Heron. Yellow-crowned Heron.]  [Illustration: left hand margin.]    Page 127    CRANES, RAILS, etc. Order VIII. PALUDICOLAE    CRANES. Family GRUIDAE    Cranes are large, long-legged, long-necked birds, somewhat resembling  Herons. Their structure and mode of living partakes more of the nature  of the Rails, however. They are found upon the prairies, where besides  shell fish from the ponds, they feed largely upon grasshoppers, worms,  etc.      204. WHOOPING CRANE. _Grus americana._    Range.--Interior of North America, breeding from about the latitude of  Iowa northward to the Arctic regions; winters in the Gulf states and  southward.    The Whooping Crane is the largest of the family in America, measuring 50  inches or more in length. The plumage of the adults is pure white, with  black primaries. The bare parts of the head and face are carmine. It is  a very locally distributed species, in some sections being practically  unknown, while in a neighboring locality it may be rated as common. They  are very shy birds and are not easily obtained. They nest either upon  the solid earth or in marshy places over the water. In either case the  nest is a very bulky mass of grass and weeds from two to three feet in  diameter and raised perhaps a foot above the ground. They lay two eggs  of a brownish buff color, irregularly blotched with brown, and with  fainter marking of gray. Size 3.75 x 2.50. Data.--Torkton, northern  Assiniboia, northwest Canada. Nest a mass of marsh hay, three feet in  diameter, on the prairie. The birds seen, but very wary. Collector,  Cowbry Brown.      205. LITTLE BROWN CRANE. _Grus canadensis._    Range.--North America in the interior, breeding from Hudson Bay and  southern Alaska north to the Arctic coast; south in winter to Mexico.    This uniform gray colored Crane differs from the next species only in  size, being about three feet in length, while the Sandhill averages  three and one-half feet. The eggs cannot be distinguished with any  certainty.    [Illustration 129: Whooping Crane.

Perhaps they had not treated him very well, but his prejudice  against them was very constant and conspicuous. One day, in the Hall of  the Four Courts, an attorney came up to him to beg a subscription  towards burying a brother attorney who had died in distressed  circumstances. Parsons took out a one-pound note and tendered it. \"Oh,  Mr. Parsons,\" said the applicant, \"I do not want so much--I only ask a  shilling from each contributor. I have limited myself to that, and I  cannot really take more.\"--\"Oh, take it, take it,\" said Parsons; \"for  God's sake, my good sir, take the pound, and while you are at it bury  twenty of them.\"    There is a terseness in the following which seems to be inimitable.  Lord Norbury was travelling with Parsons; they passed a gibbet.  \"Parsons,\" said Norbury, with a chuckle, \"where would _you_ be now if  every one had his due?\"--\"Alone in my carriage,\" replied Parsons.           *       *       *       *       *    Here is a young Irishman's first Bar-speech. \"Your lordships perceive  that we stand here as our grandmothers' administrators _de bonis non_;  and really, my lords, it does strike me that it would be a monstrous  thing to say that a party can now come in, in the very teeth of an Act  of Parliament, and actually turn us round, under colour of hanging us  up, on the foot of a contract made behind our backs.\"    A learned Serjeant MacMahon was noted for his confusion of language in  his efforts to be sublime. He cared less for the sense than the sound.  As, for example: \"Gentlemen of the jury, I smell a rat--but I'll nip it  in the bud.\" And, \"My client acted boldly. He saw the storm brewing in  the distance, but he was not dismayed! He took the bull by the horns and  he _indicted him for perjury_.\"    Peter Burrowes, a well-known member of the Irish Bar, was on one  occasion counsel for the prosecution at an important trial for murder.  Burrowes had a severe cold, and opened his speech with a box of lozenges  in one hand and in the other the small pistol bullet by which the man  had met his death. Between the pauses of his address he kept supplying  himself with a lozenge. But at last, in the very middle of a  'high-falutin' period, he stopped. His legal chest heaved, his eyes  seemed starting from his head, and in a voice tremulous with fright he  exclaimed: \"Oh! h-h!!! Gentlemen, gentlemen; I've swallowed the  bul-let!\"    An Irish counsel who was once asked by the judge for whom he was  \"concerned,\" replied: \"My lord, I am retained by the defendant, and  therefore I am concerned for the plaintiff.\"    A junior at the Bar in course of his speech began to use a simile of  \"the eagle soaring high above the mists of the earth, winning its daring  flight against a midday sun till the contemplation becomes too dazzling  for humanity, and mortal eyes gaze after it in vain.\" Here the orator  was noticed to falter and lose the thread of his speech, and sat down  after some vain attempts to regain it; the judge remarking: \"The next  time, sir, you bring an eagle into Court, I should recommend you to clip  its wings.\"    Mr. Tim Healy's power of effective and stinging repartee is probably  unexcelled. He is seldom at a loss for a retort, and there are not a few  politicians and others who regret having been foolish enough to rouse  his resentment. There is on record, however, an amusing interlude in the  passing of which Tim was discomfited--crushed, and found himself unable  to \"rise to the occasion.\"    During the hearing of a case at the Recorder's Court in Dublin the  Testament on which the witnesses were being sworn disappeared. After a  lengthy hunt for it, counsel for the defendant noticed that Mr. Healy  had taken possession of the book, and was deeply absorbed in its  contents, and quite unconscious of the dismay its disappearance was  causing.    \"I think, sir,\" said the counsel, addressing the Recorder, \"that Mr.  Healy has the Testament.\" Hearing his name mentioned, Mr. Healy looked  up, realised what had occurred, and, with apologies, handed it over.    \"You see, sir,\" added the counsel, \"Mr. Healy was so interested that he  did not know of our loss. He took it for a new publication.\" For once  Mr. Healy's nimble wit failed him, and forced him to submit to the  humiliation of being scored off.    In the North of Ireland the peasantry pronounce the word witness  \"wetness.\" At Derry Assizes a man said he had brought his \"wetness\" with  him to corroborate his evidence. \"Bless me,\" said the judge, \"about what  age are you?\"--\"Forty-two my last birthday, my lord,\" replied the  witness. \"Do you mean to tell the jury,\" said the judge, \"that at your  age you still have a wet nurse?\"--\"Of course I have, my lord.\" Counsel  hereupon interposed and explained.    The witness who gave the following valuable testimony, however, was  probably keeping strictly to fact. \"I sees Phelim on the top of the  wall. 'Paddy,' he says. 'What,' says I. 'Here,' says he. 'Where?' says  I. 'Hush,' says he. 'Whist,' says I. And that's all.\"    The wit of the Irish Bar seems to infect even the officers of the Courts  and the people who enter the witness-box. It is impossible, for example,  not to admire the fine irony of the usher who, when he was told to clear  the Court, called out: \"All ye blaggards that are not lawyers lave the  building.\"    Irish judges have much greater difficulties to contend against, because  the people with whom they have to deal have a fund of ready retort.  \"Sir,\" said an exasperated Irish judge to a witness who refused to  answer the questions put to him--\"sir, this is a contempt of Court.\"--\"I  know it, my lord, but I was endeavouring to concale it,\" was the  irresistible reply.    A certain Irish attorney threatening to prosecute a printer for  inserting in his paper the death of a person still living, informed him  that \"No person should publish a death unless informed of the fact by  the party deceased.\"    A rather amusing story is told of a trial where one of the Irish jurymen  had been \"got at\" and bribed to secure the jury agreeing to a verdict of  \"Manslaughter,\" however much they might want to return one upon the  capital charge of \"Murder.\" The jury were out for several hours, and it  was believed that eventually the result would be that they would not  agree upon a verdict at all. However, close upon midnight, they were  starved into one, and it was that of \"Manslaughter.\" Next day the  particular juryman concerned received his promised reward, and in paying  it, the man who had arranged it for him remarked: \"I suppose you had a  great deal of difficulty in getting the other jurymen to agree to a  verdict of 'Manslaughter'?\"--\"I should just think I did,\" replied the  man. \"I had to knock it into them, for all the others--the whole eleven  of them--wanted to acquit him.\"    An Irish lawyer addressed the Court as _Gentlemen_ instead of _Your  Honours_. When he had concluded, a brother lawyer pointed out his error.  He immediately rose and apologised thus: \"In the heat of the debate I  called your honours gentlemen,--I made a mistake, your honours.\"          CHAPTER FIVE    THE JUDGES OF SCOTLAND          \"Ye Barristers of England        Your triumphs idle are,      Till ye can match the names that ring        Round Caledonia's Bar.      Your _John Doe_ and your Richard Roe        Are but a paltry pair:      Look at those who compose        The flocks round Brodie's Stair,      Who ruminate on Shaw and Tait        And flock round Brodie's Stair.        *       *       *       *       *        \"But, Barristers of England,        Come to us lovingly,      And any Scot who greets you not        We'll send to Coventry.      Put past your brief, embark for Leith,        And when you've landed there,      Any wight with delight        Will point out Brodie's Stair      Or lead you all through Fountainhall        Till you enter Brodie's Stair.\"        OUTRAM: _Legal and other Lyrics_.          CHAPTER FIVE    THE JUDGES OF SCOTLAND      From the Institution of the Court of Session by James V of Scotland till  well into the nineteenth century, it was the custom of Scottish judges  when taking their seat on the Bench to assume a title from an estate--it  might even be from a farm--already in their own or their family's  possession. So we find that nearly every parish in Scotland has given  birth to a judge who by this practice has made that parish or an estate  in it more or less familiar to Scottish ears. Monboddo, near Fordoun, in  Kincardineshire, at once recalls the judge who gave \"attic suppers\" in  his house in St. John Street, Edinburgh, and held a theory that all  infants were born with tails like monkeys; but under the modern practice  of simply adding \"Lord\" to his surname of Burnet, we doubt if his  eccentric personality would be so readily remembered. Lord Dirleton's  _Doubts_, Lord Fountainhall's _Historical Observes_, carry a more  imposing sound in their titles than if those one-time indispensable  works of reference had been simply named Nisbet on Legal Doubts, and  Lauder on Historical Observations of Memorable Events.    The selection of a title was an important matter with these old judges.  When Lauder was raised to the Bench, his estate to the south-east of  Edinburgh was called Woodhead; but it would never have done for a  Senator of the College of Justice to be known as \"Lord Woodhead,\" so the  name of the estate was changed to Fountainhall, and as Lord Fountainhall  he took his seat among \"the Fifteen\" as the full Bench of judges was  then termed.    These old-time judges with their rugged "]]]
