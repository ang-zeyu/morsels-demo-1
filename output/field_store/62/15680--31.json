CHAPTER XXV: OF THE TRIUMPHANT SUMMER ARRAY OF THE MAID      When the day was bright Walter arose, and met the Maid coming from the  river-bank, fresh and rosy from the water.  She paled a little when they  met face to face, and she shrank from him shyly.  But he took her hand  and kissed her frankly; and the two were glad, and had no need to tell  each other of their joy, though much else they deemed they had to say,  could they have found words thereto.    So they came to their fire and sat down, and fell to breakfast; and ere  they were done, the Maid said: \"My Master, thou seest we be come nigh  unto the hill-country, and to-day about sunset, belike, we shall come  into the Land of the Bear-folk; and both it is, that there is peril if we  fall into their hands, and that we may scarce escape them.  Yet I deem  that we may deal with the peril by wisdom.\"    \"What is the peril?\" said Walter; \"I mean, what is the worst of it?\"    Said the Maid: \"To be offered up in sacrifice to their God.\"    \"But if we escape death at their hands, what then?\" said Walter.    \"One of two things,\" said she; \"the first that they shall take us into  their tribe.\"    \"And will they sunder us in that case?\" said Walter.    \"Nay,\" said she.    Walter laughed and said: \"Therein is little harm then.  But what is the  other chance?\"    Said she: \"That we leave them with their goodwill, and come back to one  of the lands of Christendom.\"    Said Walter: \"I am not all so sure that this is the better of the two  choices, though, forsooth, thou seemest to think so.  But tell me now,  what like is their God, that they should offer up new-comers to him?\"    \"Their God is a woman,\" she said, \"and the Mother of their nation and  tribes (or so they deem) before the days when they had chieftains and  Lords of Battle.\"    \"That will be long ago,\" said he; \"how then may she be living now?\"    Said the Maid: \"Doubtless that woman of yore agone is dead this many and  many a year; but they take to them still a new woman, one after other, as  they may happen on them, to be in the stead of the Ancient Mother.  And  to tell thee the very truth right out, she that lieth dead in the  Pillared Hall was even the last of these; and now, if they knew it, they  lack a God.  This shall we tell them.\"    \"Yea, yea!\" said Walter, \"a goodly welcome shall we have of them then, if  we come amongst them with our hands red with the blood of their God!\"    She smiled on him and said: \"If I come amongst them with the tidings that  I have slain her, and they trow therein, without doubt they shall make me  Lady and Goddess in her stead.\"    \"This is a strange word,\" said Walter \"but if so they do, how shall that  further us in reaching the kindreds of the world, and the folk of Holy  Church?\"    She laughed outright, so joyous was she grown, now that she knew that his  life was yet to be a part of hers.  \"Sweetheart,\" she said, \"now I see  that thou desirest wholly what I desire; yet in any case, abiding with  them would be living and not dying, even as thou hadst it e'en now.  But,  forsooth, they will not hinder our departure if they deem me their God;  they do not look for it, nor desire it, that their God should dwell with  them daily.  Have no fear.\"  Then she laughed again, and said: \"What!  thou lookest on me and deemest me to be but a sorry image of a goddess;  and me with my scanty coat and bare arms and naked feet!  But wait!  I  know well how to array me when the time cometh.  Thou shalt see it!  And  now, my Master, were it not meet that we took to the road?\"    So they arose, and found a ford of the river that took the Maid but to  the knee, and so set forth up the greensward of the slopes whereas there  were but few trees; so went they faring toward the hill-country.    At the last they were come to the feet of the very hills, and in the  hollows betwixt the buttresses of them grew nut and berry trees, and the  greensward round about them was both thick and much flowery.  There they  stayed them and dined, whereas Walter had shot a hare by the way, and  they had found a bubbling spring under a grey stone in a bight of the  coppice, wherein now the birds were singing their best.    When they had eaten and had rested somewhat, the Maid arose and said:  \"Now shall the Queen array herself, and seem like a very goddess.\"    Then she fell to work, while Walter looked on; and she made a garland for  her head of eglantine where the roses were the fairest; and with mingled  flowers of the summer she wreathed her middle about, and let the garland  of them hang down to below her knees; and knots of the flowers she made  fast to the skirts of her coat, and did them for arm-rings about her  arms, and for anklets and sandals for her feet.  Then she set a garland  about Walter's head, and then stood a little off from him and set her  feet together, and lifted up her arms, and said: \"Lo now! am I not as  like to the Mother of Summer as if I were clad in silk and gold? and even  so shall I be deemed by the folk of the Bear.  Come now, thou shalt see  how all shall be well.\"    She laughed joyously; but he might scarce laugh for pity of his love.  Then they set forth again, and began to climb the hills, and the hours  wore as they went in sweet converse; till at last Walter looked on the  Maid, and smiled on her, and said: \"One thing I would say to thee, lovely  friend, to wit: wert thou clad in silk and gold, thy stately raiment  might well suffer a few stains, or here and there a rent maybe; but  stately would it be still when the folk of the Bear should come up  against thee.  But as to this flowery array of thine, in a few hours it  shall be all faded and nought.  Nay, even now, as I look on thee, the  meadow-sweet that hangeth from thy girdle-stead has waxen dull, and  welted; and the blossoming eyebright that is for a hem to the little  white coat of thee is already forgetting how to be bright and blue.  What  sayest thou then?\"    She laughed at his word, and stood still, and looked back over her  shoulder, while with her fingers she dealt with the flowers about her  side like to a bird preening his feathers.  Then she said: \"Is it verily  so as thou sayest?  Look again!\"    So he looked, and wondered; for lo! beneath his eyes the spires of the  meadow-sweet grew crisp and clear again, the eyebright blossoms shone  once more over the whiteness of her legs; the eglantine roses opened, and  all was as fresh and bright as if it were still growing on its own roots.    He wondered, and was even somedeal aghast; but she said: \"Dear friend, be  not troubled! did I not tell thee that I am wise in hidden lore?  But in  my wisdom shall be no longer any scathe to any man.  And again, this my  wisdom, as I told thee erst, shall end on the day whereon I am made all  happy.  And it is thou that shall wield it all, my Master.  Yet must my  wisdom needs endure for a little season yet.  Let us on then, boldly and  happily.\"          CHAPTER XXVI: THEY COME TO THE FOLK OF THE BEARS      On they went, and before long they were come up on to the down-country,  where was scarce a tree, save gnarled and knotty thorn-bushes here and  there, but nought else higher than the whin.  And here on these upper  lands they saw that the pastures were much burned with the drought,  albeit summer was not worn old.  Now they went making due south toward  the mountains, whose heads they saw from time to time rising deep blue  over the bleak greyness of the down-land ridges.  And so they went, till  at last, hard on sunset, after they had climbed long over a high bent,  they came to the brow thereof, and, looking down, beheld new tidings.    There was a wide valley below them, greener than the downs which they had  come over, and greener yet amidmost, from the watering of a stream which,  all beset with willows, wound about the bottom.  Sheep and neat were  pasturing about the dale, and moreover a long line of smoke was going up  straight into the windless heavens from the midst of a ring of little  round houses built of turfs, and thatched with reed.  And beyond that,  toward an eastward-lying bight of the dale, they could see what looked  like to a doom-ring of big stones, though there were no rocky places in  that land.  About the cooking-fire amidst of the houses, and here and  there otherwhere, they saw, standing or going to and fro, huge figures of  men and women, with children playing about betwixt them.    They stood and gazed down at it for a minute or two, and though all were  at peace there, yet to Walter, at least, it seemed strange and awful.  He  spake softly, as though he would not have his voice reach those men,  though they were, forsooth, out of earshot of anything save a shout: \"Are  these then the children of the Bear?  What shall we do now?\"    She said: \"Yea, of the Bear they be, though there be other folks of them  far and far away to the northward and eastward, near to the borders of  the sea.  And as to what we shall do, let us go down at once, and  peacefully.  Indeed, by now there will be no escape from them; for lo  you! they have seen us.\"    Forsooth, some three or four of the big men had turned them toward the  bent whereon stood the twain, and were hailing them in huge, rough  voices, wherein, howsoever, seemed to be no anger or threat.  So the Maid  took Walter by the hand, and thus they went down quietly, and the Bear-  folk, seeing them, stood all together, facing them, to abide their  coming.  Walter saw of them, that though they were very tall and bigly  made, they were not so far above the stature of men as to be marvels.  The  carles were long-haired, and shaggy of beard, and their hair all red or  tawny; their skins, where their naked flesh showed, were burned brown  with sun and weather, but to a fair and pleasant brown, nought like"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30550"],[0,"Finn The Wolfhound (#20)"],[1,"his gentle melancholy. But Finn's nose told him  plainly that he had never before been on these particular Downs.  And so, good and kindly as this ancient British soil was to him, it  brought him no sight of actual home.    Towards evening he coursed and killed another rabbit, eating half  of it, and providing, in the other half which he left, a  substantial repast for a prowling weasel who followed in his trail.    Something--it may have been merely the fact that the day had not  been in any way exhausting like its predecessors--prevented Finn  from being inclined to curl down and sleep, when he passed a  convenient wheat rick in a valley an hour after his supper. The  night was fine and clear, and night life in the open, with its many  mysterious rustlings, bird and animal calls, and other enticing  sounds and smells, was beginning to present considerable  attractions to Finn. The events of the past few days had aroused  all sorts of latent tendencies and inclinations in him; feelings  which resembled memories of bygone days in their effects upon him,  but yet were not memories of any life that he had known, though  they may have been blood memories of the experiences of his  forbears. Later on, however, the young Wolfhound began to tire of  the freedom of the night, and home-sick longings rose in his heart  as he thought of the coach-house and of Kathleen. It was at about  this time that Finn fell to walking along a narrow, white sheep-walk,  on the side of a big, billowy down, which seemed to him  pleasanter and more homely than any of the hills he had traversed  that evening. Gradually the track in the chalk deepened and widened  a little, until it became a path sunk in the hill-side to a depth  of fifteen or twenty feet, and ended in a five-barred gate beside a  road. Finn leaped the gate with a strange feeling of exultation in  his heart, which made him careless of the sharp pain the leap  brought to his side. Something rose in his throat as he reached the  road. His eyes became misty, his nose drooped eagerly to the  surface of the road, and he whimpered softly as he ran, with tail  swaying from side to side, and a great tenderness welling up within  him.    Two minutes later he came to a white gate leading to a shrub-sheltered  garden before a small, low, rambling little house. He  leaped the little gate, and turned sharply to the right in the  garden. But then his way was blocked by high doors, set in masonry,  which could not possibly be climbed or jumped. Before these gates,  which evidently led to the stables and rear of the house, Finn sat  down on his haunches. Then he lifted his long muzzle heavenward and  howled lugubriously. He continued his howling steadily for about  one minute and a half, and at the end of that time a door opened  behind him in the front of the house, and a man clad in pyjamas  rushed out into the garden. Finn had studiously avoided men for  these two days past now; but, so far from avoiding this man, he  rose on his hind-legs to give greeting, and could hardly be induced  to lower his front paws, even when the man in pyjamas had removed  his caressing arms from about the Wolfhound's shoulders. The man,  you see, was the Master, and three minutes afterwards he was joined  by the Mistress of the Kennels. But they were all three in the  Master's outside den then with Tara.          [Illustration]    CHAPTER IX    THE HEART OF TARA      The Mistress of the Kennels held on to one of Finn's fore-paws as  though she feared he might be spirited away from the den, even  while he was being welcomed home there. The fatted calf took the  form of a dish of new milk and some sardines on toast which had  been prepared for the next morning's breakfast. But this came  later, and was polished off by Finn more by reason of its rare  daintiness and his desire to live up to what the occasion seemed to  demand of him, than because he was hungry. At an early stage in  proceedings the Master noticed, and removed, the slip-collar.    \"Well, that disposes of the theory that Finn wandered away of his  own accord,\" said the Master. \"If the police know their business  this ought to help them.\" Then he turned to Finn again. \"You didn't  know there was a twenty-five pound reward out for you, my son, did  you? It was to have been made fifty in another day or two; though,  if you did but know it, our solvency demands rather that you should  be sold, than paid for in that fashion.\"    The Mistress nodded thoughtfully.    \"But that's quite impossible after this,\" she said; \"selling Finn,  I mean.\"    The Master smiled. \"I suppose it is. That seems to be rather our  way. It's a dead sure thing there can be no selling of Tara, and--I'm  inclined to think you're right about Finn, too. Heavens! If I  could lay my hands on the man who took that chip off his muzzle, I  think I'd run to the length of a ten pounds fine for assault. I'd  get my money's worth, too. The dog has been clubbed; he has been  man-handled; I could swear he has had to fight for his freedom.  Poor old Finn! What a dog! What a Finn it is!\"    While the last of these remarks was being made the Master was  carefully examining Finn all over, parting the Wolfhound's dense  hard hair over places in which the skin beneath had been broken,  and pressing his fingers along the lines of different bones and  muscles solicitously. There was a half-spoken oath on the Master's  lips when Finn winced from him as his hand passed down the ribs of  the hound's right side.    \"There is a rib broken here,\" he said to the Mistress, \"unless I am  much mistaken. When the post office opens in the morning we must  wire for Turle, the vet. Thieving's bad enough, but--there are some  stupid brutes in this world!\"    The Mistress stared.    \"Oh, no, I don't mean Finn; nor any of his honest four-legged kind.  I meant two-legged brutes. Finn has been handled more roughly than  an understanding man would handle a tiger. And look at his face.  Look into his eyes. Notice his keenly watchful air, even while I am  handling him. Well, Finn, my son, you have said good-bye to  puppyhood with a vengeance now. Unless I am much mistaken he has  crowded more into the last three days than all the rest of his life  till now had taught him. That dog's years older than Kathleen to-night  in some ways. Do you get the effect I mean? The youth has  gone; there is a certain new hardness. Watch his eye now as I lift  my hand!\"    The Master lifted his hand with a sudden jerk, and the two who were  watching Finn's eyes saw that in them which they had never seen in  Kathleen's, nor yet even in Tara's eyes; for neither Tara nor her  daughter had ever pitted their agility against man's brutality.  They had never been clubbed or kicked; they had never seen as far  into the ugly places of human nature as Finn; and you might  brandish your arms in any way you chose before old Tara or  Kathleen, and, while the one would have blinked at you with  courteous tolerance of your foolishness, the other would have  suspected you of inventing a new game, and gambolled before you  like a huge kitten.    It was not, of course, that Finn was foolish enough to distrust the  Master, or suspect him of any hostile intention. But certain  instincts had been awakened in the young Wolfhound, and, for a long  time, at all events, and probably for the rest of his life, those  instincts would not again become latent. In some respects he may  have been the better off; certainly he was better equipped to face  the world; but the Master, naturally enough, could not withhold a  sigh for the old utter trustfulness which had held even the  instincts of self-preservation in abeyance. But, as has been said,  Finn was better equipped to face the world than either his sister,  or that gentle great lady, his mother; all his instincts were more  alert, and his senses also. His eyes moved more rapidly than their  eyes; his attitude toward life and toward men-folk was more elastic  and less absolute. Men-folk remained his superiors in Finn's eyes,  his superiors in a hundred ways, and it might be his dearly loved  friends; but they were not any more the absolute, omnipotent, and  all-perfect gods that they had been, and still were to Kathleen,  for example, who would not have felt the slightest uneasiness if  the Master had placed his heel on her throat, or touched her head  with a club, as she lay on the ground before him.    To a great extent, however, the Master's sympathetic anger over  Finn's wounds, and twinges of regret regarding the subtle changes  which he recognised in the hound he affectionately called \"son,\"  were out-balanced by the joy he felt at seeing Finn safe in his den  again. The loss of Finn had been hard to bear, and not the less  hard because it came immediately after the great triumph of the  Show. There were the seven prize cards adorning the wall over  Tara's great bed in the den; but their presence had been something  of a mockery in the absence of their winner. When the Master and  the Mistress finally bade Finn good night, after making him  thoroughly comfortable in his own clean, big bed, the coach-house  door was carefully padlocked.    It could not have been said a month later that Finn was physically  the worse for his adventure in the hands of Matey. His ribs were  sound once more, and all his wounds and bruises were healed, though  a light-coloured scar remained, and would remain on his muzzle,  where the dog-stealer's stick had bitten into the bone. If it had  come nine months earlier, such an experience would have been bad  indeed, for sets-back in puppyhood are hard to make up. But at  fifteen months Finn had as perfect a physical foundation to go upon  as any living creature could have. He was fortified against  physical ills as few animals can be; his system lacked nothing that  makes for resisting power; he had attained his full growth without  having known a day's illness, and"]]]
