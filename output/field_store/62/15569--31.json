Murray was a zealous  Protestant, and had the support of Knox in all his measures, and the  countenance of the English ministry. Abating his intrigue and  ambition, he was a most estimable man, and deserved the affections of  the nation, which he retained until his death. M'Crie, in his Life of  Knox, represents him as a model of Christian virtue and integrity, and  every way worthy of the place he held in the affections of his party.    [Sidenote: Captivity of Queen Mary.]    The unfortunate queen suffered great unkindness in her lonely  confinement, and Knox, with the more zealous of his party, clamored  for her death, as an adulteress and a murderer. She succeeded in  escaping from her prison, raised an army, marched against the regent,  was defeated at the battle of Langside, fled to England, and became,  May, 1568, the prisoner-guest of her envious rival. Elizabeth obtained  the object of her desires. But the captivity of Mary, confined in  Tutbury Castle, against all the laws of hospitality and justice, gave  rise to incessant disturbances, both in England and Scotland, until  her execution, in 1587. And these form no inconsiderable part of the  history of England for seventeen years. Scotland was the scene of  anarchy, growing out of the contentions and jealousies of rival  chieftains, who stooped to every crime that appeared to facilitate  their objects. In 1570, the regent Murray was assassinated. He was  succeeded by his enemy, the Earl of Lennox, who, in his turn, was shot  by an assassin. The Earl of Mar succeeded him, but lived only a year.  Morton became regent, the reward of his many crimes but retribution at  last overtook him, being executed when James assumed the sovereignty.    [Sidenote: Execution of Mary.]    Meanwhile, the unfortunate Mary pined in hopeless captivity. It was  natural for her to seek release, and also for her friends to help her.  Among her friends was the Duke of Norfolk, the first nobleman in  England, and a zealous Catholic. He aspired to her hand; but Elizabeth  chose to consider his courtship as a treasonable act, and Norfolk was  arrested. On being afterwards released, he plotted for the liberation  of Mary, and his intrigues brought him to the block. The unfortunate  captive, wearied and impatient, naturally sought the assistance of  foreign powers. She had her agents in Rome, France, Spain, and the Low  Countries. The Catholics in England espoused her cause, and a  conspiracy was formed to deliver her, assassinate Elizabeth, and  restore the Catholic religion. From the fact that Mary was privy to  that part of it which concerned her own deliverance, she was brought  to trial as a criminal, found guilty by a court incompetent to sit on  her case, and executed without remorse, 8th February, 1587.    Few persons have excited more commiseration than this unfortunate  queen, both on account of her exalted rank, and her splendid  intellectual accomplishments. Whatever obloquy she merited for her  acts as queen of Scotland, no one can blame her for meditating escape  from the power of her zealous but more fortunate rival; and her  execution is the greatest blot in the character of the queen of  England, at this time in the zenith of her glory.    Next to the troubles with Scotland growing out of the interference of  Elizabeth, the great political events of the reign were the long and  protracted war with Spain, and the Irish rebellion. Both of these  events were important.    Spain was at this time governed by Philip II., son of the emperor  Charles, one of the most bigoted Catholics of the age, and allied with  Catharine de Medicis of France for the entire suppression of  Protestantism. She incited her son Charles IX. to the massacre of St.  Bartholomew, and Philip established the inquisition in Flanders. This  measure provoked an insurrection, to suppress which the Duke of Alva,  one of the most celebrated of the generals of Charles V., was sent  into the Netherlands with a large army, and almost unlimited powers.  The cruelties of Alva were unparalleled. In six years, eighteen  thousand persons perished by the hands of the executioner, and Alva  counted on the entire suppression of Protestantism by the mere force  of armies. He could count the physical resources of the people, but he  could not estimate the degree of their resistance when animated by the  spirit of liberty or religion. Providence, too, takes care of those  who strive to take care of themselves. A great leader appeared among  the suffering Hollanders, almost driven to despair--the celebrated  William of Nassau, Prince of Orange. He appeared as the champion of  the oppressed and insulted people; they rallied around his standard,  fought with desperate bravery, opened the dikes upon their cultivated  fields, expelled their invaders, and laid the foundation of their  liberties. But they could not have withstood the gigantic power of the  Spanish monarchy, then in the fulness of its strength, and the most  powerful in Europe, had it not been for aid rendered by Elizabeth. She  compassionated their sufferings, and had respect for their cause. She  entered into an alliance, defensive and offensive, and the Netherlands  became the great theatre of war, even after they had thrown off the  Spanish yoke. Although the United Provinces in the end obtained their  liberty, they suffered incredible hardships, and lost some of the  finest of their cities, Antwerp among the rest, long the rival of  Amsterdam, and the scene of Rubens's labors.    [Sidenote: Military Preparations of Philip II.]    The assistance which Elizabeth rendered to the Hollanders, of course,  provoked the resentment of Philip II., and this was increased by the  legalized piracies of Sir Francis Drake, in the West Indies, and on  the coasts of South America. This commander, in time of peace,  insisted on a right to visit those ports which the Spaniards had  closed, which, by the law of nations, is piracy. Philip, according to  all political maxims, was forced to declare war with England, and he  made immense preparations to subdue it. But the preparations of  Elizabeth to resist the powerful monarch were also great, and Drake  performed brilliant exploits on the sea, among other things,  destroying one hundred ships in the Bay of Cadiz, and taking immense  spoil. The preparations of the Spanish monarch were made on such a  gigantic scale, that Elizabeth summoned a great council of war to meet  the emergency, at which the all-accomplished Sir Walter Raleigh took a  leading part. His advice was to meet the Spaniards on the sea.  Although the royal navy consisted, at this time, of only thirty-six  sail, such vigorous measures were prosecuted, that one hundred and  ninety-one ships were collected, manned by seventeen thousand four  hundred seamen. The merchants of London granted thirty ships and ten  thousand men, and all England was aroused to meet the expected danger.  Never was patriotism more signally evinced, never were more decisive  proofs given of the popularity of a sovereign. Indeed, Elizabeth was  always popular with the nation; and with all her ceremony, and state,  and rudeness to the commons, and with all their apparent servility,  she never violated the laws, or irritated the people by oppressive  exactions. Many acts of the Tudor princes seem to indicate the reign  of despotism in England, but this despotism was never grievous, and  had all the benignity of a paternal government. Capricious and  arbitrary as Elizabeth was, in regard to some unfortunate individuals  who provoked her hatred or her jealousy, still she ever sedulously  guarded the interests of the nation, and listened to the counsel of  patriotic and able ministers. When England was threatened with a  Spanish invasion, there was not a corner of the land which did not  rise to protect a beloved sovereign; nor was there a single spot,  where a landing might be effected, around which an army of twenty  thousand could not be rallied in forty-eight hours.    [Sidenote: Spanish Armada.]    But Philip, nevertheless, expected the complete conquest of England;  and, as his \"Invincible Armada\" of one hundred and thirty ships, left  the mouth of the Tagus, commanded by Medina Sidonia, and manned by the  noblest troops of Spain, he fancied his hour of triumph was at hand.  But his hopes proved dreams, like most of the ambitious designs of  men. The armada met with nothing but misfortunes, both from battle and  from storms. Only fifty ships returned to Spain. An immense booty was  divided among the English sailors, and Elizabeth sent, in her turn, a  large fleet to Spain, the following year, (1589,) under the command of  Drake, which, after burning a few towns, returned ingloriously to  England, with a loss of ten thousand men. The war was continued with  various success till 1598, when a peace was negotiated. The same year,  died Philip II., and Lord Burleigh, who, for forty years, directed the  councils of Elizabeth, and to whose voice she ever listened, even when  opposed by such favorites as Leicester and Essex. Burleigh was not a  great genius, but was a man admirably adapted to his station and his  times,--was cool, sagacious, politic, and pacific, skilful in the  details of business competent to advise, but not aspiring to command.  He was splendidly rewarded for his services, and left behind him three  hundred distinct landed estates.    [Sidenote: Irish Rebellion.]    Meanwhile the attention of the queen was directed to the affairs of  Ireland, which had been conquered by Henry II. in the year 1170, but  over which only an imperfect sovereignty had been exercised. The Irish  princes and nobles, divided among themselves, paid the exterior marks  of obedience, but kept the country in a constant state of  insurrection.    The impolitic and romantic projects of the English princes for  subduing France,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24614"],[0,"The Science of Fairy Tales (#20)"],[1," having it christened.' The counsel was taken,  and I believe with success.\" The same belief is found both in North and  South Wales. It is also testified to by a Scottish clergyman, who  moreover adduces the following conversation as illustrative of it and of  \"an undefinable sort of awe about unbaptized infants, as well as an idea  of uncanniness in having them without baptism in the house,\" which is  entertained among the labouring classes in the north-east of Scotland.  \"Oh, sir,\" said the wife of a working man to the minister, on asking him  to baptize her child along with others, whose mothers were present,  \"this registration's the warst thing the queentry ever saw; it sud be  deen awa' wee athegeethir!\" \"Why?\" asked the minister, in astonishment  at the woman's words and earnestness of manner. \"It'll pit oot kirsnin  athegeethir. Ye see the craitirs gets their names, an we jist think that  aneuch, an' we're in nae hurry sennin for you.\" How far, as this  anecdote dimly suggests, it was the giving of a name which was supposed  to protect a child, I cannot say: more probably it was the dedication to  God involved in baptism. This is countenanced by the precaution said to  have been observed in Nithsdale when a pretty child was born to  consecrate it to God, and sue for its protection by \"taking the Beuk\"  and other acts of prayer and devotion.[61]    Putting aside such ceremonies as these which may be supposed distinctly  Christian, there were other charms looked upon as efficacious. Thus in  Scotland it was deemed highly judicious to keep an open Bible always  near a child, and even to place the holy volume beneath the head of a  woman in labour. In some parts of Germany it is enough to lay a single  leaf out of a Bible or prayer-book in the cradle, until by the baptism  of the infant the danger of robbery passes away; and a prayer-book is  also placed under the pillow of the newly-made mother, who is at that  time specially liable to fall under the power of the underground folk.  Indeed a prayer-book, or the mere repetition of a Paternoster, is  equally valuable with a Bible for these purposes; and if, by the neglect  of any of these precautions, an opportunity be given to the foe, the  child may yet be saved by the utterance of the name of Jesus Christ at  the moment when the change is being effected. Holy water and the sign of  the cross, in Ireland, or a rosary blessed by a priest, in Picardy,  enjoy a similar reputation.[62]    All these means of prevention are veneered with some sort of  Christianity; but there are others which display Heathenism naked and  unblushing. While a child in Mecklenburg remains unbaptized it is  necessary to burn a light in the chamber. Nor is the superstition  confined to one district: it is common all over Germany and Denmark; it  was once common in England; it is found in Ireland; it is found among  the Lithuanians on the shores of the Baltic; it was practised by the  ancient Romans, and appears to be a relic of the sacred character  anciently imputed to fire. In the island of Lewis fire used to be  carried round women before they were churched and children before they  were christened, both night and morning; and this was held effectual to  preserve both mother and infant from evil spirits, and (in the case of  the infant) from being changed. The Sad Dar, one of the sacred books of  the Parsees, contains directions to keep a continual fire in the house  during a woman's pregnancy, and after the child is born to burn a lamp  for three nights and days--a fire, indeed, is declared to be better--\"so  that the demons and fiends may not be able to do any damage and harm.\"  By way of enforcing this precept we are told that when Zoroaster was  born, a demon came at the head of a hundred and fifty other demons,  every night for three nights, to slay him, but they were put to flight  by seeing the fire, and were consequently unable to hurt him.[63]    Iron or steel, in the shape of needles, a key, a knife, a pair of tongs,  an open pair of scissors, or in any other shape, if placed in the  cradle, secured the desired end. In Bulgaria a reaping-hook is placed in  a corner of the room for the same purpose. I shall not stay now to  discuss the reason why supernatural beings dread and dislike iron. The  open pair of scissors, however, it should be observed, has double power;  for it is not only of the abhorred metal,--it is also in form a cross.  The use of the cross in baptism was probably one of the reasons for the  efficacy of that rite against felonious fairies. At all events, over a  very wide area the cross is thought a potent protection; nor is the  belief by any means confined to Christian lands. Mr. Mitchell-Innes  tells us that the fear of changelings exists in China. \"To avert the  calamity of nursing a demon, dried banana-skin is burnt to ashes, which  are then mixed with water. Into this the mother dips her finger and  paints a cross upon the sleeping babe's forehead. In a short time the  demon soul returns--for the soul wanders from the body during sleep and  is free--but, failing to recognize the body thus disguised, flies off.  The true soul, which has been waiting for an opportunity, now approaches  the dormant body, and, if the mark has been washed off in time, takes  possession of it; but if not, it, like the demon, failing to recognize  the body, departs, and the child dies in its sleep.\"[64] How to hit the  exact moment between the flight of the demon and the advent of the true  soul doubtless puzzles many a Chinese mother fully as much as the cross  puzzles the two competing souls. But when she is successful she baffles  the evil spirit by deceit, of which the cross is made the instrument;  though we may well believe that the child is not disguised in this way  without reference to the cross's inherent sanctity; for it is a  religious symbol among nations who never heard the gospel of the  Crucified.    Spirits whose baleful influences are feared by man are happily easily  tricked. To this guilelessness on their part must be attributed another  strange method of defeating their evil designs on children. It appears  to be enough to lay over the infant, or on the bed beside the mother, a  portion of the father's clothes. A shepherd's wife living near Selkirk  was lying in bed one day with her new-born boy at her side, when she  heard a sound of talking and laughter in the room. Suspecting what  turned out to be the case, she seized in great alarm her husband's  waistcoat, which was lying at the foot of the bed, and flung it over  herself and the child. The fairies, for it was they who were the cause  of the noise, set up a loud scream, crying out: \"Auld Luckie has cheated  us o' our bairnie!\" Soon afterwards the woman heard something fall down  the chimney, and looking out she saw a waxen effigy of her baby, stuck  full of pins, lying on the hearth. The would-be thieves had meant to  substitute this for the child. When her husband came home he made up a  large fire and threw the doll upon it; but, instead of burning, the  thing flew up the chimney amid shouts of laughter from the unseen  visitors. The suggestion seems to be that the sight of the father's  clothes leads \"the good people\" to think that he himself is present  watching over his offspring. Some articles of clothing, however, seem to  have special virtue, such as a right shirt-sleeve or a left stocking,  though wherefore is not very clear; and in China, about Canton, a  fisherman's net is employed with as little apparent reason. In Sweden  the babe is wrapped in red cloth, which we may be allowed to conjecture  is intended to cozen the fairies by simulating fire.[65]    Moreover, certain plants are credited with a similar gift. In Germany  orant (whatever that may be), blue marjoram, and black cumin; and in  Denmark garlic--nasty enough surely to keep any beings off--and bread  are used. The Danes, too, place salt in the cradle or over the door. The  Italians fear not only fairies who rob them of their children, but also  witches who tear the faces of unbaptized infants. These are both old  superstitions, dating in one form or other from classic times. To baulk  the witches of their prey it is in some places customary to keep a light  burning in the chamber at night, and to affix at the door of the house  the image of a saint, hanging to it a rosary and an unravelled napkin;  while behind the door are put a jar full of salt and a brush. A twofold  defence is thus built up; for the witch, beholding the image of the  saint and the rosary, will straightway retire; or if these fail to warn  her off, she will on entering be compelled to count the grains of salt,  the broken threads of the napkin, and the twigs of the brush--a task  that will keep her occupied from midnight, when at the earliest she can  dare appear, until dawn, when she must slink away without having been  able to attain her object. Among the Greeks witches are believed to have  great power. They seek new-born babes to suck their blood or to prick  them to death with sharp instruments. Often they inflict such injuries  that a child remains for ever a cripple or an invalid. The Nereids of  the fountains and springs are also on the watch \"to exchange one of  their own fractious offspring for a mortal babe.\" Constant watchfulness,  and baptism as soon as the Church permits it, are therefore necessary.  In England it seems to have been held in former days that witches stole  children from their cradles before baptism to make an oil or unguent by  boiling them to a jelly. A part of this jelly they used to drink, and  with the remainder they rubbed their bodies. This was the orthodox means  of acquiring magical powers. It is a Sicilian belief that the hands of  unbaptized children are used by witches in their sorceries.[66]    As we might expect, the reason why unbaptized babes are held to be so  liable to these attacks is that until"]]]
