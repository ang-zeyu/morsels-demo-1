(#20)"],[1,"through the cave in every direction, and the whole formed a  wild, picturesque, and romantic scene.    At this village we found waiting for us the major domo of the hacienda  of San Joaquin, on which stand the ruins of Mayapan. Leaving the  senote, we mounted and followed him.    At the distance of half a mile he stopped near a great cave that had  lately been discovered, and which, he said had no end. Tying our horses  to the bushes, we turned off to visit it. The major domo cut a path a  short distance into the woods; following which we came to a large  hollow, overgrown with trees, and, descending, entered a great cavern  with a lofty roof, and gigantic passages branching off in different  directions, and running no one knew whither. The cave had been  discovered by the major domo and some vaqueros while in pursuit of  robbers who had stolen a bull; and no robber's cave in romantic story  could equal it in wildness. The major domo said he had entered it with  ten men, and had passed four hours in exploration without finding any  end. The cave, its roof, base, and passages, were an immense fossil  formation. Marine shells were conglomerated together in solid masses,  many of them perfect, showing a geological structure which indicated  that the whole country, or, at least, that portion of it; had been  once, and probably at no very remote period, overflowed by the sea.    We could have passed a day with much satisfaction in rambling through  this cave, but, remaining only a few minutes, and taking away some  curious and interesting specimens, we remounted, and very soon reached  mounds of earth, fragments of sculptured stones, broken walls, and  fallen buildings, indicating that we were once more treading upon the  sepulchre of an aboriginal city.    At eleven o'clock we came to a clearing, in which was situated the  hacienda of San Joaquin. The building was a mere rancho, erected only  for the residence of a mayoral, a person inferior to a major domo; but  there was a fine clearing around it, and the situation was wild and  beautiful. In the cattleyard were noble trees. In the platform of the  well were sculptured stones taken from the ancient buildings; it was  shaded by the spreading branches of a fine ramon or tropical oak, with  a foliage of vivid green; and crowning the top, and apparently growing  out of it, were the long, pale leaves of the cocoanut.    The hacienda, or rather rancho, of San Joaquin, on which the ruins of  Mayapan lie scattered, is ten leagues south from Merida. It forms part  of the great hacienda of Xcanchakan, the property of Don Jose Maria  Meneses, the venerable cura of San Cristoval, formerly provesor of the  Church of Yucatan. We had made the acquaintance of this gentleman at  the house of his friend Senor Rejon, secretary of state, and he had  sent instructions to his major domo, the same who had met us at the  last village, to place at our command all the disposable force of the  hacienda.    The ruins of Mayapan cover a great plain, which was at that time so  overgrown that hardly any object was visible until we were close upon  it, and the undergrowth was so thick that it was difficult to work our  way through it. Our's was the first visit to examine these ruins. For  ages they had been unnoticed, almost unknown, and left to struggle with  rank tropical vegetation; and the major domo, who lived on the  principal hacienda, and had not seen them in twenty-three years, was  more familiar with them than any other person we could find. He told us  that within a circumference of three miles, ruins were found, and that  a strong wall once encompassed the city, the remains of which might  still be traced through the woods.    [Engraving 2. A ruined Mound.]    At a short distance from the hacienda, but invisible on account of the  trees, rises the high mound which we had seen at three leagues'  distance, from the top of the church at Tekoh, and which is represented  in the following engraving. It is sixty feet high, and one hundred feet  square at the base; and, like the mounds at Palenque and Uxmal, it is  an artificial structure, built up solid from the plain. Though seen  from a great distance above the tops of the trees, the whole field was  so overgrown that it was scarcely visible until we reached its foot;  and the mound itself, though retaining the symmetry of its original  proportions, was also so overgrown that it appeared a mere wooded hill,  but peculiar in its regularity of shape. Four grand staircases, each  twenty-five feet wide, ascended to an esplanade within six feet of the  top. This esplanade was six feet in width, and on each side was a  smaller staircase leading to the top. These staircases are in a ruinous  condition; the steps are almost entirely gone, and we climbed up by  means of fallen stones and trees growing out of its sides. As we  ascended, we scared away a cow, for the wild cattle roaming on these  wooded wastes pasture on its sides, and ascend to the top.    The summit was a plain stone platform, fifteen feet square. It had no  structure upon it, nor were there vestiges of any. Probably it was the  great mound of sacrifice, on which the priests, in the sight of the  assembled people, cut out the hearts of human victims. The view  commanded from the top was a great desolate plain, with here and there  another ruined mound rising above the trees, and far in the distance  could be discerned the towers of the church at Tekoh.    Around the base of this mound, and throughout the woods, wherever we  moved, were strewed sculptured stones. Most of them were square, carved  on the face, and having a long stone tenon or stem at the back;  doubtless they had been fixed in the wall, so as to form part of some  ornament, or combination of ornaments, in the facade, in all respects  the same as at Uxmal.    [Engraving 3: Sculptured Figures]    Besides these, there were other and more curious remains. These were  representations of human figures, or of animals, with hideous features  and expressions, in producing which the skill of the artist seems to  have been expended. The sculpture of these figures was rude, the stones  were timeworn, and many were half buried in the earth. The following  engraving represents two of them. One is four, and the other three feet  high. The full length seems intended to represent a warrior with a  shield. The arms are broken off, and to my mind they conveyed a lively  idea of the figures or idols which Bernal Dias met with on the coast,  containing hideous faces of demons. Probably, broken and half buried as  they lie, they were once objects of adoration and worship, and now  exist as mute and melancholy memorials of ancient paganism.    At a short distance from the base of the mound was an opening in the  earth, forming another of those extraordinary caves before presented to  the reader. The cura, the major domo, and the Indians called it a  senote, and said that it had supplied the inhabitants of the old city  with water. The entrance was by a broken, yawning mouth, steep, and  requiring some care in the descent. At the first resting-place, the  month opened into an extensive subterraneous chamber, with a high roof,  and passages branching off in every direction. In different places were  remains of fires and the bones of animals, showing that it had at times  been the place of refuge or residence of men. In the entrance of one of  the passages we found a sculptured idol, which excited us with the hope  of discovering some altar or sepulchre, or perhaps mummied figures.  With this hope, we sent the Indians to procure torches; and while Mr.  Catherwood was making some sketches, Doctor Cabot and myself passed an  hour in exploring the recesses of the cave. In many places the roof had  fallen, and the passages were choked up. We followed several of them  with much toil and disappointment, and at length fell into one, low and  narrow, along which it was necessary to crawl on the hands and feet,  and where, from the flame and smoke of the torches, it was desperately  hot. We at length came to a body of water, which, on thrusting the hand  into it, we found to be incrusted with a thin coat of sulphate of lime,  that had formed on the top of the water, but decomposed on being  brought into the air.    Leaving the cave or senote, we continued rambling among the ruins. The  mounds were all of the same general character, and the buildings had  entirely disappeared on all except one; but this was different from any  we had at that time seen, though we afterward found others like it.    [Engraving 4: Circular Edifice]    It stood on a ruined mound about thirty feet high. What the shape of  the mound had been it was difficult to make out, but the building was  circular. The following engraving represents this edifice, with the  mound on which it stands. The exterior is of plain stone, ten feet high  to the top of the lower cornice, and fourteen more to that of the upper  one. The door faces the west, and over it is a lintel of stone. The  outer wall is five feet thick; the door opens into a circular passage  three feet wide, and in the centre is a cylindrical solid mass of  stone, without any doorway or opening of any kind. The whole diameter  of the building is twenty-five feet, so that, deducting the double  width of the wall and passage, this centre mass must be nine feet in  thickness. The walls had four or five coats of stucco, and there were  remains of painting, in which red, yellow, blue, and white were  distinctly visible.    On the southwest side of the building, and on a terrace projecting from  the side of the mound, was a double row of columns eight feet apart, of  which only eight remained, though probably, from the fragments around,  there had been more, and, by clearing away the trees, more might have  been found still standing. In our hurried visit to Uxmal, we had seen  objects which we supposed might have"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3317"],[0,"Now It Can Be Told (#20)"],[1,"up with sandbags and deep mine-craters filled with  stinking water slopping over from the Bellewarde Lake and low-lying  pools. Bodies, and bits of bodies, and clots of blood, and green  metallic-looking slime, made by explosive gases, were floating on the  surface of that water below the crater banks when I first passed that  way, and so it was always. Our men lived there and died there within a  few yards of the enemy, crouched below the sand-bags and burrowed in  the sides of the crater. Lice crawled over them in legions. Human flesh,  rotting and stinking, mere pulp, was pasted into the mud-banks. If they  dug to get deeper cover their shovels went into the softness of dead  bodies who had been their comrades. Scraps of flesh, booted legs,  blackened hands, eyeless heads, came falling over them when the enemy  trench-mortared their position or blew up a new mine-shaft.    I remember one young Irish officer who came down to bur quarters on a  brief respite from commanding the garrison at Hooge. He was a handsome  fellow, like young Philip of Spain by Velasquez, and he had a profound  melancholy in his eyes in spite of a charming smile.    \"Do you mind if I have a bath before I join you?\" he asked.    He walked about in the open air until the bath was ready. Even there a  strong, fetid smell came from him.    \"Hooge,\" he said, in a thoughtful way, \"is not a health resort.\"    He was more cheerful after his bath and did not feel quite such a leper.  He told one or two stories about the things that happened at Hooge,  and I wondered if hell could be so bad. After a short stay he went back  again, and I could see that he expected to be killed. Before saying  good-by he touched some flowers on the mess-table, and for a moment or  two listened to birds twittering in the trees.    \"Thanks very much,\" he said. \"I've enjoyed this visit a good deal.. .  Good-by.\"    He went back through Ypres on the way to Hooge, and the mine-crater  where his Irish soldiers were lying in slime, in which vermin crawled.    Sometimes it was the enemy who mined under our position, blowing a few  men to bits and scattering the sand-bags. Sometimes it was our men  who upheaved the earth beyond them by mine charges and rushed the new  crater.    It was in July of '15 that the devils of Hooge became merry and bright  with increased activity. The Germans had taken possession of one of the  mine-craters which formed the apex of a triangle across the Menin road,  with trenches running down to it on either side, so that it was like the  spear-head of their position. They had fortified it with sand-bags and  crammed it with machine--guns which could sweep the ground on three  sides, so making a direct attack by infantry a suicidal enterprise. Our  trenches immediately faced this stronghold from the other side of a  road at right angles with the Menin road, and our men--the New Army  boys--were shelled day and night, so that many of them were torn to  pieces, and others buried alive, and others sent mad by shell-shock.  (They were learning their lessons in the school of courage.) It was  decided by a conference of generals, not at Hooge, to clear out this  hornets' nest, and the job was given to the sappers, who mined under  the roadway toward the redoubt, while our heavy artillery shelled the  enemy's position all around the neighborhood.    On July 22d the mine was exploded, while our men crouched low, horribly  afraid after hours of suspense. The earth was rent asunder by a gust of  flame, and vomited up a tumult of soil and stones and human limbs and  bodies. Our men still crouched while these things fell upon them.    \"I thought I had been blown to bits,\" one of them told me. \"I was a  quaking fear, with my head in the earth. I kept saying, 'Christ!...  Christ!'\"    When the earth and smoke had settled again it was seen that the enemy's  redoubt had ceased to exist. In its place, where there had been a  crisscross of trenches and sand-bag shelters for their machine-guns and  a network of barbed wire, there was now an enormous crater, hollowed  deep with shelving sides surrounded by tumbled earth heaps which had  blocked up the enemy's trenches on either side of the position, so that  they could not rush into the cavern and take possession. It was our men  who \"rushed\" the crater and lay there panting in its smoking soil.    Our generals had asked for trouble when they destroyed that redoubt,  and our men had it. Infuriated by a massacre of their garrison in the  mine-explosion and by the loss of their spear-head, the Germans kept up  a furious bombardment on our trenches in that neighborhood in bursts of  gun-fire which tossed our earthworks about and killed and wounded many  men. Our line at Hooge at that time was held by the King's Royal  Rifles of the 14th Division, young fellows, not far advanced in  the training-school of war. They held on under the gunning of their  positions, and each man among them wondered whether it was the shell  screeching overhead or the next which would smash him into pulp like  those bodies lying nearby in dugouts and upheaved earthworks.    On the morning of July 30th there was a strange lull of silence after a  heavy bout of shells and mortars. Men of the K. R. R. raised their heads  above broken parapets and crawled out of shell-holes and looked about.  There were many dead bodies lying around, and wounded men were wailing.  The unwounded, startled by the silence, became aware of some moisture  falling on them; thick, oily drops of liquid.    \"What in hell's name--?\" said a subaltern.    One man smelled his clothes, which reeked of something like paraffin.    Coming across from the German trenches were men hunched up under some  heavy weights. They were carrying cylinders with nozles like hose-pipes.  Suddenly there was a rushing noise like an escape of air from some  blast-furnace. Long tongues of flame licked across to the broken ground  where the King's Royal Rifles lay.    Some of them were set on fire, their clothes burning on them, making  them living torches, and in a second or two cinders.    It was a new horror of war--the Flammenwerfer.    Some of the men leaped to their feet, cursing, and fired repeatedly at  the Germans carrying the flaming jets. Here and there the shots were  true. A man hunched under a cylinder exploded like a fat moth caught  in a candle-flame. But that advancing line of fire after the long  bombardment was too much for the rank and file, whose clothes were  smoking and whose bodies were scorched. In something like a panic they  fell back, abandoning the cratered ground in which their dead lay.    The news of this disaster and of the new horror reached the troops in  reserve, who had been resting in the rear after a long spell. They moved  up at once to support their comrades and make a counter-attack. The  ground they had to cover was swept by machine-guns, and many fell, but  the others attacked again and again, regardless of their losses, and won  back part of the lost ground, leaving only a depth of five hundred yards  in the enemy's hands.    So the position remained until the morning of August 9th, when a new  attack was begun by the Durham, Yorkshire, Lancashire, and Midland  troops of the 6th Division, who had been long in the salient and had  proved the quality of northern \"grit\" in the foul places and the foul  weather of that region.    It was late on the night of August 8th that these battalions took up  their position, ready for the assault. These men, who came mostly from  mines and workshops, were hard and steady and did not show any outward  sign of nervousness, though they knew well enough that before the light  of another day came their numbers would have passed through the lottery  of this game of death. Each man's life depended on no more than a fluke  of luck by the throw of those dice which explode as they fall. They knew  what their job was. It was to cross five hundred yards of open ground  to capture and to hold a certain part of the German position near the  Chateau of Hooge.    They were at the apex of the triangle which made a German salient after  the ground was lost, on July 30th. On the left side of the triangle was  Zouave Wood, and Sanctuary Wood ran up the right side to a strong fort  held by the enemy and crammed with machine-guns and every kind of bomb.  The base of the upturned triangle was made by the Menin road, to the  north, beyond which lay the crater, the chateau, and the stables.    The way that lay between the regiment and their goal was not an easy one  to pass. It was cut and crosscut by our old trenches, now held by the  enemy, who had made tangles of barbed wire in front of their parapets,  and had placed machine-guns at various points. The ground was littered  with dead bodies belonging to the battle of July 30th, and pock-marked  by deep shell-holes. To cross five hundred yards of such ground in  the storm of the enemy's fire would be an ordeal greater than that of  rushing from one trench to another. It would have to be done in regular  attack formation, and with the best of luck would be a grim and costly  progress.    The night was pitch dark. The men drawn up could only see one another  as shadows blacker than the night. They were very quiet; each man was  fighting down his fear in his soul, trying to get a grip on nerves  hideously strained by the rack of this suspense. The words, \"Steady,  lads.\" were spoken down the ranks by young lieutenants and sergeants.  The sounds of men whispering, a cough here and there, a word of command,  the clink of bayonets, the cracking of twigs under heavy boots, the  shuffle of troops getting into line, would not carry with any loudness  to German ears.    The men deployed before dawn broke, waiting for the preliminary  bombardment which would smash a way for them. The officers struck  matches now and then to glance at their wrist-watches, set very  carefully to those of"]]]
