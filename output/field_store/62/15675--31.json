He knows a false nut from a good one without biting into  it. Try the experiment upon your tame chipmunk or caged gray squirrel,  and see if this is not so. The false or dead nut is lighter, and most  persons think this fact guides the squirrel. But this, it seems to me,  implies an association of ideas beyond the reach of instinct. A young  squirrel will reject a worthless nut as promptly as an old one will.  Again the sense of smell is the guide; the sound-meated nut has an  odor which the other has not. All animals are keen and wise in  relation to their food and to their natural enemies. A red squirrel  will chip up green apples and pears for the seeds at the core: can he  know, on general principles, that these fruits contain seeds? Does not  some clue to them reach his senses?    I have known gray squirrels to go many hundred yards in winter across  fields to a barn that contained grain in the sheaf. They could have  had no other guide to the grain than the sense of smell. Watch a  chipmunk or any squirrel near at hand: as a friend of mine observed,  he seems to be smelling with his whole body; his abdomen fairly  palpitates with the effort.    The coon knows when the corn is in the milk, gaining that knowledge,  no doubt, through his nose. At times he seems to know enough, too, to  cut off his foot when caught in a trap, especially if the foot becomes  frozen; but if you tell me he will treat his wound by smearing it with  pitch or anything else, or in any way except by licking it, I shall  discredit you. The practice of the art of healing by the application  of external or foreign substances is a conception entirely beyond the  capacity of any of the lower animals. If such a practice had been  necessary for the continuance of the species, it would probably have  been used. The knowledge it implies could not be inherited; it must  needs come by experience. When a fowl eats gravel or sand, is it  probable that the fowl knows what the practice is for, or has any  notion at all about the matter? It has a craving for the gravel, that  is all. Nature is wise for it.    The ostrich is described by those who know it intimately as the most  stupid and witless of birds, and yet before leaving its eggs exposed  to the hot African sun, the parent bird knows enough to put a large  pinch of sand on the top of each of them, in order, it is said, to  shade and protect the germ, which always rises to the highest point of  the egg. This act certainly cannot be the result of knowledge, as we  use the term; the young ostrich does it as well as the old. It is the  inherited wisdom of the race, or instinct.    A sitting bird or fowl turns its eggs at regular intervals, which has  the effect of keeping the yolk from sticking to the shell. Is this act  the result of knowledge or of experience? It is again the result of  that untaught knowledge called instinct. Some kinds of eggs hatch in  two weeks, some in three, others in four. The mother bird has no  knowledge of this period. It is not important that she should have. If  the eggs are addled or sterile, she will often continue to sit beyond  the normal period. If the continuance of the species depended upon her  knowing the exact time required to hatch her eggs, as it depends upon  her having the incubating fever, of course she would know exactly, and  would never sit beyond the required period.    But what shall we say of Mrs. Annie Martin's story, in her \"Home Life  on an Ostrich Farm,\" of the white-necked African crow that, in order  to feast upon the eggs of the ostrich, carries a stone high in the air  above them and breaks them by letting it fall? This looks like reason,  a knowledge of the relation of cause and effect. Mrs. Martin says the  crows break tortoise-shells in the same way, and have I not heard of  our own crows and gulls carrying clams and crabs into the air and  dropping them upon the rocks?    If Mrs. Martin's statements are literally true,--if she has not the  failing, so common among women observers, of letting her feeling and  her fancies color her observations,--then her story shows how the  pressure of hunger will develop the wit of a crow.    But the story goes one step beyond my credence. It virtually makes the  crow a tool-using animal, and Darwin knew of but two animals, the  man-like ape and the elephant, that used anything like a tool or  weapon to attain their ends. How could the crow gain the knowledge or  the experience which this trick implies? What could induce it to make  the first experiment of breaking an egg with a falling stone but an  acquaintance with physical laws such as man alone possesses? The first  step in this chain of causation it is easy to conceive of any animal  taking; namely, the direct application of its own powers or weapons to  the breaking of the shell. But the second step,--the making use of a  foreign substance or object in the way described,--that is what  staggers one.    Our own crow has great cunning, but it is only cunning. He is  suspicious of everything that looks like design, that suggests a trap,  even a harmless string stretched around a corn-field. As a natural  philosopher he makes a poor show, and the egg or the shell that he  cannot open with his own beak he leaves behind. Yet even his alleged  method of dropping clams upon the rocks to break the shells does not  seem incredible. He might easily drop a clam by accident, and then,  finding the shell broken, repeat the experiment. He is still only  taking the first step in the sequence of causations.    A recent English nature-writer, on the whole, I think, a good observer  and truthful reporter, Mr. Richard Kearton, tells of an osprey that  did this incredible thing: to prevent its eggs from being harmed by an  enforced exposure to the sun, the bird plunged into the lake, then  rose, and shook its dripping plumage over the nest. The writer  apparently reports this story at second-hand. It is incredible to me,  because it implies a knowledge that the hawk could not possibly  possess.    Such an emergency could hardly arise once in a lifetime to it or its  forbears. Hence the act could not have been the result of inherited  habit, or instinct, and as an original act on the part of the osprey  it is not credible. The bird probably plunged into the lake for a  fish, and then by accident shook itself above the eggs. In any case,  the amount of water that would fall upon the eggs under such  circumstances would be too slight to temper appreciably the heat.    There is little doubt that among certain of our common birds the male,  during periods of excessive heat, has been known to shade the female  with his outstretched wings, and the mother bird to shade her young in  the same way. But this is a different matter. This emergency must  have occurred for ages, and it, again, called only for the first step  from cause to effect, and called for the use of no intermediate agent.  If the robin were to hold a leaf or a branch above his mate at such  times, that would imply reflection.    It is said that elephants in India will besmear themselves with mud as  a protection against insects, and that they will break branches from  the trees and use them to brush away the flies. If this is true, it  shows, I think, something beyond instinct in the elephant; it shows  reflection.    All birds are secretive about their nests, and display great cunning  in hiding them; but whether they know the value of adaptive material,  such as moss, lichens, and dried grass, in helping to conceal them,  admits of doubt, because they so often use the results of our own  arts, as paper, rags, strings, tinsel, in such a reckless way. In a  perfectly wild state they use natural material because it is the  handiest and there is really no other. The phoebe uses the moss on  or near the rocks where she builds; the sparrows, the bobolinks, and  the meadowlarks use the dry grass of the bank or of the meadow bottom  where the nest is placed.    The English writer to whom I have referred says that the wren builds  the outside of its nest of old hay straws when placing it in the side  of a rick, of green moss when it is situated in a mossy bank, and of  dead leaves when in a hedge-row or a bramble-bush, in each case thus  rendering the nest very difficult of detection because it harmonizes  so perfectly with its surroundings, and the writer wonders if this  harmony is the result of accident or of design. He is inclined to  think that it is unpremeditated, as I myself do. The bird uses the  material nearest to hand.    Another case, which this same writer gives at second-hand, of a bird  recognizing the value of protective coloration, is not credible. A  friend of his told him that he had once visited a colony of terns \"on  an island where the natural breeding accommodation was so limited that  many of them had conveyed patches of pebbles on to the grass and laid  their eggs thereon.\"    Here is the same difficulty we have encountered before--one more step  of reasoning than the bird is capable of. As a deduction from observed  facts, a bird, of course, knows nothing about protective coloring; its  wisdom in this respect is the wisdom of Nature, and Nature in animal  life never acts with this kind of foresight. A bird may exercise some  choice about the background of its nest, but it will not make both  nest and background.    Nature learns by endless experiment. Through a long and expensive  process of natural selection she seems to have brought the color of  certain animals and the color of their environment pretty close  together, the better to hide the animals from their enemies and from  their prey, as we are told; but the animals themselves do not know  this, though they may act as if they did.

In appearance he was slightly  built, rather below the medium height, smooth shaven, and with deep-set  gray eyes. These eyes apparently, as they gave him his nickname, were  his most marked feature.    His followers called him, and later, when he was thirty-two years  old, he was known all over the United States as the \"Gray-Eyed Man of  Destiny.\"    From the first Walker recognized that in order to establish himself in  Nicaragua he must keep in touch with all possible recruits arriving from  San Francisco and New York, and that to do this he must hold the line  of transit from the Caribbean Sea to the Pacific. At this time the sea  routes to the gold-fields were three: by sailing vessel around the Cape,  one over the Isthmus of Panama, and one, which was the shortest, across  Nicaragua. By a charter from the Government of Nicaragua, the right to  transport passengers across this isthmus was controlled by the Accessory  Transit Company, of which the first Cornelius Vanderbilt was president.  His company owned a line of ocean steamers both on the Pacific side  and on the Atlantic side. Passengers _en route_ from New York to the  gold-fields were landed by these latter steamers at Greytown on the west  coast of Nicaragua, and sent by boats of light draught up the San Juan  River to Lake Nicaragua. There they were met by larger lake steamers and  conveyed across the lake to Virgin Bay. From that point, in carriages  and on mule back, they were carried twelve miles overland to the port of  San Juan del Sud on the Pacific Coast, where they boarded the company's  steamers to San Francisco.    During the year of Walker's occupation the number of passengers crossing  Nicaragua was an average of about two thousand a month.    It was to control this route that immediately after his first defeat  Walker returned to San Juan del Sud, and in a smart skirmish defeated  the enemy and secured possession of Virgin Bay, the halting place for  the passengers going east or west. In this fight Walker was outnumbered  five to one, but his losses were only three natives killed and a few  Americans wounded. The Legitimists lost sixty killed and a hundred  wounded. This proportion of losses shows how fatally effective was the  rifle and revolver fire of the Californians. Indeed, so wonderful was it  that when some years ago I visited the towns and cities captured by the  filibusters, I found that the marksmanship of Walker's Phalanx was still  a tradition. Indeed, thanks to the filibusters, to-day in any part of  Central America a man from the States, if in trouble, has only to show  his gun. No native will wait for him to fire it.    After the fight at Virgin Bay, Walker received from California fifty  recruits--a very welcome addition to his force, and as he now commanded  about one hundred and twenty Americans, three hundred Nicaraguans, under  a friendly native, General Valle, and two brass cannon, he decided to  again attack Rivas. Rivas is on the lake just above Virgin Bay; still  further up is Granada, which was the head-quarters of the Legitimists.    Fearing Walker's attack upon Rivas, the Legitimist troops were hurried  south from Granada to that city, leaving Granada but slightly protected.    Through intercepted letters Walker learned of this and determined to  strike at Granada. By night, in one of the lake steamers, he skirted the  shore, and just before daybreak, with fires banked and all lights out,  drew up to a point near the city. The day previous the Legitimists had  gained a victory, and, as good luck or Walker's \"destiny\" would have  it, the night before Granada had been celebrating the event. Much joyous  dancing and much drinking of aguardiente had buried the inhabitants in a  drugged slumber. The garrison slept, the sentries slept, the city slept.  But when the convent bells called for early mass, the air was shaken  with sharp reports that to the ears of the Legitimists were unfamiliar  and disquieting. They were not the loud explosions of their own muskets  nor of the smooth bores of the Democrats. The sounds were sharp and  cruel like the crack of a whip. The sentries flying from their posts  disclosed the terrifying truth. \"The Filibusteros!\" they cried.  Following them at a gallop came Walker and Valle and behind them the men  of the awful Phalanx, whom already the natives had learned to fear: the  bearded giants in red flannel shirts who at Rivas on foot had charged  the artillery with revolvers, who at Virgin Bay when wounded had drawn  from their boots glittering bowie knives and hurled them like arrows,  who at all times shot with the accuracy of the hawk falling upon a  squawking hen.    There was a brief terrified stand in the Plaza, and then a complete  rout. As was their custom, the native Democrats began at once to loot  the city. But Walker put his sword into the first one of these he met,  and ordered the Americans to arrest all others found stealing, and to  return the goods already stolen. Over a hundred political prisoners in  the cartel were released by Walker, and the ball and chain to which each  was fastened stricken off. More than two-thirds of them at once enlisted  under Walker's banner.    He now was in a position to dictate to the enemy his own terms of peace,  but a fatal blunder on the part of Parker H. French, a lieutenant of  Walker's, postponed peace for several weeks, and led to unfortunate  reprisals. French had made an unauthorized and unsuccessful assault  on San Carlos at the eastern end of the lake, and the Legitimists  retaliated at Virgin Bay by killing half a dozen peaceful passengers,  and at San Carlos by firing at a transit steamer. For this the excuse of  the Legitimists was, that now that Walker was using the lake steamers  as transports it was impossible for them to know whether the boats were  occupied by his men or neutral passengers. As he could not reach the  guilty ones, Walker held responsible for their acts their secretary  of state, who at the taking of Granada was among the prisoners. He was  tried by court-martial and shot, \"a victim of the new interpretation of  the principles of constitutional government.\" While this act of Walker's  was certainly stretching the theory of responsibility to the breaking  point, its immediate effect was to bring about a hasty surrender and a  meeting between the generals of the two political parties. Thus, four  months after Walker and his fifty-seven followers landed in Nicaragua,  a suspension of hostilities was arranged, and the side for which the  Americans had fought was in power. Walker was made commander-in-chief  of an army of twelve hundred men with salary of six thousand dollars a  year. A man named Rivas was appointed temporary president.    To Walker this pause in the fight was most welcome. It gave him an  opportunity to enlist recruits and to organize his men for the better  accomplishment of what was the real object of his going to Nicaragua. He  now had under him a remarkable force, one of the most effective known  to military history. For although six months had not yet passed,  the organization he now commanded was as unlike the Phalanx of  the fifty-eight adventurers who were driven back at Rivas, as were  Falstaff's followers from the regiment of picked men commanded by  Colonel Roosevelt. Instead of the undisciplined and lawless now being  in the majority, the ranks were filled with the pick of the California  mining camps, with veterans of the Mexican War, with young Southerners  of birth and spirit, and with soldiers of fortune from all of the great  armies of Europe.    In the Civil War, which so soon followed, and later in the service of  the Khedive of Egypt, were several of Walker's officers, and for years  after his death there was no war in which one of the men trained by him  in the jungles of Nicaragua did not distinguish himself. In his memoirs,  the Englishman, General Charles Frederic Henningsen, writes that though  he had taken part in some of the greatest battles of the Civil War he  would pit a thousand men of Walker's command against any five thousand  Confederate or Union soldiers. And General Henningsen was one who spoke  with authority. Before he joined Walker he had served in Spain under Don  Carlos, in Hungary under Kossuth, and in Bulgaria.    Of Walker's men, a regiment of which he commanded, he writes: \"I often  have seen them march with a broken or compound fractured arm in  splints, and using the other to fire the rifle or revolver. Those with a  fractured thigh or wounds which rendered them incapable of removal, shot  themselves. Such men do not turn up in the average of everyday life, nor  do I ever expect to see their like again. All military science failed  on a suddenly given field before such assailants, who came at a run  to close with their revolvers and who thought little of charging a gun  battery, pistol in hand.\"    Another graduate of Walker's army was Captain Fred Townsend Ward, a  native of Salem, Mass., who after the death of Walker organized and  led the ever victorious army that put down the Tai-Ping rebellion,  and performed the many feats of martial glory for which Chinese Gordon  received the credit. In Shanghai, to the memory of the filibuster, there  are to-day two temples in his honor.    Joaquin Miller, the poet, miner, and soldier, who but recently was a  picturesque figure on the hotel porch at Saratoga Springs, was one of  the young Californians who was \"out with Walker,\" and who later in  his career by his verse helped to preserve the name of his beloved  commander. I. C. Jamison, living to-day in Guthrie, Oklahoma, was a  captain under Walker. When war again came, as it did within four months,  these were the men who made Walker President of Nicaragua.    During the four months in all but title he had been president, and as  such he was recognized and feared. It was against him, not Rivas, that"]]]
