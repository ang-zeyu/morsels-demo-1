Tired out by the day's  ride, we fell asleep before the arrangements for the feast had been  completed. When awakened near midnight, we found that the savory odor from  the huge caldron on the fire had only increased the attraction and the  crowd. The choicest bits were now selected for the guests. These consisted  of pieces of liver, served with lumps of fat from the tail of their  peculiarly fat-tailed sheep. As an act of the highest hospitality, our  host dipped these into some liquid grease, and then, reaching over, placed  them in our mouths with his fingers. It required considerable effort on  this occasion to subject our feelings of nausea to a sense of Kirghiz  politeness. In keeping with their characteristic generosity, every one in  the kibitka must partake in some measure of the feast, although the women,  who had done all the work, must be content with remnants and bones already  picked over by the host. But this disposition to share everything was not  without its other aspect; we also were expected to share everything with  them. We were asked to bestow any little trinket or nick-nack exposed to  view. Any extra nut on the machine, a handkerchief, a packet of tea, or a  lump of sugar, excited their cupidity at once. The latter was considered a  bonbon by the women and younger portion of the spectators. The attractive  daughter of our host, \"Kumiss John,\" amused herself by stealing lumps of  sugar from our pockets. When the feast was ended, the beards were again  stroked, the name of Allah solemnly uttered by way of thanks for the  bounty of heaven, and then each gave utterance to his appreciation of the  meal.    Before retiring for the night, the dervish led the prayers, just as he had  done at sunset. The praying-mats were spread, and all heads bowed toward  Mecca. The only preparation for retiring was the spreading of blankets  from the pile in one of the kibitkas. The Kirghiz are not in the habit of  removing many garments for this purpose, and under the circumstances we  found this custom a rather convenient one. Six of us turned in on the  floor together, forming a semicircle, with our feet toward the fire.  \"Kumiss John,\" who was evidently the pet of the household, had a rudely  constructed cot at the far end of the kibitka.    Vernoye, the old Almati, with its broad streets, low wood and brick  houses, and Russian sign-boards, presented a Siberian aspect. The ruins of  its many disastrous earthquakes lying low on every hand told us at once  the cause of its deserted thoroughfares. The terrible shocks of the year  before our visit killed several hundred people, and a whole mountain in  the vicinity sank. The only hope of its persistent residents is a branch  from the Transsiberian or Transcaspian railroad, or the reannexation by  Russia of the fertile province of Ili, to make it an indispensable depot.  Despite these periodical calamities, Vernoye has had, and is now  constructing, under the genius of the French architect, Paul L. Gourdet,  some of the finest edifices to be found in central Asia. The orphan  asylum, a magnificent three-story structure, is now being built on  experimental lines, to test its strength against earthquake shocks.      [Illustration: FANTASTIC RIDING AT THE SUMMER ENCAMPMENT OF THE    COSSACKS.]    One of the chief incidents of our pleasant sojourn was afforded by  Governor Ivanoff. We were invited to head the procession of the Cossacks  on their annual departure for their summer encampment in the mountains.  After the usual religious ceremony, they filed out from the city  parade-ground. Being unavoidably detained for a few moments, we did not  come up until some time after the column had started. As we dashed by to  the front with the American and Russian flags fluttering side by side from  the handle-bars, cheer after cheer arose from the ranks, and even the  governor and his party doffed their caps in acknowledgment. At the camp we  were favored with a special exhibition of horsemanship. By a single twist  of the rein the steeds would fall to the ground, and their riders crouch  down behind them as a bulwark in battle. Then dashing forward at full  speed, they would spring to the ground, and leap back again into the  saddle, or, hanging by their legs, would reach over and pick up a  handkerchief, cap, or a soldier supposed to be wounded. All these  movements we photographed with our camera. Of the endurance of these  Cossacks and their Kirghiz horses we had a practical test. Overtaking a  Cossack courier in the early part of a day's journey, he became so  interested in the velocipede, as the Russians call the bicycle, that he  determined to see as much of it as possible. He stayed with us the whole  day, over a distance of fifty-five miles. His chief compensation was in  witnessing the surprise of the natives to whom he would shout across the  fields to come and see the _tomasha_, adding in explanation that we were  the American gentlemen who had ridden all the way from America. Our speed  was not slow, and frequently the poor fellow would have to resort to the  whip, or shout, \"Slowly, gentlemen, my horse is tired; the town is not far  away, it is not necessary to hurry so.\" The fact is that in all our  experience we found no horse of even the famed Kirghiz or Turkoman breed  that could travel with the same ease and rapidity as ourselves even over  the most ordinary road.    At Vernoye we began to glean practical information about China, but all  except our genial host, M. Gourdet, counseled us against our proposed  journey. He alone, as a traveler of experience, advised a divergence from  the Siberian route at Altin Imell, in order to visit the Chinese city of  Kuldja, where, as he said, with the assistance of the resident Russian  consul we could test the validity of the Chinese passport received, as  before mentioned, from the Chinese minister at London.    A few days later we were rolling up the valley of the Ili, having crossed  that river by the well-constructed Russian bridge at Fort Iliysk, the head  of navigation for the boats from Lake Balkash. New faces here met our  curious gaze. As an ethnological transition between the inhabitants of  central Asia and the Chinese, we were now among two distinctly  agricultural races--the Dungans and Taranchis. As the invited guests of  these people on several occasions, we were struck with their extreme  cleanliness, economy, and industry; but their deep-set eyes seem to  express reckless cruelty.      [Illustration: STROLLING MUSICIANS.]    The Mohammedan mosques of this people are like the Chinese pagodas in  outward appearance, while they seem to be Chinese in half-Kirghiz  garments. Their women, too, do not veil themselves, although they are much  more shy than their rugged sisters of the steppes. Tenacious of their  word, these people were also scrupulous about returning favors. Our  exhibitions were usually rewarded by a spread of sweets and yellow Dungan  tea. Of this we would partake beneath the shade of their well-trained  grape-arbors, while listening to the music, or rather discord, of a  peculiar stringed instrument played by the boys. Its bow of two parts was  so interlaced with the strings of the instrument as to play upon two at  every draw. Another musician usually accompanied by beating little sticks  on a saucer.    These are the people who were introduced by the Manchus to replace the  Kalmucks in the Kuldja district, and who in 1869 so terribly avenged upon  their masters the blood they previously caused to flow. The fertile  province of Kuldja, with a population of 2,500,000, was reduced by their  massacres to one vast necropolis. On all sides are canals that have become  swamps, abandoned fields, wasted forests, and towns and villages in ruins,  in some of which the ground is still strewn with the bleached bones of the  murdered.    As we ascended the Ili valley piles of stones marked in succession the  sites of the towns of Turgen, Jarkend, Akkend, and Khorgos, names which  the Russians are already reviving in their pioneer settlements. The  largest of these, Jarkend, is the coming frontier town, to take the place  of evacuated Kuldja. About twenty-two miles east of this point the large  white Russian fort of Khorgos stands bristling on the bank of the river of  that name, which, by the treaty of 1881, is now the boundary-line of the  Celestial empire. On a ledge of rocks overlooking the ford a Russian  sentinel was walking his beat in the solitude of a dreary outpost. He  stopped to watch us as we plunged into the flood, with our Russian telega  for a ferry-boat. \"All's well,\" we heard him cry, as, bumping over the  rocky bottom, we passed from Russia into China. \"Ah, yes,\" we thought;  \" 'All's well that ends well,' but this is only the beginning.\"      [Illustration: THE CUSTOM-HOUSE AT KULDJA.]    A few minutes later we dashed through the arched driveway of the Chinese  custom-house, and were several yards away before the lounging officials  realized what it was that flitted across their vision. \"Stop! Come back!\"  they shouted in broken Russian. Amid a confusion of chattering voices,  rustling gowns, clattering shoes, swinging pigtails, and clouds of opium  and tobacco smoke, we were brought into the presence of the head official.  Putting on his huge spectacles, he read aloud the vise written upon our  American passports by the Chinese minister in London. His wonderment was  increased when he further read that such a journey was being made on the  \"foot-moved carriages,\" which were being curiously fingered by the  attendants. Our garments were minutely scrutinized, especially the  buttons, while our caps and dark-colored spectacles were taken from our  heads, and passed round for each to try on in turn, amid much laughter.

They therefore (it is       to be hoped) will not arrogate to themselves any little       passages of private histories they may happen to find in these       pages; for, if they do, I shall assuredly hold them up to       public ridicule, by saying, \"as the shoe fits them they are       welcome to wear it.\"         I doubt not that these humble efforts of mine will commend       themselves to your favorable notice. They are (as you will       perceive from this letter) an unpretending mite given to aid in       elevating us in the eyes of the foreign literary world.       \"_Pulchrum est bene facere reipublicae; etiam bene dicere haud       absurdum est._\" Deeming it to be the duty of every American       thus to give his aid to so patriotic a cause, I have the honor       to be your most obedient servant,                                                FRANK MANHATTAN, Jun.      MR. ASHBURNER IN NEW-YORK.    The philosophy of Mr. Harry Benson (on the occasion when Mr. Harry  Benson was last before the public), like the philosophy of many other  eminent men, silenced his auditors if it did not convince them. Karl  Benson growled out something about its being well enough to say so now,  and seemed rather annoyed that Harry should have been more philosophical  than he was himself; while Ashburner laughed good-naturedly, and said  that _that_ was very good philosophy, and he liked to hear it. The  reader will remember that the occasion and philosophy to which we allude  were, respectively, the dinner at Mr. Karl Benson's, and a conversation  in which Mr. Harry Benson expressed it as his decided opinion that  living in a country where one could eat woodcock and drink claret  without having to pay very high taxes or do any hard work, was much  better than some other things which he then and there suggested. But in  the silence which often falls over a small dinner circle, and over a  circle where there are good talkers and gay fellows to be found, Karl  Benson thought that woodcock and claret, though essential to his  comfortable existence, were not the only things he wanted; and Ashburner  made up his mind, and more rapidly than was his custom, that the  pleasures and comforts which Harry had so glowingly described were not  sufficient to engross the mind of an intelligent man, even though  parliamentary fame required the sacrifice of twelve hours per day amid  red tape and blue books, and the management of a government carried with  it responsibility and care. Some other things which Harry had dropped in  his rattling dissertation about living in one of the two great abodes of  freedom, had struck Ashburner's youthful mind, and, without well knowing  why, he determined that neither of the brothers were right, and that he  would look a little deeper into matters and things for himself before  utterly condemning either politics or politicians, or public men or  public measures, in the model republic.    When the silence we have just alluded to had continued a few moments,  Karl suddenly rose from the table, and said, \"Come, boys, since you are  not drinking your wine, and since Harry has talked himself out, I move  that we go over the river, as we agreed to before dinner.\" \"Pshaw,\" said  Harry, slowly rising, and following his brother and Ashburner, who led  the way, \"what an uneasy mortal you are, Karl! just as Ashburner had  begun his wine, and we were about enjoying ourselves, you haul us off on  your confounded expedition.\" \"Never mind,\" rejoined Karl, quietly, \"it's  a pleasant evening, and I want to show Ashburner what a plain American  country gentleman is: that's a thing you have not shown him yet; and  then, there's a pretty girl to be seen, too--you forget that Ashburner  isn't married.\" \"What do you suppose Ashburner wants to see a country  belle for?\" said Harry; \"you know he's been in society these two or  three years.\" \"I don't care whether he has or not,\" Karl replied, \"we  will show him as pretty a lass as any he has seen; and besides, I saw  old Edwards this morning, and told him I was coming over, and, as I am  not going alone, you fellows must go along. By the by, shall we have up  the waggon, or walk down?\" Both gentlemen voted in favor of walking, so  the three took their hats, lit fresh cigars, and slowly sauntered  towards the river. Karl turned back for a moment, to order the waggon to  be at the dock by ten o'clock; and, after sending forward two of his men  who were to act as boatmen, joined his friends.    The dinner hour of Karl Benson was the hour at which the leading members  of New-York society, in the ordinary routine of life, sat down to their  respective tables--that is, three o'clock. It is singular how this  important period recedes from the meridian as people grow more refined  in their own opinions, or more fashionable in those of their neighbors.  The hard-working farmer or mechanic has his dinner at the matin hour of  twelve; the country doctor or village lawyer stands upon his dignity  and dines at one; in country towns, of twenty or thirty thousand  inhabitants, the \"good society\" feels obliged to dine at two; when you  reach the great metropolis (\"which is American penny-a-liner for\"  New-York), you find the dinner postponed to three; and some gentlemen,  with English education and English habits, dine in New-York at five;  while others, whose business keeps them at the bank, or court, or  counting-house till three, have the witching time adjourned to four.  These are, however, only exceptions to the rule, and as lawyers say,  _exceptio probat regulam_; the legitimate, healthy, fashionable hour for  dining--that in which the Knickerbockers, who know no banks or  counting-houses, or dusty courts, save through checks, friends, and  lawyers, dine, is three. Modern degeneracy or refinement, or both, it is  whispered, have lately carried it to half-past, but on the day of which  we write it was precisely three.    To return from this digression to our history--which, as the reader has  doubtless observed, is not a vulgar description of fictitious persons  and imaginary circumstances, but a veracious chronicle of facts, and  much above the level of ordinary romances, inasmuch as truth is always  stranger than fiction--the early dining hour of the aristocratic Benson  (early in an English sense, of course we mean), enabled the three  gentlemen to step out on the lawn just as the sun was sinking behind the  Kaatskills. After a good dinner, most intellectual men become, or are  apt to become, sentimental; and as Ashburner and the Bensons were to the  best of their belief eminently intellectual, they of course became so,  as in duty bound; for every one is under obligations to conform to the  settled usages of good society. \"What a charming picture,\" said Harry  Benson; \"I swear it is sublime!\" \"Yes,\" said Ashburner, poetically,  \"such a scene as that disgusts one with the noise and bustle and  confounded nonsense of city life.\" \"True,\" said Karl, who suddenly  imagined himself for some reason a very wise and exemplary individual, a  sort of martyr for principle; \"you fellows have no idea of the happiness  of a plain country gentleman, living without care or ceremony--having  none of the restraints of society, none of your artificial  wants--everything simple and unsophisticated. Why, if you knew what it  was, you'd give up all thoughts of town, and be living in the country  before another month is past.\"    This speech of Karl was all very fine, but unfortunately it was rather  long, and before Ashburner and Harry Benson could promise the simple,  unsophisticated, contented, happy country gentleman before them, that  they would follow his wise example, they had time to remember, one, that  about three hours before he had heard the same gentleman complain of the  difficulty of getting servants, shops, &c., in the (American) country;  and the other, that, \"to tell the truth, the country was all very well  about sundown, but was deuced dull and uncomfortable on rainy days.\"  Ashburner, however, felt that the remarks of his host should not be  thrown away, at least before his face; so he looked around for a  subject, and politely began to talk of farming. On their right lay a  newly-ploughed field, over which a workman was passing with measured  stride, sowing some kind of grain on the fresh-turned soil, and close  behind him, anxious to cover the seed before finishing his day's work,  came another laborer with the harrow. Ashburner noticed this, and it  struck him that it was just the topic he wanted; so, turning to Karl, he  said, pointing to the workman, \"You do not follow the classical rule of  agriculture, Mr. Benson; you remember Plautus: \"_Nam semper occant,  prius, quam sarriunt, rustici._\"    \"Very good,\" said Karl, \"but I did not remember it--where is it from?\"    \"From the Captives,\" replied Ashburner; \"don't you remember the slave  Tyndavas uses it, when old Hegio tells him he is a sower and harvester  of crime?\"    \"Oh yes, I believe you are right; but to tell the truth, I'm not much of  an admirer of Plautus.\"    \"Indeed,\" replied Ashburner; \"why I thought you would admire him  extremely; for my part I like his bold unpolished comedies; if it was  not heresy for an Englishman to say so, I should say the _Maenuhm_ was  equal to the Comedy of Errors; and Shakspeare certainly must have  borrowed the idea of his play from Plautus--the resemblance between them  is too close to be accidental.\"    Karl said \"Yes,\" in that cool sort of tone by which people show they  assent to admiration without participating in it, and added something of  there being no language but Greek; at which Harry Benson laughed and  asked him if he was still reviewing his Homer.    Though this was said in raillery, Ashburner remarked that Karl looked  quite pleased, and seemed to take the allusion to Greek and Reviews as a  special compliment. The fact"]]]
