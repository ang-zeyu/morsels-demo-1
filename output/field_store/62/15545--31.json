Adams wrote that  day in his diary: \"Blessed, forever blessed be the name of God.\"    [1850]    But a plenitude of Whigs, not all southern, voted for each of these  gags. The worst one of all was moved by a Whig. The XXVIIth Congress,  strongly whig, voted to retain the gag, which it was left for the  XXVIIIth, strongly democratic, finally to repeal. At the South, slavery  more and more overbore party feeling. Said Dixon, a Kentucky Whig, in  1854, \"Upon the question of slavery I know no Whiggery, no Democracy--I  am a pro-slavery man.\" It should be added, however, that as the  conflict progressed, pro-slavery Whigs became few save in the South, and  that these nearly all soon turned Democrats.    Most humiliating was the vassalage to the slave power displayed by  northern congressmen of both parties, though forming a majority in the  House during all the great days of the slavery battle. The gag history  is one example. Resolutions against unquestionably unconstitutional laws  imprisoning northern seamen at southern ports simply because they were  colored, were tabled in the House by a large majority. Slavery in the  District of Columbia, where Congress had the right of \"exclusive  legislation in all cases whatsoever,\" so that the entire nation was  responsible, defied every effort to abolish it till 1862, after the  Civil War began. Nor was the trade there in aught alleviated till 1850,  when some modification of it was possible as an element of the  compromise described in the preceding chapter. An enlargement of  Missouri, adding to the northwest corner of that State, as slave  territory, a vast tract which the Missouri Compromise had forever  devoted to freedom, being in truth a preliminary repeal of that pact,  was carried without opposition.    The brutal and murderous lawlessness practised against Abolitionists was  praised by northern congressmen often as slavery came up in debate. Even  Senator Silas Wright, of New York, subsequently famous as a foe of  slavery, in remarks upon the reference of anti-slavery petitions,  boasted of the atrocities at Utica in 1835 and of others similar, as  proof that \"resistance to these dangerous and wicked agitators in the  North had reached a point beyond law and above law.\" A bill, in 1836,  for closing the mails to abolitionist literature, another defiance of  the Constitution, Amendment I., secured engrossment in the Senate by the  casting vote of Vice-President Van Buren; Wright, Tallmadge, and  Buchanan also favoring; but failed to pass, nineteen to twenty-five,  because Benton, Clay, and Crittenden had the patriotism to vote nay.    Discussion hereon laid bare the vital contradiction in our governmental  system. Calhoun showed that the Constitution permits each State for  itself to define, in order to inhibit, incendiary literature.  Characteristically, he would have forced mail agents to obey state laws  upon this matter. Yet for Congress to have so directed would plainly  have been abridging freedom of the press.      [Illustration: Portrait.]  Thomas H. Benton.      Had the Whig Party, while in power from 1849 to 1853, been brave enough  boldly to assume a rational anti-slavery attitude, though it might have  been defeated, as it was in 1852, it would have had a future. The chance  passed unimproved. The temporizing attitude of the party's then leaders  and the known pro-slavery feeling of most of its southern  members--twelve Whigs voting in the House for the repeal of the Missouri  Compromise--proved deadly to the organization, its faithful old  battalions going over in the South to the Democrats, in the North to the  Republicans.    Many Whigs took the latter course by a circuitous route. Ever since the  alien and sedition laws, cry had been raised at intervals against the  too easy attainment of citizenship by the unnumbered immigrants  thronging to our shores, and agitation raised, more or less successful,  to thrust forward \"Nativism\" or Americanism, with opposition to the  Roman Catholic Church, as an issue in our politics. To such movements  Whigs, as legatees of Federalism, were always more friendly than  Democrats, which was partly a cause and partly a consequence of the  affinity that naturalized citizens all along showed for the Democratic  Party.    Americanism had its greatest run after 1850, when the Whigs saw their  organization going to pieces, and, mistakenly in part, attributed  democratic success to the immigrant vote. A secret fraternity arose,  called the \"Know-nothings,\" from \"I don't know,\" the ever-repeated reply  of its members to inquiry about its nature and doings. \"America for  Americans\" was their cry, and they proposed to \"put none but Americans  on guard.\" At first pursuing their aims through silent manipulation of  the old parties, by 1854 the Know-nothings swung out as a third party.  From this date they lustily competed with the Republicans for the hosts  of whig and democratic stragglers jostled from their old ranks by the  omnibus bill legislation, the Kansas-Nebraska act, and the \"Crime  against Kansas\" committed by Pierce and his slavocratic Senate. In 1855  this party assumed national proportions, and worried seasoned  politicians not a little; but having crystallized around no living  issue, like that which nerved Republicanism, it fell like a  rocket-stick, its sparks going over to make redder still republican  fires. Henry Wilson became a Republican from the status of a  Know-nothing; so did Banks, Colfax, and a score of others subsequently  eminent among their new associates. Some had of old been Democrats,  though most had been Whigs.    Notwithstanding many appearances to the contrary, the Democracy had  begun to lose its hold upon the North from the moment of Polk's  nomination in 1844. In that act it showed preference, on the score of  availability, for a small man as presidential candidate. Harrison's  election and Van Buren's defeat in 1840 doubtless had something to do  with this. The same disposition was revealed in 1852, when Pierce was  made candidate. What harmed the party still more was swerving from  strict construction in declaring for the annexation of Texas, which in  this case did not imply enlargement of view in reading the Constitution,  but simply subserviency to the slave power. In this way Van Buren was  alienated and the vote of New York lost in 1848, insuring defeat that  year.    [1856-1860]    This particular breach was pretty well healed, but the evil survived.  Then came the compromise repeal, wherein the Democracy stood by the  South in casting to the winds, the moment it promised to be of service  to the North, a solemn bargain which had yielded the South Florida,  Arkansas, and Missouri as slave States. Northern Democrats, especially  in the rural parts, unwilling longer to serve slavery, drew off from the  party in increasing numbers. Northern States one by one passed to the  opposition. The whole of New England had gone over in 1856, also New  York, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Iowa--Buchanan having six votes  outside those of Pennsylvania, where he won, as many believed, by unfair  means. In 1860, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, California, Illinois, Indiana,  Minnesota, and Oregon crossed to the same side.        CHAPTER VII.    THE CRISIS    [1850]    The repeal of the Missouri Compromise was politically a remarkable  epoch. It not only consolidated old anti-slavery men, but cooled, to say  the least, many \"silvergray,\" or conservative Whigs, as well as many  \"hards\" and \"hunkers\" among the Democrats. But the slavocrats were blind  to the risk they were running, and grew bolder than ever. There were now  propositions for renewing the foreign slave-trade. Worse black laws were  enacted. There was increased ferocity toward all who did not pronounce  slavery a blessing, prouder domineering in politics, especially in  Congress, and perpetual threat of secession in case the slave power  should fail to have its way.      [Illustration: Portrait.]  Abraham Lincoln. After a rare photograph in the possession of Noah  Brooks. (Only five copies of this photograph were printed.)      There were also plans for foreign conquest in slavery's behalf, which  received countenance from public and even from national authorities. The  idea seemed to be that the victory and territorial enlargement  consequent upon the Mexican War might be repeated in Central America and  Cuba. The efforts of Lopez in 1850 and 1851 to conquer Cuba with aid  from the United States had indeed been brought to an end through this  adventurer's execution in the latter year by the Cuban authorities.  Pierce put forth a proclamation in 1854, warning American citizens  against like attempts in future. Defying this, the next year William  Walker headed a filibustering expedition to the Pacific coast of  Nicaragua, conquering the capital of that state and setting up a  government which proceeded to re-establish slavery and invite  immigration from the United States. Driven out by a coalition of other  Central American states against him, Walker at once organized a new  raid, and landed at Punta Arenas, Nicaragua, November 25, 1857; but he  was seized by Commodore Paulding of our navy and brought to New York. He  made a similar effort the next year, and another in 1860, when he  captured Truxillo in Honduras, only to be soon overwhelmed, tried and  shot.    [1852]    If the Government at Washington was not openly implicated in any of  these movements, no more, surely, did it heartily deprecate them.  Fillmore's administration had in 1852 declined to enter into an alliance  with Great Britain and France disclaiming intention to secure Cuba. In  1854, inspired by Pierce, our ministers at London, Paris, and Madrid,  met at Ostend and put forth the \"Ostend Manifesto.\" The tenor of this  was that Spain would be better off without Cuba and we with it, and  further, that, if Spain refused to sell,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23755"],[0,"Birds of the Indian Hills (#20)"],[1,"  continued to feed the young one, notwithstanding the fact that the  nest had been so greatly damaged. The eggs are white, like those of  all species which habitually nest in holes.          _PART II_  _The Common Birds of the Nilgiris_          _THE COMMON BIRDS OF THE NILGIRIS_      The avifauna of the Nilgiris is considerably smaller than that of  the Himalayas. This phenomenon is easily explained. The Nilgiris  occupy a far less extensive area; they display less diversity of  climate and scenery; the lofty peaks, covered with eternal snow, which  form the most conspicuous feature of the Himalayan landscape, are  wanting in the Nilgiris.    The birds found in and about a Nilgiri hill station differ in character  from those of the plains distant but a score of miles.    Of the common birds of the plains of Madras, the only ones that are  really abundant on the Nilgiris are the black crow, the sparrow, the  white-eye, the Madras bulbul, the myna, the purple sunbird, the  tailor-bird, the ashy wren-warbler, the rufous-backed shrike, the  white-browed fantail flycatcher, the Indian pipit, the Indian  skylark, the common kingfisher, the pied crested cuckoo, the  scavenger vulture, the Pondicherry vulture, the white-backed vulture,  the shikra, the spotted dove, and the little brown dove.    The distribution of the avifauna of mountainous countries is largely  a matter of elevation. At the base of the Nilgiris all the plains  birds of the neighbourhood occur, and most of them extend some way  up the hillsides. The majority, however, do not ascend as high as  1000 feet.    At elevations of 3000 feet the avifauna of the hills is already  markedly different from that of the plains; nevertheless many of the  hill species do not descend to this level, at any rate in the summer.    It is, therefore, necessary, when speaking of a plains bird as  occurring or not occurring on the hills, to define precisely what  is intended by this expression.    That which follows is written for people who visit the Nilgiri hill  stations in the hot weather, and therefore the birds described are  those which occur at elevations of 5500 feet and upwards in the summer.  Those which visit the hills only in winter are either altogether  ignored or given but the briefest mention.    This article does not deal exhaustively with the birds of the  Nilgiris; it is merely a short account of the birds commonly seen  in the higher regions of those hills during the summer months. To  compile an exhaustive list would be easy. I refrain from doing so  because a reader unacquainted with Indian ornithology would, if  confronted by such a list, find it difficult to identify the common  birds.    With this by way of introduction, I will proceed to describe the birds  in question, dealing with them according to the classification  adopted in the standard book on Indian ornithology--the bird volumes  of the \"Fauna of British India\" series.      THE CORVIDAE OR CROW FAMILY    This family is not nearly so well represented on the Nilgiris as it  is in the Himalayas. The only crow found on the Nilgiris is the Indian  corby (_Corvus macrorhynchus_)--the large black crow familiar to  persons living in the plains. He, alas, is plentiful in the various  hill stations; but it is some consolation that the grey-necked  _Corvus_ ceases from troubling those who seek the cool heights.    Like the grey-necked crow, the Indian tree-pie is not found at the  Nilgiri hill stations--5000 feet appears to be the highest elevation  to which he attains.    Of the tits only one species can be said to be common on the higher  Nilgiris: this is the Indian grey tit (_Parus atriceps_)--a striking  little bird, smaller than a sparrow. The head, throat, and neck are  black, and a strip of this hue runs down the middle of the abdomen.  The wings and tail are grey. The cheeks, the sides of the abdomen,  and a patch on the back of the head are white. There is also a narrow  white bar in the wing, and the grey tail is edged with white. The  bird is found all over India, but is far more abundant on the hills  than in the plains.    Another tit which, I believe, does not ascend so high as Ootacamund,  but which is not uncommon in the vicinity of Coonoor is the southern  yellow tit (_Machlolophus haplonotus_). This bird is not, as its name  would seem to imply, clothed from head to foot in yellow. Its  prevailing hues are green and brown. The head, breast, and upper  abdomen are bright yellow, except the crown, crest, a broad streak  behind the eye, and a band running from the chin to the abdomen, which  are black. It is impossible to mistake this sprightly little bird,  which is like the English tom-tit in shape. Tits are arboreal in  habits; they seldom descend to the ground. Sometimes they go about  in small flocks. They are supposed to live chiefly on insects, but  most of them feed on fruit and seeds also, and the grey tit, alas,  eats peas, among which it works sad havoc. The inhabitants of the  Nilgiris call this last _Puttani kurivi_, which, I understand, means  the pea-bird.      THE CRATEROPODIDAE OR BABBLER FAMILY    This heterogeneous family is well represented in the Nilgiris.    The Madras seven sisters (_Crateropus griseus_) do not ascend the  hills to any considerable height. But, of course there are seven  sisters in the hills. Every part of India has its flocks of babblers.  The Nilgiri babbler is a shy bird; it seems to dislike being watched.  One might think it is aware that it is not so beautiful as it might  be. But this cannot be the reason, because it has no objection to  any person hearing its voice, which may be likened to the squeak of  a rusty axle. This Nilgiri babbler does not enter gardens unless they  are somewhat unkempt and contain plenty of thick bushes.    _Mirabile dictu_, this shy and retiring bird is none other than the  jungle babbler (_Crateropus canorus_)--the common seven sisters or  _sath bhai_--which in northern India is as bold and almost as  confiding as the robin. No one has attempted to explain why the habits  of this species on the Nilgiris should differ so much from those it  displays in other places.    The southern scimitar-babbler (_Pomatorhinus horsfieldi_), like the  jungle babbler on the Nilgiris, is a bird heard more often than seen.    Every person who has spent any time at Coonoor must be well acquainted  with the notes of this species. A common call is a loud  _ko-ko-ko-e-e-e_. Sometimes one bird calls _ko-ko-ko_, and another  answers _ko-ee_. When the birds are feeding in company, they keep  up a continual chatter, which is not unpleasing to the ear. When  alarmed they give vent to a harsh cry of a kind characteristic of  the babbler tribe. The scimitar-babbler is a bird nearly as big as  a myna. It is of brownish hue and has a tail of moderate length. The  breast and chin are pure white, and there is a white line running  along each side of the head from front to back. The yellow beak is  long and curved, hence the adjectival \"scimitar.\" It is impossible  to mistake the bird. The difficulty is to obtain anything more than  a fleeting glimpse of it. It is so shy that it takes cover the instant  it knows that it is being watched. It hops about in thick bushes with  considerable address, much as a crow-pheasant does. It feeds on  insects, which it picks off the ground or from leaves and trunks of  trees. It uses the long bill as a probe, by means of which it secures  insects lurking in the crevices of bark.    The Nilgiri laughing-thrush (_Trochalopterum cachinnans_) is a very  common bird on the hills. Like the two species of babbler already  described, it is a shy creature, living amid thick shrubs, from which  it seldom ventures far. The head is slightly crested, the upper  plumage, including the wings and tail, is olive brown. The head is  set off by a white eyebrow. The under parts are chestnut. The beak  and legs are black. Laughing-thrushes congregate in small flocks.  They subsist chiefly on fruit. Their cry is loud and characteristic;  it may be described as a bird's imitation of human laughter. Their  cheerful calls are among the sounds heard most often at Ootacamund  and Coonoor.    The Indian white-eye (_Zosterops palpebrosa_) is a bird that has  puzzled systematists. Jerdon classed it among the tits, and its habits  certainly justify the measure; but later ornithologists have not  accepted the dictum \"Manners makyth bird,\" and have placed the  white-eye among the babblers.    The white-eye is a plump little bird, considerably smaller than a  sparrow. The head and back are yellowish green, becoming almost golden  in the sunlight. The wings and tail are brown. The chin, breast, and  feathers under the tail are bright yellow, the abdomen is white. Round  the eye is a ring of white feathers, interrupted in front by a black  patch.    From this ring--its most striking feature--the bird has derived its  name. The ring is very regular, and causes the bird to look as though  it had been decorating its eye with Aspinall's best enamel.    White-eyes invariably go about in flocks; each member of the company  utters unceasingly a cheeping note in order to keep his fellows  apprized of his movements. These birds feed largely on insects, which  they pick off leaves in truly tit-like manner, sometimes even hanging  head downwards in order to secure a morsel.    The beautiful southern green-bulbul (_Chloropsis malabarica_) is  numbered among the Crateropodidae. It is not a true bulbul. It is  common on the lower slopes of the Nilgiris, but does not often venture  as high as Coonoor. A rich green bulbul-like bird with a golden  forehead, a black chin and throat, and a patch of blue on the wing  can be none other than this species.    The true bulbuls are also classified among the Crateropodidae.    My experience is that the common bulbul of the plains--_Molpastes  haemorrhous_, or the Madras red-vented bulbul--is very rarely seen"]]]
