I myself start for France  shortly. Citizen Chauvelin has provided me with the necessary passport  for myself and my maid, who was to have accompanied me.... Then, just  now, when I was all alone... and thought over all the mischief which  that fiend had forced me to do for him, it seemed to me that perhaps...\"    She broke off abruptly, and tried to read the other woman's face in  the gloom. But Marguerite, who was taller than the Frenchwoman, was  standing, very stiff and erect, giving the young actress neither  discouragement nor confidence. She did not interrupt Candeille's long  and voluble explanation: vaguely she wondered what it was all about,  and even now when the Frenchwoman paused, Marguerite said nothing, but  watched her quietly as she took a folded paper from the capacious pocked  of her cloak and then held it out with a look of timidity towards Lady  Blakeney.    \"My maid need not come with me,\" said Desiree Candeille humbly. \"I would  far rather travel alone... this is her passport and... Oh! you need not  take it out of my hand,\" she added in tones of bitter self-deprecation,  as Marguerite made no sign of taking the paper from her. \"See! I will  leave it here among the roses!... You mistrust me now... it is only  natural... presently, perhaps, calmer reflection will come... you will  see that my purpose now is selfless... that I only wish to serve you and  him.\"    She stooped and placed the folded paper in the midst of a great clump of  centifolium roses, and then without another word she turned and went her  way. For a few moments, whilst Marguerite still stood there, puzzled and  vaguely moved, she could hear the gentle frou-frou of the other woman's  skirts against the soft sand of the path, and then a long-drawn sigh  that sounded like a sob.    Then all was still again. The gentle midnight breeze caressed the tops  of the ancient oaks and elms behind her, drawing murmurs from their  dying leaves like unto the whisperings of ghosts.    Marguerite shuddered with a slight sense of cold. Before her, amongst  the dark clump of leaves and the roses, invisible in the gloom, there  fluttered with a curious, melancholy flapping, the folded paper placed  there by Candeille. She watched it for awhile, as, disturbed by the  wind, it seemed ready to take its flight towards the river. Anon it fell  to the ground, and Marguerite with sudden overpowering impulse, stooped  and picked it up. Then clutching it nervously in her hand, she walked  rapidly back towards the house.          Chapter XV: Farewell        As she neared the terrace, she became conscious of several forms moving  about at the foot of the steps, some few feet below where she was  standing. Soon she saw the glimmer of lanthorns, heard whispering  voices, and the lapping of the water against the side of a boat.    Anon a figure, laden with cloaks and sundry packages, passed down the  steps close beside her. Even in the darkness Marguerite recognized  Benyon, her husband's confidential valet. Without a moment's hesitation,  she flew along the terrace towards the wing of the house occupied by Sir  Percy. She had not gone far before she discerned his tall figure walking  leisurely along the path which here skirted part of the house.    He had on his large caped coat, which was thrown open in front,  displaying a grey travelling suit of fine cloth; his hands were as  usual buried in the pockets of his breeches, and on his head he wore the  folding chapeau-bras which he habitually affected.    Before she had time to think, or to realize that he was going, before  she could utter one single word, she was in his arms, clinging to him  with passionate intensity, trying in the gloom to catch every expression  of his eyes, every quiver of the face now bent down so close to her.    \"Percy, you cannot go... you cannot go!...\" she pleaded.    She had felt his strong arms closing round her, his lips seeking hers,  her eyes, her hair, her clinging hands, which dragged at his shoulders  in a wild agony of despair.    \"If you really loved me, Percy,\" she murmured, \"you would not go, you  would not go...\"    He would not trust himself to speak; it well-nigh seemed as if his  sinews cracked with the violent effort at self-control. Oh! how she  loved him, when she felt in him the passionate lover, the wild, untamed  creature that he was at heart, on whom the frigid courtliness of manner  sat but as a thin veneer. This was his own real personality, and there  was little now of the elegant and accomplished gentleman of fashion,  schooled to hold every emotion in check, to hide every thought, every  desire save that for amusement or for display.    She--feeling her power and his weakness now--gave herself wholly to his  embrace, not grudging one single, passionate caress, yielding her lips  to him, the while she murmured:    \"You cannot go... you cannot... why should you go?... It is madness to  leave me... I cannot let you go...\"    Her arms clung tenderly round him, her voice was warm and faintly shaken  with suppressed tears, and as he wildly murmured: \"Don't! for pity's  sake!\" she almost felt that her love would be triumphant.    \"For pity's sake, I'll go on pleading, Percy!\" she whispered. \"Oh! my  love, my dear! do not leave me!... we have scarce had time to savour our  happiness.. we have such arrears of joy to make up.... Do not go,  Percy... there's so much I want to say to you.... Nay! you shall not!  you shall not!\" she added with sudden vehemence. \"Look me straight in  the eyes, my dear, and tell me if you can leave now?\"    He did not reply, but, almost roughly, he placed his hand over her  tear-dimmed eyes, which were turned up to his, in an agony of tender  appeal. Thus he blindfolded her with that wild caress. She should  not see--no, not even she!--that for the space of a few seconds stern  manhood was well-nigh vanquished by the magic of her love.    All that was most human in him, all that was weak in this strong and  untamed nature, cried aloud for peace and luxury and idleness: for long  summer afternoons spent in lazy content, for the companionship of horses  and dogs and of flowers, with no thought or cares save those for the  next evening's gavotte, no graver occupation save that of sitting at HER  feet.    And during these few seconds, whilst his hand lay across her eyes, the  lazy, idle fop of fashionable London was fighting a hand-to-hand fight  with the bold leader of a band of adventurers: and his own passionate  love for his wife ranged itself with fervent intensity on the side of  his weaker self. Forgotten were the horrors of the guillotine, the  calls of the innocent, the appeal of the helpless; forgotten the daring  adventures, the excitements, the hair's-breadth escapes; for those few  seconds, heavenly in themselves, he only remembered her--his wife--her  beauty and her tender appeal to him.    She would have pleaded again, for she felt that she was winning in this  fight: her instinct--that unerring instinct of the woman who loves and  feels herself beloved--told her that for the space of an infinitesimal  fraction of time, his iron will was inclined to bend; but he checked her  pleading with a kiss.    Then there came a change.    Like a gigantic wave carried inwards by the tide, his turbulent emotion  seemed suddenly to shatter itself against a rock of self-control. Was  it a call from the boatmen below? a distant scrunching of feet upon the  gravel?--who knows, perhaps only a sigh in the midnight air, a ghostly  summons from the land of dreams that recalled him to himself.    Even as Marguerite was still clinging to him, with the ardent fervour of  her own passion, she felt the rigid tension of his arms relax, the power  of his embrace weaken, the wild love-light become dim in his eyes.    He kissed her fondly, tenderly, and with infinite gentleness smoothed  away the little damp curls from her brow. There was a wistfulness now in  his caress, and in his kiss there was the finality of a long farewell.    \"'Tis time I went,\" he said, \"or we shall miss the tide.\"    These were the first coherent words he had spoken since first she  had met him here in this lonely part of the garden, and his voice  was perfectly steady, conventional and cold. An icy pang shot through  Marguerite's heart. It was as if she had been abruptly wakened from a  beautiful dream.    \"You are not going, Percy!\" she murmured, and her own voice now sounded  hollow and forced. \"Oh! if you loved me you would not go!\"    \"If I love you!\"    Nay! in this at least there was no dream! no coldness in his voice when  he repeated those words with such a sigh of tenderness, such a world of  longing, that the bitterness of her great pain vanished, giving place to  tears. He took her hand in his. The passion was momentarily conquered,  forced within his innermost soul, by his own alter ego, that second  personality in him, the cold-blooded and coolly-calculating adventurer  who juggled with his life and tossed it recklessly upon the sea of  chance 'twixt a doggerel and a smile. But the tender love lingered on,  fighting the enemy a while longer, the wistful desire was there for her  kiss, the tired longing for the exquisite repose of her embrace.    He took her hand in his, and bent his lips to it, and with the warmth of  his kiss upon it, she felt a moisture like a tear.    \"I must go, dear,\" he said, after a little while.    \"Why? Why?\" she repeated obstinately. \"Am I nothing then? Is my life  of no account? My sorrows? My fears? My misery? Oh!\" she added with  vehement bitterness, \"why should it always be others? What are others  to you and to me, Percy?... Are we not happy here?... Have you not  fulfilled to its uttermost that self-imposed duty to people who can be  nothing to us?... Is not your life ten thousand times more precious to  me than the lives of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27868"],[0,"The Glow-Worm and Other Beetles (#20)"],[1,"are puny dwarfs  compared with their companions; the more plentiful fall to the  females. The parasitic grub to which fate has allotted the scanty  masculine ration has not perhaps sufficient with this share; it wants  an extra portion, which it can obtain by changing its cell. If it be  favoured by chance, it will eat according to the measure of its hunger  and will attain the full development of which its race allows; if it  wander about without finding anything, it will fast and will remain  small. This would explain the differences which I note in both the  grubs and the pseudochrysalids, differences amounting in linear  dimensions to a hundred per cent and more. The rations, rare or  abundant according to the cells lit upon, would determine the size of  the parasite.    [Footnote 4: The essay on the Tachytes has not yet appeared in  English. It will form part of a volume entitled _More Hunting  Wasps_.--_Translator's Note_.]    During the active period, the larva undergoes a few moults; I have  witnessed at least one of these. The creature stripped of its skin  appears as it was before, without any change of form. It instantly  resumes its meal, which was interrupted while the old skin was shed;  it embraces with its legs another Mantis on the heap and proceeds to  nibble her. Whether simple or multiple, this moult has nothing in  common with the renewals due to the hypermetamorphosis, which so  profoundly change the creature's appearance.    Ten days' rearing in the partitioned box is enough to prove how right  I was when I looked upon the parasitic larva feeding on Mantes as the  origin of the pseudochrysalis, the object of my eager attention. The  creature, which I kept supplied with additional food as long as it  accepted it, stops eating at last. It becomes motionless, retracts its  head slightly and bends itself into a hook. Then the skin splits  across the head and down the thorax. The tattered slough is thrust  back; and the pseudochrysalis appears in sight, absolutely naked. It  is white at first, as the larva was; but by degrees and fairly rapidly  it turns to the russet hue of virgin wax, with a brighter red at the  tips of the various tubercles which indicate the future legs and  mouth-parts. This shedding of the skin, which leaves the body of the  pseudochrysalis uncovered, recalls the mode of transformation observed  in the Oil-beetles and is different from that of the Sitares and the  Zonites, whose pseudochrysalis remains wholly enveloped in the skin of  the secondary larva, a sort of bag which is sometimes loose, sometimes  tight and always unbroken.    The mist that surrounded us at the outset is dispelled. This is indeed  a Meloid, a true Meloid, one of the strangest anomalies among the  parasites of its tribe. Instead of living on the honey of a Bee, it  feeds on the skewerful of Mantes provided by a Tachytes. The  North-American naturalists have taught us lately that honey is not  always the diet of the Blister-beetles: some Meloidae in the United  States devour the packets of eggs laid by the Grasshoppers. This is a  legitimate acquisition on their part, not an illegal seizure of the  food-stores of others. No one, as far as I am aware, had as yet  suspected the true parasitism of a carnivorous Meloid. It is  nevertheless very remarkable to find in the Blister-beetles, on both  sides of the Atlantic, this weakness for the flavour of Locust: one  devours her eggs; the other a representative of the order, in the  shape of the Praying Mantis and her kin.    Who will explain to me this predilection for the Orthopteron in a  tribe whose chief, the Oil-beetle, accepts nothing but the mess of  honey? Why do insects which appear close together in all our  classifications possess such opposite tastes? If they spring from a  common stock, how did the consumption of flesh supplant the  consumption of honey? How did the Lamb become a Wolf? This is the  great problem which was once set us, in an inverse form, by the  Spotted Sapyga, a honey-eating relative of the flesh-eating Scolia.[5]  I submit the question to whom it may concern.    [Footnote 5: The essays on these will appear in the volume, entitled  _The Hunting Wasps_, aforementioned.--_Translator's Note_.]    The following year, at the beginning of June, some of my  pseudochrysalids split open transversely behind the head and  lengthwise down the whole of the median line of the back, except the  last two or three segments. From it emerges the tertiary larva, which,  from a simple examination with the pocket-lens, appears to me, in its  general features, identical with the secondary larva, the one which  eats the Tachytes' provisions. It is naked and pale-yellow, the colour  of butter. It is active and wriggles with awkward movements.  Ordinarily it lies upon its side, but it can also stand in the normal  position. The creature is then trying to use its legs, without finding  sufficient purchase to enable it to walk. A few days later, it  relapses into complete repose.    Thirteen segments, including the head, which is large, with a  quadrilateral cranium, rounded at the sides. Short antennae,  consisting of three knotted joints. Powerful curved mandibles, with  two or three little teeth at the end, of a fairly bright red. Labial  palpi rather bulky, short and with three joints, like the antennae.  The mouth-parts, labrum, mandibles and palpi are movable and stir  slightly, as though seeking food. A small brown speck near the base of  each antenna, marking the place of the future eyes. Prothorax wider  than the segments that come after it. These are all of one width and  are distinctly divided by a furrow and a slight lateral rim. Legs  short, transparent, without a terminal claw. They are three-jointed  stumps. Pale stigmata, eight pairs of them, placed as in the  pseudochrysalis, that is, the first and largest pair on the line  dividing the first two segments of the thorax and the seven others on  the first seven abdominal segments. The secondary larva and the  pseudochrysalis also have a very small stigma on the penultimate  segment of the abdomen. This stigma has disappeared in the tertiary  larva; at least I cannot detect it with the aid of a good  magnifying-glass.    Lastly, we find the same strong mandibles as in the secondary larva,  the same feeble legs, the same appearance of a Weevil-grub. The  movements return, but are less clearly marked than in the primary  form. The passage through the pseudochrysalid state has led to no  change that is really worth describing. The creature, after this  singular phase, is what it was before. The Meloes and Sitares, for  that matter, behave similarly.    Then what can be the meaning of this pseudochrysalid stage, which,  when passed, leads precisely to the point of departure? The Meloid  seems to be revolving in a circle: it undoes what it has just done, it  draws back after advancing. The idea sometimes occurs to me to look  upon the pseudochrysalis as a sort of egg of a superior organization,  starting from which the insect follows the ordinary law of  entomological phases and passes through the successive stages of  larva, nymph and perfect insect. The first hatching, that of the  normal egg, makes the Meloid go through the larval dimorphism of the  Anthrax and the Leucospis. The primary larva finds its way to the  victuals; the secondary larva consumes them. The second hatching, that  of the pseudochrysalis, reverts to the usual course, so that the  insect passes through the three customary forms: larva, nymph, adult.    The tertiary larval stage is of brief duration, lasting about a  fortnight. The larva then sheds its skin by a longitudinal rent along  the back, as did the secondary larva, uncovering the nymph, in which  we recognize the Beetle, the genus and species being almost  determinable by the antennae.    The second year's development turned out badly. The few nymphs which I  obtained about the middle of June shrivelled up without attaining the  perfect form. Some pseudochrysalids remained on my hands without  showing any sign of approaching transformation. I attributed this  delay to lack of warmth. I was in fact keeping them in the shade, on a  what-not, in my study, whereas under natural conditions they are  exposed to the hottest sun, beneath a layer of sand a few inches deep.  To imitate these conditions without burying my charges, whose progress  I wished to follow comfortably, I placed the pseudochrysalids that  remained on a layer of fresh sand at the bottom of a glass receiver.  Direct exposure to the sun was impracticable: it would have been fatal  at a period when life is subterranean. To avoid it, I tied over the  mouth of the receiver a few thicknesses of black cloth, to represent  the natural screen of sand; and the apparatus thus prepared was  exposed for some weeks to the most brilliant sunshine in my window.  Under the cloth cover, which, owing to its colour, favours the  absorption of heat, the temperature, during the day-time, became that  of an oven; and yet the pseudochrysalids persisted in remaining  stationary. The end of July was near and nothing indicated a speedy  hatching. Convinced that my attempts at heating would be fruitless, I  replaced the pseudochrysalids in the shade, on the shelves, in glass  tubes. Here they passed a second year, still in the same condition.    June returned once more and with it the appearance of the tertiary  larva, followed by the nymph. For the second time this stage of  development was not exceeded; the one and only nymph that I succeeded  in obtaining shrivelled, like those of the year before. Will these two  failures, arising no doubt from the overdry atmosphere of my  receivers, conceal from us the genus and the species of the  Mantis-eating Meloid? Fortunately, no. The riddle is easily solved by  deduction and comparison.    The only Melodiae in my part of the country which, though their habits  are"]]]
