Economic conditions have fluctuated with    the changing fortunes of oil since 1985, for example, during and    following the Gulf crisis of 1990-91. With its highly developed    communication and transport facilities, Bahrain is home to numerous    multinational firms with business in the Gulf. A large share of    exports consists of petroleum products made from imported crude.    Unemployment, especially among the young, and the depletion of both    oil and underground water resources are major long-term economic    problems.

However, when President    Carlos MENEM took office in 1989, the country had piled up huge    external debts, inflation had reached 200% per month, and output was    plummeting. To combat the economic crisis, the government embarked    on a path of trade liberalization, deregulation, and privatization.    In 1991, it implemented radical monetary reforms which pegged the    peso to the US dollar and limited the growth in the monetary base by    law to the growth in reserves. Inflation fell sharply in subsequent    years. The Mexican peso crisis produced capital flight, the loss of    banking system deposits, and a severe, but short-lived, recession in    1995; a series of reforms to bolster the domestic banking system    followed."]]]
