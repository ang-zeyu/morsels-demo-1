Sancho Panza stood confounded at his discourse, without speaking a  word; and now and then he turned his head about, to see whether he  could discover the knights and giants his master named. But seeing  none, he said, \"Sir, not a man, or giant, or knight, of all you have  named, can I see any where.\" \"How sayest thou, Sancho?\" answered Don  Quixote; \"hearest thou not the neighing of the steeds, the sound of  the trumpets, and the rattling of the drums?\" \"I hear nothing,\"  answered Sancho, \"but the bleating of sheep and lambs:\" and so it was;  for now the two flocks were come very near them. \"Thy fears, Sancho,\"  said Don Quixote, \"prevent thee from hearing or seeing aright; for one  effect of fear is to disturb the senses and make things not to appear  what they really are: and if thou art so much afraid, retire and leave  me alone; for with my single arm I shall ensure victory to that side  which I favour with my assistance:\" then, clapping spurs to Rozinante,  and setting his lance in his rest, he darted down the hillock like  lightning. Sancho cried out to him: \"Hold, Signor Don Quixote, come  back! they are only lambs and sheep you are going to encounter; pray  come back; what madness is this! there is neither giant, nor knight,  nor horses, nor arms, nor shields quartered or entire, nor true  azures, nor devices: what are you doing, sir?\" Notwithstanding all  this, Don Quixote turned not again, but still went on, crying aloud,  \"Ho, knights, you that follow and fight under the banner of the  valiant Emperor Pentapolin of the Naked Arm, follow me all, and you  shall see with how much ease I revenge him on his enemy Alifanfaron of  Taprobana.\" With these words he rushed into the midst of the squadron  of sheep, as courageously and intrepidly as if in good earnest he was  engaging his mortal enemies. The shepherds and herdsmen who came with  the flocks called out to him to desist; but seeing it was to no  purpose, they unbuckled their slings, and began to salute his ears  with a shower of stones. Don Quixote cared not for the stones, but,  galloping about on all sides, cried out: \"Where art thou, proud  Alifanfaron? Present thyself before me; I am a single knight, desirous  to prove thy valour hand to hand, and to punish thee with the loss of  life for the wrong thou dost to the valiant Pentapolin Garamanta.\" At  that instant a large stone struck him with such violence that he  believed himself either slain or sorely wounded; and remembering some  balsam which he had, he pulled out the cruse, and applying it to his  mouth, began to swallow some of the liquor; but before he could take  what he thought sufficient, another hit him full on the hand, and  dashed the cruse to pieces: carrying off three or four of his teeth by  the way, and grievously bruising two of his fingers. Such was the  first blow, and such the second, that the poor knight fell from his  horse to the ground. The shepherds ran to him, and verily believed  they had killed him; whereupon in all haste they collected their  flock, took up their dead, which were about seven, and marched off  without farther inquiry.    All this while Sancho stood upon the hillock, beholding his master's  actions--tearing his beard, and cursing the unfortunate hour and  moment that ever he knew him. But seeing him fallen to the ground and  the shepherds gone off, he descended from the hillock, and, running to  him, found him in a very ill plight, though not quite bereaved of  sense; and said to him, \"Did I not beg you, Signor Don Quixote, to  come back; for those you went to attack were a flock of sheep, and not  an army of men?\" \"How easily,\" replied Don Quixote, \"can that thief of  an enchanter, my enemy, transform things or make them invisible!  However, do one thing, Sancho, for my sake, to undeceive thyself, and  see the truth of what I tell thee; mount thy ass, and follow them fair  and softly, and thou wilt find that, when they are got a little  farther off, they will return to their first form, and, ceasing to be  sheep, will become men, proper and tall, as I described them at first.  But do not go now; for I want thy assistance; come hither to me, and  see how many of my teeth are deficient; for it seems to me that I have  not one left in my head.\"    He now raised himself up, and placing his left hand on his mouth, to  prevent the remainder of his teeth from falling out, with the other he  laid hold on Rozinante's bridle, who had not stirred from his master's  side, such was his fidelity, and went towards his squire, who stood  leaning with his breast upon the ass, and his cheek reclining upon his  hand, in the posture of a man overwhelmed with thought. Don Quixote,  seeing him thus, and to all appearance so melancholy, said to him,  \"Know, Sancho, that one man is no more than another, only inasmuch as  he does more than another. So do not afflict thyself for the  mischances that befall me, since thou hast no share in them.\" \"How? no  share in them!\" answered Sancho; \"peradventure he they tossed in a  blanket yesterday was not my father's son, and the wallets I have lost  to-day, with all my movables, belong to somebody else?\" \"What! are the  wallets lost?\" quoth Don Quixote. \"Yes, they are,\" answered Sancho.  \"Then we have nothing to eat to-day?\" replied Don Quixote. \"It would  be so,\" answered Sancho, \"if these fields did not produce those herbs  which your worship says you know, and with which unlucky  knights-errant like your worship are used to supply such wants.\"  \"Nevertheless,\" said Don Quixote, \"at this time I would rather have a  slice of bread and a couple of heads of salt pilchards than all the  herbs described by Dioscorides, though commented upon by Doctor Laguna  himself. But, good Sancho, get upon thy ass, and follow me; for God,  who provides for all, will not desert us, since he neglects neither  the birds of the air, the beasts of the earth, nor the fish of the  waters; more especially being engaged, as we are, in his service.\"  \"Your worship,\" said Sancho, \"would make a better preacher than a  knight-errant.\" \"Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"the knowledge of  knights-errant must be universal; there have been knights-errant, in  times past, who would make sermons or harangues on the king's highway  as successfully as if they had taken their degrees in the university  of Paris; whence it may be inferred that the lance never blunted the  pen, nor the pen the lance.\" \"Well, be it as your worship says,\"  answered Sancho; \"but let us begone hence, and endeavour to get a  lodging to-night; and pray God it be where there are neither blankets  or blanket-heavers, hobgoblins or enchanted Moors.\"          CHAPTER XI.    _The sage discourse continued, with the adventures of a dead body._      Thus discoursing, night overtook them, and they were still in the high  road; and the worst of it was, they were famished with hunger: for  with their wallets they had lost their whole larder of provisions,  and, to complete their misfortunes, an adventure now befell them which  appeared indeed to be truly an adventure. The night came on rather  dark; notwithstanding which they saw advancing towards them a great  number of lights, resembling so many moving stars. Sancho stood aghast  at the sight of them, nor was Don Quixote unmoved. The one checked his  ass, and the other his horse, and both stood looking before them with  eager attention. They perceived that the lights were advancing towards  them, and that as they approached nearer they appeared larger. \"I  beseech thee, Sancho, to be of good courage; for experience shall give  thee sufficient proof of mine.\" \"I will, if it please God,\" answered  Sancho; and, retiring a little on one side of the road, and again  endeavouring to discover what those walking lights might be, they soon  after perceived a great many persons clothed in white; this dreadful  spectacle completely annihilated the courage of Sancho, whose teeth  began to chatter, as if seized with a quartan ague. But it was  otherwise with his master, whose lively imagination instantly  suggested to him that this must be truly a chivalrous adventure. He  conceived that the litter was a bier, whereon was carried some knight  sorely wounded or slain, whose revenge was reserved for him alone. He  therefore, without delay, couched his spear, seated himself firm in  his saddle, and, with grace and spirit, advanced into the middle of  the road by which the procession must pass; and when they were near he  raised his voice, and said: \"Ho! knights, whoever ye are, halt, and  give me an account to whom ye belong, whence ye come, whither ye are  going, and what it is ye carry upon that bier; for, in all appearance,  either ye have done some injury to others, or others to you; and it is  expedient and necessary that I be informed of it, either to chastise  ye for the evil ye have done, or to revenge ye of wrongs sustained.\"  \"We are in haste,\" answered one in the procession; \"the inn is a great  way off; and we cannot stay to give so long an account as you  require:\" then, spurring his mule, he passed forward. Don Quixote,  highly resenting this answer, laid hold of his bridle, and said,  \"Stand, and with more civility give me the account I demand; otherwise  I challenge ye all to battle.\" The mule was timid, and started so much  upon his touching the bridle, that, rising on her hind-legs, she threw  her rider over the crupper to the ground. A lacquey that came on foot,  seeing the man in white fall, began to revile Don Quixote; whose  choler being now raised, he couched his spear, and immediately  attacking one of the mourners, laid him on the ground grievously  wounded; then turning about to the rest, it was worth seeing with what  agility he attacked and defeated them; it seemed as if wings at that  instant"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/360"],[0,"What is Property? An Inquiry into the Principle of Right and of Government (#20)"],[1,"by the method of analysis, comparison,  elimination, and reduction (the only means of discovering the truth amid  the various forms of thought and whimsical opinions), he jumbles  all systems together, and then, declaring each both right and wrong,  exclaims: \"There you have the truth.\"    But, adhering to my promise, I will not refute him. I will only prove,  by all the arguments with which he justifies the right of property, the  principle of equality which kills it. As I have already said, my sole  intent is this: to show at the bottom of all these positions that  inevitable major, EQUALITY; hoping hereafter to show that the principle  of property vitiates the very elements of economical, moral, and  governmental science, thus leading it in the wrong direction.    Well, is it not true, from M. Cousin's point of view, that, if the  liberty of man is sacred, it is equally sacred in all individuals; that,  if it needs property for its objective action, that is, for its life,  the appropriation of material is equally necessary for all; that, if I  wish to be respected in my right of appropriation, I must respect  others in theirs; and, consequently, that though, in the sphere of the  infinite, a person's power of appropriation is limited only by  himself, in the sphere of the finite this same power is limited by the  mathematical relation between the number of persons and the space which  they occupy? Does it not follow that if one individual cannot prevent  another--his fellow-man--from appropriating an amount of material equal  to his own, no more can he prevent individuals yet to come; because,  while individuality passes away, universality persists, and eternal laws  cannot be determined by a partial view of their manifestations? Must we  not conclude, therefore, that whenever a person is born, the others must  crowd closer together; and, by reciprocity of obligation, that if the  new comer is afterwards to become an heir, the right of succession does  not give him the right of accumulation, but only the right of choice?    I have followed M. Cousin so far as to imitate his style, and I am  ashamed of it. Do we need such high-sounding terms, such sonorous  phrases, to say such simple things? Man needs to labor in order to live;  consequently, he needs tools to work with and materials to work upon.  His need to produce constitutes his right to produce. Now, this right is  guaranteed him by his fellows, with whom he makes an agreement to that  effect. One hundred thousand men settle in a large country like France  with no inhabitants: each man has a right to 1/100,000 of the land. If  the number of possessors increases, each one's portion diminishes in  consequence; so that, if the number of inhabitants rises to thirty-four  millions, each one will have a right only to 1/34,000,000. Now,  so regulate the police system and the government, labor, exchange,  inheritance, &c., that the means of labor shall be shared by all  equally, and that each individual shall be free; and then society will  be perfect.    Of all the defenders of property, M. Cousin has gone the farthest. He  has maintained against the economists that labor does not establish the  right of property unless preceded by occupation, and against the jurists  that the civil law can determine and apply a natural right, but cannot  create it. In fact, it is not sufficient to say, \"The right of property  is demonstrated by the existence of property; the function of the civil  law is purely declaratory.\" To say that, is to confess that there is  no reply to those who question the legitimacy of the fact itself.  Every right must be justifiable in itself, or by some antecedent right;  property is no exception. For this reason, M. Cousin has sought to base  it upon the SANCTITY of the human personality, and the act by which the  will assimilates a thing. \"Once touched by man,\" says one of M. Cousin's  disciples, \"things receive from him a character which transforms and  humanizes them.\" I confess, for my part, that I have no faith in this  magic, and that I know of nothing less holy than the will of man. But  this theory, fragile as it seems to psychology as well as jurisprudence,  is nevertheless more philosophical and profound than those theories  which are based upon labor or the authority of the law. Now, we have  just seen to what this theory of which we are speaking leads,--to the  equality implied in the terms of its statement.    But perhaps philosophy views things from too lofty a standpoint, and  is not sufficiently practical; perhaps from the exalted summit of  speculation men seem so small to the metaphysician that he cannot  distinguish between them; perhaps, indeed, the equality of conditions is  one of those principles which are very true and sublime as generalities,  but which it would be ridiculous and even dangerous to attempt to  rigorously apply to the customs of life and to social transactions.  Undoubtedly, this is a case which calls for imitation of the wise  reserve of moralists and jurists, who warn us against carrying things to  extremes, and who advise us to suspect every definition; because there  is not one, they say, which cannot be utterly destroyed by developing  its disastrous results--_Omnis definitio in jure civili periculosa  est: parum est enim ut non subverti possit_. Equality of conditions,--a  terrible dogma in the ears of the proprietor, a consoling truth at  the poor-man's sick-bed, a frightful reality under the knife of the  anatomist,--equality of conditions, established in the political, civil,  and industrial spheres, is only an alluring impossibility, an inviting  bait, a satanic delusion.    It is never my intention to surprise my reader. I detest, as I do death,  the man who employs subterfuge in his words and conduct. From the first  page of this book, I have expressed myself so plainly and decidedly that  all can see the tendency of my thought and hopes; and they will do me  the justice to say, that it would be difficult to exhibit more frankness  and more boldness at the same time. I do not hesitate to declare that  the time is not far distant when this reserve, now so much admired in  philosophers--this happy medium so strongly recommended by professors of  moral and political science--will be regarded as the disgraceful feature  of a science without principle, and as the seal of its reprobation. In  legislation and morals, as well as in geometry, axioms are absolute,  definitions are certain; and all the results of a principle are to be  accepted, provided they are logically deduced. Deplorable pride! We know  nothing of our nature, and we charge our blunders to it; and, in a  fit of unaffected ignorance, cry out, \"The truth is in doubt, the  best definition defines nothing!\" We shall know some time whether this  distressing uncertainty of jurisprudence arises from the nature of  its investigations, or from our prejudices; whether, to explain social  phenomena, it is not enough to change our hypothesis, as did Copernicus  when he reversed the system of Ptolemy.    But what will be said when I show, as I soon shall, that this same  jurisprudence continually tries to base property upon equality? What  reply can be made?        % 3.--Civil Law as the Foundation and Sanction of Property.    Pothier seems to think that property, like royalty, exists by divine  right. He traces back its origin to God himself--ab Jove principium. He  begins in this way:--      \"God is the absolute ruler of the universe and all that it contains:  _Domini est terra et plenitudo ejus, orbis et universi qui habitant in  eo_. For the human race he has created the earth and all its creatures,  and has given it a control over them subordinate only to his own. 'Thou  madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put  all things under his feet,' says the Psalmist. God accompanied this gift  with these words, addressed to our first parents after the creation: 'Be  fruitful, and multiply and replenish the earth,'\" &c.      After this magnificent introduction, who would refuse to believe the  human race to be an immense family living in brotherly union, and  under the protection of a venerable father? But, heavens! are brothers  enemies? Are fathers unnatural, and children prodigal?    GOD GAVE THE EARTH TO THE HUMAN RACE: why then have I received none? HE  HAS PUT ALL THINGS UNDER MY FEET,--and I have not where to lay my head!  MULTIPLY, he tells us through his interpreter, Pothier. Ah, learned  Pothier! that is as easy to do as to say; but you must give moss to the  bird for its nest.      \"The human race having multiplied, men divided among themselves the  earth and most of the things upon it; that which fell to each, from that  time exclusively belonged to him. That was the origin of the right of  property.\"      Say, rather, the right of possession. Men lived in a state of communism;  whether positive or negative it matters little. Then there was no  property, not even private possession. The genesis and growth of  possession gradually forcing people to labor for their support, they  agreed either formally or tacitly,--it makes no difference which,--that  the laborer should be sole proprietor of the fruit of his labor; that  is, they simply declared the fact that thereafter none could live  without working. It necessarily followed that, to obtain equality of  products, there must be equality of labor; and that, to obtain equality  of labor, there must be equality of facilities for labor. Whoever  without labor got possession, by force or by strategy, of another's  means of subsistence, destroyed equality, and placed himself above or  outside of the law. Whoever monopolized the means of production on the  ground of greater industry, also destroyed equality. Equality being then  the expression of right, whoever violated it was UNJUST.    Thus, labor gives birth to private possession; the right in"]]]
