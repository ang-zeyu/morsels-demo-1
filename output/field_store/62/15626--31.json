The banking sector, with its \"tax haven\" status, also    contributes substantially to the economy. Agricultural production is    limited - only 2% of the land is arable - and most food has to be    imported. The principal livestock activity is sheep raising.    Manufacturing output consists mainly of cigarettes, cigars, and    furniture. Andorra is a member of the EU Customs Union and is    treated as an EU member for trade in manufactured goods (no tariffs)    and as a non-EU member for agricultural products.

A 1994 peace accord between the government and the    National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) provided    for the integration of former UNITA insurgents into the government    and armed forces. A national unity government was installed in April    of 1997, but serious fighting resumed in late 1998, rendering    hundreds of thousands of people homeless. Up to 1.5 million lives    may have been lost in fighting over the past quarter century. The    death of insurgent leader Jonas SAVIMBI in 2002 and a subsequent    cease-fire with UNITA may bode well for the country.

Economic activity is strongly linked    to the US, with which American Samoa conducts most of its foreign    trade. Tuna fishing and tuna processing plants are the backbone of    the private sector, with canned tuna the primary export. Transfers    from the US Government add substantially to American Samoa's    economic well-being. Attempts by the government to develop a larger    and broader economy are restrained by Samoa's remote location, its    limited transportation, and its devastating hurricanes. Tourism is a    promising developing sector.    GDP:    purchasing power parity - $500 million (2000 est.)
