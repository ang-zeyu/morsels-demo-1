After the second  theme we generally find a closing theme to round out the Exposition as  a whole. This practice dates from Haydn and has been much expanded by  modern composers. Witness the glorious climactic effect in Cesar  Franck's _Symphony_ and in Brahms's _D major Symphony_ of the closing  themes in the Expositions of the first movements. For many years it  was the invariable custom to repeat the Exposition, and in Classic  Symphonies we always find a double bar with marks of repeat and two  endings. This practice was not an integral part of the form but was  adopted so that the hearer, by going over the themes of the Exposition  twice, might follow more intelligently their growth in the  Development. With the advance in public appreciation this repeating of  the Exposition has been largely abandoned; for there is no doubt that  to begin all over again, when a certain objective point has been  reached, breaks the continuous flow of the movement.[98]    [Footnote 96: Some composers have also experimented with still freer  key-relationships.]    [Footnote 97: For striking examples see the Expositions of the first  movements of Beethoven's _Third Symphony_ and of Tchaikowsky's _Sixth  Symphony_.]    [Footnote 98: The ultra-conservative attitude of Brahms is shown by  his retention of the double bar and repeat, although this is often  ignored by modern conductors.]    (2) The Development, for which the Germans have the happy name of  \"Freie Phantasie,\" or free phantasy; the composer thus giving rein to  his imagination and doing whatever he pleases, so long as he holds the  interest of his hearers and neither becomes verbose nor indulges in  mere mechanical manipulation. There are, alas! developments in which  the composer exhausts his themes and his hearers too;[99] but on work  of this kind, since it is not real development but labored jugglery,  no powder need be wasted. Beethoven began the practice, in his  Developments, of not confining himself to the themes of the Exposition  but of introducing an entirely new theme, whenever the main material  had fulfilled its purpose. The single most exciting factor in a good  development is the freedom and wealth of modulation revealed by the  daring genius of the creator; the effect being Plurality of  Key-relationship, in distinction from the two closely related keys of  the Exposition. It would often seem as if we were taken up into high  mountains or borne away to distant seas. For illustrations of this  \"free phantasy\" note the end of the Development in the first movement  of Beethoven's _Second Symphony_ where, after great stress has been  laid in the Exposition on the two basic keys of D major and A major,  we are left in the distant tonality of C-sharp major and are then  whirled back, by a dramatic change, into the home-key of the third  part. One of the most interesting studies in the workings of a great  mind is to observe how Beethoven, in his developments, allows the  excitement to subside and yet never entirely die out, and how deftly  he leads the hearer onward to the summing up of the main themes of the  exposition.    [Footnote 99: It was probably a development of this kind which called  forth the characteristic comment from Debussy who once remarked to a  friend at a concert, \"Let us flee! he is going to develop.\"]    (3) The Recapitulation or Resume, in which both the themes of the  Exposition are reasserted, each in the home key--a strong final  emphasis thus being laid on _Unity_ of Tonality. The bridge-passage  has to be correspondingly changed, for now the modulation is between  two themes _both_ in the _same key_. To achieve such a modulation is  quite a \"tour de force\" as every musician knows, and often taxed the  ingenuity even of the great Beethoven. The skill by which he always  made the second theme sound fresh and vital is astounding. For a case  of \"academic fumbling\"--mere treading of water--in this adjustment of  key relationship, see the Recapitulation of the first movement of  Brahms's Second Symphony. To secure unbroken continuity and to avoid  vain repetitions[100] there is no portion of the Sonata-Form which has  been more modified by the inventive genius of modern composers and by  the tendency exemplified in the Symphonic Poem (to be explained in due  season). The general validity of Restatement, as shown in the  Recapitulation of the Sonata-Form, cannot be questioned; for that  depends, as so often pointed out, upon the human craving to enjoy once  more, after intervening contrast, something which has originally given  pleasure. Furthermore this sound psychological principle finds an  analogy in our own life: with its early years of striving, its middle  period of development and its closing years of climactic retrospect  and satisfaction. There is a corresponding structural treatment in the  denoument of a drama. In the classic composers, the Recapitulation is  almost always a literal repetition of the Exposition, although  Beethoven began to be freer, _e.g._, in the climax of the Coriolanus  overture, where he modifies the form to meet the dramatic needs of the  subject.[101] Modern composers, however, have felt that much of this  repetition was superfluous; and when they do repeat both themes, one  or the other is freely varied and made still more eloquent. For  examples, see the resume of the first movements of Franck's  _Symphony_, of Brahms's _First Symphony_ and of Tchaikowsky's  _Sixth_. The Recapitulation is often abridged by omitting the first  theme altogether and dwelling exclusively on the second; as for  example, in the Finale of Schumann's _Fourth Symphony_ and in  Sinigaglia's Overture, _Le Baruffe Chiozzotte_.[102]    [Footnote 100: See Gretry's amusing comments on the Sonata-Form cited  by Romain Rolland in the essays _Musicians of Former Days_.]    [Footnote 101: See also Wagner's comments on the _Third Leonora  Overture_, cited by Ernest Newman in his _Musical Studies_, pp.  134-135.]    [Footnote 102: Additional illustrations of this treatment may be found  in Chabrier's Overture to _Gwendoline_ and in the first movement of  F.S. Converse's _String Quartet_.]    It remains to speak of the beginning and end of the Sonata-Form. With  Haydn it became the custom, not necessarily invariable, to introduce  the body of the movement by a Prelude which, in early days, was of  slight texture and import--often a mere preliminary \"flourish of  trumpets,\" a presenting of arms. In Mozart we find some examples of  more artistic treatment, notably in the Overture to the _Magic Flute_  and in the prelude to the C major Quartet with its stimulating  dissonances. But in this case, as in so many others, it was Beethoven  who first showed what a Prelude should be: a subtle means of arousing  the interest and expectancy of the hearer; the effect as carefully  planned as the portico leading to a temple. To usher in the theme of  the Exposition in a truly exciting manner every means of modulation  and rhythm is employed; famous illustrations being the introductions  to the first movements of the Second, Fourth and Seventh symphonies;  and, in modern literature, those of the first movements of Brahms's  _First Symphony_ and of Tchaikowsky's _Fifth_. It also became  customary to prolong the end of the movement by what is termed a Coda;  the same tendency being operative that is found in the peroration to a  speech or in the spire of a cathedral, _i.e._, the human instinct to  end whatever we attempt as impressively and completely as possible.  This Coda, which, in Haydn and Mozart, was often a mere iteration of  trite chords--a ceasing to go--was so expanded by Beethoven that it  was the real glory of the whole movement. In fact so many eloquent  treatments of the main material were reserved for the Coda that it  often became a _second_ development; and such was its scope that the  form may be considered to have _four_ parts instead of three, _i.e._,  1, Exposition, 2, Development, 3, Recapitulation, 4, Coda; parts 4 and  2 balancing each other in the same way as 3 and 1. For two of the most  famous examples in all Beethoven literature see the Codas to the First  movement of the _Third Symphony_ and to the Finale of the _Eighth_.    We now present a tabular view of the Sonata-Form summing up the  features just commented upon.

I had some shoes, to keep the thorns  outa my feet, and I had rawhide leggin's. We just had such clothes as we  could get, old patched-up clothes. They just had that jeans cloth,  homemade clothes.    \"I was with George Reedes 10 or 12 years. It was my first trainin'  learnin' the stock business and horse breakin.' He was tol'able good to  us, to be slaves as we was. His brother had a hired man that whipped me  once, with a quirt. I've heard my father and mother tell how they  whipped 'em. They'd tie 'em down on a log or up to a post and whip 'em  till the blisters rose, then take a paddle and open 'em up and pour salt  in 'em. Yes'm, they whipped the women. The most I remember about that,  my father and sister was in the barn shuckin' co'n and the master come  in there and whipped my sister with a cowhide whip. My father caught a  lick in the face and he told the master to keep his whip offen him. So  the master started on my father and he run away. When he finally come in  he was so wild his master had to call him to get orders for work, and  finally the boss shot at him, but they didn't whip him any more. Of  course, some of 'em whipped with more mercy. They had a whippin' post  and when they strapped 'em down on a log they called it a 'stroppin'  log.'    \"I remember they tasked the cotton pickers in Mississippi. They had to  bring in so many pounds in the evenin' and if they didn't they got a  whippin' for it. My sister there, she had to bring in 900 pounds a day.  Well, cotton was heavier there. Most any of 'em could pick 900 pounds.  It was heavier and fluffier. We left the cotton country in Mississippi,  but nobody knew anything about cotton out here that I knew of.    \"I've heard my parents say too, them men that had plantations and a  great lot of slaves, they would speculate with 'em and would have a  chain that run from the front ones to the back ones. Sometimes they  would have 15 or 20 miles to make to get them to the sale place, but  they couldn't make a break. Where they expected to make a sale, they  kept 'em in corrals and they had a block there to put 'em up on and bid  'em off. The average price was about $500, but some that had good  practice, like a blacksmith, brought a good price, as high as $1,500.    \"I heard my mother and father say they would go 15 or 20 miles to a  dance, walkin', and get back before daylight, before the 'padderollers'  got 'em. The slaves would go off when they had no permission and them  that would ketch 'em and whip 'em was the 'padderollers.' Sometimes they  would have an awful race.    \"If they happened to be a slave on the plantation that could jes' read a  little print, they would get rid of him right now. He would ruin the  niggers, they would get too smart. The' was no such thing as school here  for culluds in early days. The white folks we was raised up with had  pretty good education. That's why I don't talk like most cullud folks. I  was about grown and the' was an English family settled close, about half  a mile, I guess. They had a little boy, his name was Arthur Ederle, and  he come over and learned me how to spell 'cat' and 'dog' and 'hen' and  such like. I was right around about 20 years old. I couldn't sign my  name when I was 18 years old.    \"I can remember one time when I was young, I saw something I couldn't  'magine what it was, like a billygoat reared up on a tree. But I knew  the' wasn't a billygoat round there near, nor no other kinds of goats.  It was in the daytime and I was out in a horse pasture, I was jes'  walkin' along, huntin', when I saw that sight. I guess I got within 50  steps of it, then I turned around and got away. I never did think much  about a ghost, but I think it could be possible.    \"I don't remember scarcely anything about the war because I was so  little and times was so different; the country wasn't settled up and  everything was wild, no people, hardly. Of course, my life was in the  woods, you might say, didn't hardly know when Sunday come.    \"The northern soldiers never did get down in here that I know of. I know  once, when they was enlisting men to go to battle a whole lot of 'em  didn't want to fight and would run away and dodge out, and they would  follow 'em and try to make 'em fight. They had a battle up here on the  Nueces once and killed some of 'em. I know my boss was in the bunch that  followed 'em and he got scared for fear this old case would be brought  up after the war. The company that followed these men was called Old  Duff Company. I think somewhere around 40 was in the bunch that they  followed, but I don't know how many was killed. They was a big bluff and  a big water hole and they said they was throwed in that big water hole.    \"We had possums and 'coons to eat sometimes. My father, he gen'rally  cooked the 'coons, he would dress 'em and stew 'em and then bake 'em. My  mother wouldn't eat them. There was plenty of rabbits, too. Sometimes  when they had potatoes they cooked 'em with 'em. I remember one time  they had just a little patch of blackhead sugar cane. After the freedom,  my mother had a kind of garden and she planted snap beans and  watermelons pretty much every year.    \"The master fed us tol'bly well. Everything was wild, beef was free,  just had to bring one in and kill it. Once in awhile, of a Sunday  mornin', we'd get biscuit flour bread to eat. It was a treat to us. They  measured the flour out and it had to pan out just like they measured. He  give us a little somethin' ever' Christmas and somethin' good to eat. I  heard my people say coffee was high, at times, and I know we didn't get  no flour, only Sunday mornin'. We lived on co'nbread, mostly, and beef  and game outta the woods. That was durin' the war and after the war,  too.    \"I was around about 6 or 7 years old when we was freed. We worked for  George Reedes awhile, then drifted on down to the Frio river and stayed  there about a year, then we come to Medina County and settled here close  to where I was raised. We didn't think it hard times at all right after  the war. The country was wild and unsettled, with ranches 15 or 20 miles  apart. You never did see anybody and we didn't know really what was  goin' on in the rest of the country. Sometimes something could happen in  5 miles of us and we didn't know it for a month.    \"I was on the Adams Ranch on the Hondo when my master come out and told  us we were as free as he was. He said we could stay on and work or could  go if we wanted to. He gave my mother and father 50 cents apiece and 25  cents for the children. We stayed awhile and then went west to the Frio.    \"I used to be along with old man Big-foot Wallace in my early days. He  was a mighty fine man. I worked for the people that was gathering stock  together there. Big Foot raised nice horses, old reg'lar Texas horses,  and they was better than the reg'lar old Spanish bronco. I used to go to  his camp down on the San Miguel. He lived in one part and his chickens  in the rest of his house. His friends liked to hear him talk about his  travels. He used to run stock horses and had a figger 7 on the left  shoulder for his brand and the tip of each ear split was his earmark.    \"The last man I broke horses for was Wilson Bailey. I was there about 12  years. He raised just cavi-yard--we called it a cavi-yard of horses,  just the same thing as a _remuda_. We called 'em that later, but we got  that from the Spanish. We would get up in a tree with our loop till the  horse come under and drop it down on him. When they were so spoilt, we  got 'em in a sort of cavi-yard and drove 'em under trees and caught 'em  in a snare. We had lots of wild horses, just this side of Pearsall.  'Bout the only way I'd get throwed was to get careless. We'd ketch 'im  up, hackamore 'im up, saddle 'im up and get on 'im and let 'im go.  Sometimes he'd be too wild to pitch, he'd break and run and you had to  let 'im run himself down. I used to rather ketch up a wild horse and  break 'im than to eat breakfast.    \"When I first started farmin' I taken up some state land, about 80  acres, down on Black Creek, in Medina County. I stayed there ten or  twelve years. Cotton hadn't got in this country and I raised some corn,  sugar cane and watermelons. I commenced with horses, but 'long 'way down  the line I used oxen some, too. I used one of those old walking plows.    \"I sold that place and moved to a place on the Tywaukney Creek  (Tonkawa). I come up to church and met my wife then. Her name was Ida  Bradley and I was 38 years old. We lived down on the Tywaukney right  about 23 years and raised our children there. We jes' had a little home  weddin'. I wore a suit, dark suit. We got married about 8 o'clock in the  evenin' and we had barbecue, cake and ice cream. You see, in them times  I wasn't taught anything about years and dates, but I judge it was about  25 years after the war before I settled on the Tywaukney.\"          420310           GUS BRADSHAW was born about 1845, at Keecheye, Alabama, a slave of       David Cavin. He recalls being brought to Texas in the 1850's, when       the Cavin family settled near old Port Caddo. Gus remained with his       master for ten years after emancipation. He now lives alone on a       fifty acre farm seven miles northeast of Marshall, which he bought       in 1877. Gus receives an $11.00 per month pension.      \"I was born at Keecheye, Alabama, and belonged to old man David Cavin.  The only statement I can make 'bout my age is I knows I was 'bout twenty  years old when us slaves was freed. I never knowed my daddy, but my  mammy was Amelia Cavin. I's heard her say she's born in Alabama more  times than I got fingers and toes. Our old master brung us to Texas when  I's a good sized kid.
