charity. So the imprecations of David were accomplished on  his own family instead of Joab's. (10)      THE MARRIAGE OF SOLOMON    The next to suffer Joab's fate was Shimei ben Gera, whose  treatment of David had outraged every feeling of decency. His  death was of evil portent for Solomon himself. So long as Shimei,  who was Solomon's teacher, was alive, he did not venture to marry  the daughter of Pharaoh. When, after Shimei's death, Solomon  took her to wife, the archangel Gabriel descended from heaven,  and inserted a reed in the sea. About this reed more and more earth  was gradually deposited, and, on the day on which Jeroboam  erected the golden calves, a little hut was built upon the island.  This was the first of the dwelling-places of Rome. (11)    Solomon's wedding-feast in celebration of his marriage with the  Egyptian princess came on the same day as the consecration of the  Temple. (12) The rejoicing over the king's marriage was greater  than over the completion of the Temple. As the proverb has it: \"All  pay flattery to a king.\" Then it was that God conceived the plan of  destroying Jerusalem. It was as the prophet spoke: \"This city hath  been to me a provocation of mine anger and of my fury from the  day that they built it even unto this day.\"    In the nuptial night Pharaoh's daughter had her attendants play  upon a thousand different musical instruments, which she had  brought with her from her home, and as each was used, the name  of the idol to which it was dedicated was mentioned aloud. The  better to hold the king under the spell of her charms, she spread  above his bed a tapestry cover studded with diamonds and pearls,  which gleamed and glittered like constellations in the sky.  Whenever Solomon wanted to rise, he saw these stars, and  thinking it was night still, he slept on until the fourth hour of the  morning. The people were plunged in grief, for the daily sacrifice  could not be brought on this very morning of the Temple  dedication, because the Temple keys lay under Solomon's pillow,  and none dared awaken him. Word was sent to Bath-sheba, who  forthwith aroused her son, and rebuked him for his sloth. \"Thy  father,\" she said, \"was known to all as a God-fearing man, and now  people will say, 'Solomon is the son of Bath-sheba, it is his  mother's fault if he goes wrong.' Whenever thy father's wives were  pregnant, they offered vows and prayed that a son worthy to reign  might be born unto them. But my prayer was for a learned son  worthy of the gift of prophecy. Take care, 'give not thy strength  unto women nor thy ways to them that destroy kings,' for  licentiousness confounds the reason of man. Keep well in mind the  things that are necessary in the life of a king. (13) 'Not kings,  Lemuel.' Have naught in common with kings who say: 'What need  have we of a God?' It is not meet that thou shouldst do like the  kings who drink wine and live in lewdness. Be not like unto them.  He to whom the secrets of the world are revealed, (14) should not  intoxicate himself with wine.\" (15)    Apart from having married a Gentile, whose conversion to  Judaism was not dictated by pure motives, Solomon transgressed  two other Biblical laws. He kept many horses, which a Jewish king  ought not to do, and, what the law holds in equal abhorrence, he  amassed much silver and gold. Under Solomon's rule silver and  gold were so abundant among the people that their utensils were  made of them instead of the baser metals. (16) For all this he had  to atone painfully later on.      HIS WISDOM    But Solomon's wealth and pomp were as naught in comparison  with his wisdom. When God appeared to him in Gibeon, in a  dream by night, and gave him leave to ask what he would,   a grace  accorded to none beside except King Ahaz of Judah, and promised  only to the Messiah in time to come, (17)   Solomon chose  wisdom, knowing that wisdom once in his possession, all else  would come of itself. (18) His wisdom, the Scriptures testify, was  greater than the wisdom of Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and  Calcol, and Darda, the three sons of Mahol. This means that he  was wiser than Abraham, (19) Moses, (20) Joseph, (21) and the  generation of the desert. (22) He excelled even Adam. (23) His  proverbs which have come down to us are barely eight hundred in  number. Nevertheless the Scripture counts them equal to three  thousand, for the reason that each verse in his book admits of a  double and a triple interpretation. In his wisdom he analyzed the  laws revealed to Moses, and he assigned reasons for the ritual and  ceremonial ordinances of the Torah, which without his explanation  had seemed strange. (24) The \"forty-nine gates of wisdom\" were  open to Solomon as they had been to Moses, but the wise king  sought to outdo even the wise legislator. He had such confidence  in himself that he would have dispensed judgment without resort  to witnesses, had he not been prevented by a heavenly voice. (25)    The first proof of his wisdom was given in his verdict in the case  of the child claimed by two mothers as their own. When the  women presented their difficulty, the king said that God in His  wisdom had foreseen that such a quarrel would arise, and therefore  had created the organs of man in pairs, so that neither of the two  parties to the dispute might be wronged. on hearing these words  from the king, Solomon's counsellors lamented: \"Woe to thee, O  land, when thy king is a youth.\" In a little while they realized the  wisdom of the king, and then they exclaimed: \"Happy art thou, O  land, when thy king is a free man.\" The quarrel had of set purpose  been brought on by God to the end that Solomon's wisdom might  be made known. In reality the two litigants were not women at all,  but spirits. That all doubt about the fairness of the verdict might be  dispelled, a heavenly voice proclaimed: \"This is the mother of the  child.\" (26)    During the lifetime of David, when Solomon was still a lad, he had  settled another difficult case in an equally brilliant way. A wealthy  man had sent his son on a protracted business trip to Africa. On his  return he found that his father had died in the meantime, and his  treasures had passed into the possession of a crafty slave, who had  succeeded in ridding himself of all the other slaves, or intimidating  them. In vain the rightful heir urged his claim before King David.  As he could not bring witnesses to testify for him, there was no  way of dispossessing the slave, who likewise called himself the  son of the deceased. The child Solomon heard the case, and he  devised a method of arriving at the truth. He had the father's corpse  exhumed, and he dyed one of the bones with the blood first of one  of the claimants, and then of the other. The blood of the slave  showed no affinity with the bone, while the blood of the true heir  permeated it. So the real son secured his inheritance. (27)    After his accession to the throne, a peculiar quarrel among heirs  was brought before Solomon for adjudication. Asmodeus, the king  of demons, once said to Solomon: \"Thou art the wisest of men, yet  I shall show thee something thou hast never seen.\" Thereupon  Asmodeus stuck his finger in the ground, and up came a  double-headed man. He was one of the Cainites, who live  underground, and are altogether different in nature and habit from  the denizens of the upper world. (28) When the Cainite wanted to  descend to his dwelling-place again, it appeared that he could not  return thither. Not even Asmodeus could bring the thing about. So  he remained on earth, took unto himself a wife, and begot seven  sons, one of whom resembled his father in having two heads.  When the Cainite died, a dispute broke out among his descendants  as to how the property was to be divided. The double-headed son  claimed two portions.

I should like you to help me decide a suit  which the king of Rome has submitted to me. In the Roman  kingdom there lived a maiden and a youth, who promised each  other under oath never to enter into a marriage without obtaining  each other's permission. The parents of the girl betrothed their  daughter to a man whom she loved, but she refused to become his  wife until the companion of her youth gave his consent. She took  much gold and silver, and sought him out to bribe him.
