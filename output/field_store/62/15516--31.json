Lord Lewis of Spain, on the side of Charles of Blois, made a descent  upon Quimperle at the head of 6000 men, and pillaged the whole country. On  the news reaching Sir Walter Manny, he hastened to meet the enemy, took  possession of their fleet, and made such carnage of the soldiers, that  they were all killed or taken prisoners, and Lewis of Spain escaped with  difficulty. The country about Quimperle is beautiful--wood and water in  every direction. The department of Finistere is traversed by three hundred  streams, and has an extent of nearly four hundred miles of coast. We were  advised to go and see the rood-screen of the chapel of Rosgrand, but had  no time. We visited the ruins of the church of St. Columban. Above a  round-arched doorway is a beautiful flamboyant window, between two  canopied niches. We next walked up to the Place near St. Michel, where a  cattle-market was being held. The Breton peasants, with their long shaggy  uncombed hair hanging round their shoulders--they comb and wash only on  fete days--their dirty canvas bragou bras, patched coats, and sabots with  tufts of straw crammed in, looked more dirty than it is possible to  imagine. Cleanliness is the last of the Breton virtues. The market and the  fair are the two great events of the country, and people flock from great  distances to sell their merchandise. But of all extraordinary animals is  the Breton pig, as tall as a donkey; a lean, long-necked, ragged, bristly,  savage-looking beast, as ill kept as its master, and it runs like a  greyhound when approached. The Breton cow is very small, small as the  Kerry cows of Ireland, very pretty and very productive. The Breton butter  is proverbially good, and is given out most liberally, in lumps as big as  loaves, at the tables-d'hote. It is brought to market in jars which the  women carry upon their heads. It is to the Queen-Duchess that Brittany,  and indeed all France, owes the privilege of eating butter in Lent.  It  was forbidden as animal food by the laws of the Church, and oil, a  vegetable production, ordered as a substitute.  In 1491, Anne solicited of  Rome, for herself and household, permission to eat butter on fast-days,  alleging, as a plea, that Brittany did not produce oil. Encouraged by this  favour, Brittany obtained the same indulgence, and it was acquired  successively by the other provinces of France; but all are originally  indebted for the privilege to the good Queen-Duchess Anne.    Next day, leaving the department of Finistere, we entered that of  Morbihan, and went by rail to Lorient on the river Scorff, here joined by  the Blavet. It was formerly the seat of the French East India Company; it  is now one of the five military ports of France and the residence of a  maritime Prefect. In the Place Bisson is the statue of a young officer of  the French navy, a native of Guemene-sur-Scorff (Morbihan). When  commanding, in 1827, a brig in the Greek Archipelago, he was attacked by  two pirate vessels. Nine out of his fifteen men were killed and himself  wounded; the enemy crowded on the deck. Desiring the survivors of his crew  to jump overboard, \"Now,\" cried he to the pilot, \"is the moment for  revenge!\" and, setting fire to the powder-magazine, he blew up himself,  his ship, and the pirates who had boarded her. Next morning the bodies of  seventy Greeks lay on the sea-shore, showing the success of his  self-devotion. The pilot, who, with four sailors, was saved, received the  decoration of the Legion of Honour. On the pedestal of Bisson's statue is  an inscription, concluding with these words: \"Mort en heros, pour son roi  et sa patrie, ses amis le pleurent, la France le regrette, et ses freres  d'armes envient son sort.\"    From here we proceeded to Hennebont (Breton, \"old bridge\"), famous, in the  War of Succession, for its heroic defence by Jeanne de Flandre, during the  captivity of her husband, Jean de Montfort, who had been taken prisoner at  Nantes and carried off to Paris. Jeanne, who, as Froissart says, had the  courage of a man and the heart of a lion, placed herself at the head of  his party. Like another Maria Theresa, she presented herself before the  Breton lords, with her infant son in her arms, and received their oaths of  allegiance. She then joined in the defence of Hennebont, which was  invested by Charles of Blois. Clothed in armour and mounted on a  war-horse, she galloped up and down the streets, encouraging the  inhabitants. She ordered the ladies of her suite and other women of the  place to cut short their \"keytels,\" carry the stones to the ramparts, and  transport pots of quick-lime to throw down upon the enemy. At the head of  300 horsemen, the Countess, who rode better than any squire, sallied out  of the town, attacked and burnt the enemy's camp, retreated to Auray, and,  a few days after, re-entered Hennebont, with banners flying and trumpets  sounding. But the blockade was so close that provisions were wanting, and  the garrison compelled her to agree to a capitulation, unless within three  days assistance arrived from England. The time was on the point of  expiring, and a herald had approached the gate of the city to receive the  keys in the name of Charles of Blois, when the Countess, from her window,  perceived at sunrise the English fleet entering the port in full sail. She  exclaimed, \"We are saved!\" The siege was raised, and the Countess, says  Froissart, kissed Sir Walter Manny and all his companions, one after the  other, two or three times, like a noble and valiant dame. \"Better,\"  observed Charles, when he heard the news, \"that Jeanne, instead of her  lord, had been shut up in the Louvre.\" He left the carrying on of the  siege to Lewis of Spain, and proceeded to Vannes and Auray. Some fragments  of walls are all that remain of Jeanne de Montfort's castle, which was  situated on a height on the other side of the river in the \"Vieille  ville.\" The town on the left bank of the Blavet is called the \"Ville  neuve\" and the \"Ville close,\" being surrounded by walls. Large vessels  ascend the Blavet to Hennebont. It is traversed by a light and elegant  railway viaduct of twelve arches. We saw on the quay a quantity of red  iron-ore from Bilbao.    Hennebont is a very pretty town; the principal building is the church of  Notre Dame-de-Paradis, of the sixteenth century, with a fine square stone  tower, surmounted by a beautiful spire, and a tall porch, forming one side  of the tower. This handsome church has lately been restored. The scenery  about the Blavet is very pretty--the banks wooded, and fertile fields. We  took a boat and rowed up the river, passing the ruined Abbaye de la Joie,  where a hideous chateau has been built. This was a Cistercian convent,  founded in the thirteenth century by Blanche of Navarre, wife of Duke John  I. (_le Roux_). The chapel of Notre Dame-de-Paradis formerly belonged to  the convent; but when the parish church was demolished, the Abbey ceded  this chapel to the town, reserving the privilege of a separate seat for  the Abbess, who, on the Sunday after St. John's day, had her crosier  carried before her in state by one of her vassals at high mass and  vespers.    From Hennebont we went by rail to Auray, and established ourselves for  some time in the Pavillon d'en Haut, a most comfortable hotel. Auray is  situated on the slope of a hill, the streets narrow and steep.    Our first drive was to Ste. Anne d'Auray, one of the most famous places of  pilgrimage in Brittany, on account of its miraculous well and church. It  has been called the Mecca of Brittany. Here, according to the legend in  the seventeenth century, Ste. Anne appeared to a countryman, and directed  him to dig in a certain field, where he would find her image, and to build  a chapel there. Guided by a miraculous light, Nicolazic discovered the  statue, and erected a chapel on the site.    [Illustration: 33. Scala Sancta. Ste. Anne d'Auray.]    The spring where Ste. Anne first appeared is now enclosed in a large basin  of cut stone. Near it is the church, in course of reconstruction. It  stands in a court surrounded by covered galleries for the shelter of the  pilgrims. Two flights of steps, called the Scala Sancta (after that of St.  John Lateran), lead to a platform over the three entrance gates, upon  which is an altar surmounted by a cupola, where mass can be heard by  20,000 persons. The steps are ascended by the pilgrims barefooted, as they  do at Rome. The fete of Ste. Anne is celebrated on the 26th of July, when  pilgrims arrive from all parts of Brittany to visit the miraculous statue,  to ascend the holy staircase, and to drink or wash in the sacred fountain.  It was a fete day when we visited Ste. Anne. There was a large assemblage  of people, and booths were erected round the court, where were sold  rosaries and the wire brooches, with scarlet and blue tufts of worsted,  called _epinglettes_, worn by the Bretons in their hats as a token of  their having made a pilgrimage. We saw exhibited the photograph of a young  lady, said to have lately recovered from paralysis after bathing in the  holy well. So world-wide is the fame of Ste. Anne d'Auray that a traveller  mentions having seen at her shrine an embroidered altar-cloth of Irish  damask, with \"Irlande: Reconnaissance a Sainte Anne, 1850,\" woven into the  pattern. The convent, with its enclosure, the Scala Sancta, fountain, and  miraculous bush, all date from the seventeenth century. There is a railway  station for Ste. Anne, within two miles of the church.    Returning to Auray, we went to the Chartreuse, which owes its origin to  the chapel of Saint Michel-du-Champ founded (1382) by John de Montfort,  afterwards Duke John IV., on the spot where, in 1364, he gained the battle  of Auray, which obtained for him the duchy of Brittany. The chapel is  close to the railway station. In the fifteenth century it was given to the  Chartreux, and became a monastery of the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22716"],[0,"The Book-Hunter at Home (#20)"],[1," pays au monde, si comme je croy,  le plus remply des bas et joyeulx passetemps pour toutes gentilles  pucelles et jeunes bacheliers qui pretendent a honneur de  chevalerie.'[35]    The entire cycle of legends which has the Holy Grail for its centre is  concerned with Britain and Britain alone. Caerleon and Winchester,  Tintagel and Glastonbury, these are the chief stages in this great  romance of perfect knighthood; and whether related by a scribe of  Hainault in the thirteenth century or sung by a Welsh bard before the  Norman Conquest or praised at the court at Paris by the favourite  troubadour of Philip Augustus, it is all one as regards the setting and  the chief characters. 'Whether for goodly men or for chivalrous deeds,  for courtesy or for honour,' wrote the Norman chronicler Wace in the  middle of the twelfth century, 'in Arthur's day England bore the flower  from all the lands near by, yea from every other land whereof we know.  The poorest peasant in his smock was a more courteous and valiant  gentleman than was a belted knight beyond the sea.'    There is a pleasing story which relates how Robert Bruce, marching with  his army in the mountains of Ireland, heard a woman crying during one of  the halts. He inquired immediately what was the matter, and was told that  it was a camp-follower, a poor laundress, who was taken in child-bed; and  as it was impossible to take her with them, she bemoaned her fate in  being left behind to die. The king replied that he is no man who will not  pity a woman then. He ordered that a tent should be pitched for her  immediately, and that she should be attended at once by the other women;  and there he tarried his host until she had been delivered and could be  carried along with them. 'This,' says the Chronicler, 'was a full great  courtesy.' Chivalry? In the very highest sense of the word.    We must be careful lest, losing sight of the many attributes of chivalry,  we incline towards the erroneous view that it was confined entirely to  the upper classes. That the manuscript volumes of the romantic tales  which were so eagerly purchased and treasured by the educated classes  could never possibly come into the hands of the rude illiterate peasants  is a fallacious argument. Scanty indeed would be our folk-lore had it all  been transmitted graphically. Chaucer bears evidence of the widespread  popularity of these heroic tales in his day:        'Alexaundres storie is so commune       That every wight that hath discrecioune       Hath herde somewhat or al of his fortune.'    The incidents of these immortal tales were as well known to the humblest  as to the highest in the land. We have abundant evidence of their  popularity when recounted in front of the fire in hostel or homestead.  Even so late as Milton's day it was the custom to recount knightly  adventures and fairy tales about the evening fireside. When                        the live-long daylight fail      Then to the Spicy Nut-brown Ale,      With stories told of many a feat,      How _Faery Mab_ the junkets eat,      .       .       .       .       .       .      Where throngs of Knights and Barons bold,      In weeds of Peace high triumphs hold,      With store of Ladies, whose bright eyes      Rain influence, and judge the prise,    until at length        Thus done the Tales, to bed they creep,      By whispering Winds soon lull'd asleep.    How great a part of the pleasures of this world have they missed whose  pulses are never stirred by the Spirit of Romance! Content and Peace of  Mind may be had by all who will offer up sacrifices to obtain them; but  Imagination is not to be had at any price unless it be a part of our  birthright. Content may yield a tranquillity of mind that refreshes the  soul, but it is Imagination alone that can produce that spiritual  exaltation which takes our minds from worldly things, carries us  backwards or forwards through countless ages of the past or aeons of  futurity, and enables us to ride in the chariot of Phoebus. It is a  vast library in itself.        'He had small need of books; for many a tale       Traditionary round the mountains hung,       And many a legend, peopling the dark woods,       Nourished Imagination in her growth.'    It was the fortune of our book-hunter once to spend an afternoon in June  upon the downs near Winchester. To southward of the old town there is a  deep grassy hollow, crescent-shaped, its southern slope fringed with  wood; and here in the shade he lay reading the 'Morte d'Arthur' of old  Malory. Coming at length to the Noble Tale of the Sangreal, he read how  King Arthur, having come 'unto Camelot by the houre of undorn on  Whytsonday,' and feasting with the fellowship of the Round Table, was  told of the marvel wrought unto Balin's sword by Merlin.    You will remember that Balin fought unbeknown with his brother Balan,  that each wounded the other unto death, and that they were buried by  Merlin in the same tomb. Then Merlin 'lete make by his subtylyte that  Balyn's swerd was put in a marbel stone standyng up ryght as grete as a  mylle stone, and the stone hoved alweyes above the water, and dyd many  yeres, and so by adventure it swam doun the streme to the Cyte of Camelot  that is in Englysshe Wynchestre.'    To the west the downs slope steeply into the river valley, and set in the  rich green meadows like a skein of silver threads the book-hunter could  discern the Itchen with its attendant rivulets. So he gazed across to the  stream and pondered over this marvellous stone which 'hoved' always above  the water, a sword set in it so that the pommel alone could be seen, 'and  in the pomel therof were precyous stones wrought with subtyle letters of  gold.' It was the symbol which was to prove the youthful Galahad the  _haut prince_ who should achieve the Sangreal.    That same evening, wandering along the river's bank below the city, his  head full of the wondrous tale, an adventure befell him. It was dusk, and  he had crossed the stream at a ford, when suddenly he saw the stone. It  was lying upon its side, not a dozen paces from the water. There was no  doubt whatever about it. It was roughly five feet long, about half as  wide and thick, and of a curious reddish-brown--the colour of dried  blood.    'Sir,' said the squire who brought the news to the King and his Knights,  'there is here bynethe at the Ryver a grete stone which I saw flete above  the water, and therin I sawe styckyng a swerd. The Kynge sayde, I wille  see that marveill. Soo all the Knyghtes went with hym. And whanne they  came unto the ryver they fonde there a stone fletyng, _as hit were of  reed marbel_, and therin stack a fair ryche swerd.'    I confess that not a little awe was mingled with delight as our  book-hunter gazed upon the stone, walked round it, touched it! Then  suddenly away in the old city a bell tolled, and he recollected that it  was Whitsun Eve! That walk home in the twilight was something not easily  to be forgotten, and neither supper nor a pipe could bring him back to  earth and the twentieth century again. Next morning he was up early,  anxious to see if any trace were left of the spot where this marvel had  occurred, for it was scarcely possible that the whole adventure was other  than a dream. But the spot was soon found, and sure enough there was the  stone or peron,[36] and he could examine it in the sunshine at his  leisure. How it got there or whence it came it were impossible to guess;  the chalk for miles around contains nothing but flints, and the peron was  smooth and polished 'as a mill-stone.'    [Illustration: THE PERON]    That Winchester is not Camelot antiquaries have told us often enough. The  city of the Knights may have been in the West Country or in Wales for  aught our bookman cares; but until they can produce a likelier site and a  better peron he will continue to take Sir Thomas's word for it.    One other point. I have said that the stone lay some few paces from the  water. You will notice when you pay a pilgrimage to the stone (it lies at  the ford, hard by a church) that the ground about it is almost level with  the water, so that when the river is in flood the stone must be almost  submerged: in other words, it would then _hove above the water_. It is  easy to see from the bank on the other side that the river has changed  its course by a few yards, leaving the stone now high and dry. If you  dispute this, why then I can only say that the stone, as 'by adventure it  swam down the stream,' must have been cast there by the river when in  flood. That there is a cleft in the stone whence Galahad withdrew the  sword I can neither affirm nor deny; it _may_ have closed up, for with  perons of this nature all things are possible, or the stone itself _may_  have got turned over.[37] At all events I for one shall not be so rash as  to cast suspicion upon so historic a relic.    For those materialists who doubt that such an event ever took place, I  will propound a theory. That the first twelve books of the 'Morte  d'Arthur' were translated from the French by Sir Thomas Malory seems  probable. Caxton says as much in his Preface, and the Epilogue to Book  XII. reads, 'Here endeth the second book of Syr Tristram that was drawen  oute of Frensshe in to Englysshe. But here is no rehersal of the thyrd  book. And here foloweth the noble tale of the Sancgreal that called is  the hooly vessel.' It has been shown[38] that the stories of the Holy  Grail are probably of Welsh origin, and--Sir Thomas is said to have been  a Welshman. Is it possible that he was ever at Winchester, that he  wandered on Whitsun Eve (as did our book-hunter) along the Itchen, that  he came to and roused over the stone (smooth and polished as a  mill-stone), so different from any to be seen hereabout, and that as he  wandered back to Camelot he wove the delicious romance about it? At all  events, if he were ever there, it is at least possible that the"]]]
