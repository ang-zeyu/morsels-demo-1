[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2391"],[0,"Bruce (#20)"],[1,"that day that he had  overstepped the spirit of his own orders from the division commander.    In brief, he had made no effort to \"dress\" his command, in the advance,  upon the regiments to either side of it. As a result, when the signal  to bivouac for the night was given, the \"Here-We-Comes\" were something  like a mile ahead of the regiment which should have been at their  immediate right, and nearly two miles in front of the brigade at their  left.    In other words, the \"Here-We-Comes\" now occupied a salient of their  own, ahead of the rest of the FrancoAmerican line. It was in rebuke for  this bit of good progress and bad tactics that the division commander  had written to the colonel, in the dispatch which Bruce had brought.    German airmen, sailing far above, and dodging as best they could the  charges of the Allied 'planes, had just noted that the \"Here-We-Comes\"  \"salient\" was really no salient at all. So far had it advanced that,  for the moment, it was out of touch with the rest of the division. It  was, indeed, in an excellent position to be cut off and demolished by a  dashing nightattack. And a report to this effect was delivered to a  fumingly distracted German major general, who yearned for a chance to  atone in some way for the day's shameful reverses.    \"If they hadn't halted us and made us call it a day, just as we were  getting into our stride,\" loudly grumbled one Yankee private to another  as the two clumped up to the kitchen, \"we'd have been in  Fere-en-Tardenois by now. What lazy guy is running this drive, anyhow?\"    \"The same lazy guy that will stick you into the hoosgow for  insubordination and leave you to do your bit there while the rest of us  stroll on to Berlin!\" snapped Top-Sergeant Mahan, wheeling upon the  grumbler. \"Till you learn how to obey orders without grouching, it  isn't up to you to knock wiser men. Shut up!\"    Though Mahan's tone of reproof was professionally harsh, his spirit was  not in his words. And the silenced private knew it. He knew, too, that  the top-sergeant was as savage over the early halt as were the rest of  the men.    Bruce, as a rule, when he honored the \"Here-We-Comes\" with a visit,  spent the bulk of his time with Mahan and old Vivier. But to-day  neither of these friends was an inspiring companion. Nor were the rest  of Bruce's acquaintances disposed to friendliness. Wherefore, as soon  as supper was eaten, the dog returned to his heap of bedding, for the  hour or so of laziness which Nature teaches all her children to demand,  after a full meal,--and which the so-called \"dumb\" animals alone are  intelligent enough to take.    Dusk had merged into night when Bruce got to his feet again. Taps had  just sounded. The tired men gladly rolled themselves into their  blankets and fell into a dead sleep. A sentry-relief set forth to  replace the first batch of sentinels with the second.    Mahan was of the party. Though the top-sergeant had been a stupid  comrade, thus far to-day, he was now evidently going for a walk. And  even though it was a duty-walk, yet the idea of it appealed to the dog  after his long inaction.    So Bruce got up and followed. As he came alongside the stiffly marching  top-sergeant, the collie so far subverted discipline as to thrust his  nose, in friendly greeting, into Mahan's slightly cupped palm. And the  top-sergeant so far abetted the breach of discipline as to give the  collie's head a furtive pat. The night was dim, as the moon had not  risen; so the mutual contact of good-fellowship was not visible to the  marching men on either side of Mahan and the dog. And discipline,  therefore, did not suffer much, after all.    At one post after another, a sentinel was relieved and a fresh man took  his place. Farthest in front of the \"Here-We-Comes\" lines--and nearest  to the German--was posted a lanky Missourian whom Bruce liked, a man  who had a way of discovering in his deep pockets stray bits of food  which he had hoarded there for the collie and delighted to dole out to  him. The Missourian had a drawlingly soft voice the dog liked, and he  used to talk to Bruce as if the latter were another human.    For all these reasons--and because Mahan was too busy and too grumpy to  bother with him--Bruce elected to stay where he was, for a while, and  share the Missourian's vigil. So, when the rest of the party moved  along to the next sentry-go, the dog remained. The Missourian was only  too glad to have him do so. It is tedious and stupid to pace a desolate  beat, alone, at dead of night, after a day of hard fighting. And the  man welcomed the companionship of the dog.    For a time, as the Missourian paced his solitary stretch of broken and  shrub-grown ground, Bruce gravely paced to and fro at his side. But  presently this aimless promenade began to wax uninteresting. And, as  the two came to the far end of the beat, Bruce yawned and lay down. It  was pleasanter to lie there and to watch the sentinel do the walking.    Stretched out, in a little grass-hollow, the dog followed blinkingly  with his soft brown eyes the pendulumlike progress of his friend. And  always the dog's plumed tail would beat rhythmic welcome against the  ground as the sentry approached him.    Thus nearly an hour wore on. A fat moon butted its lazy way through the  smoke-mists of the eastern skyline.    Then something happened--something that Bruce could readily have  forestalled if the wind had been blowing from the other direction, and  if a dog's eyes were not as nearsighted as his nose is farsmelling.    The Missourian paused to run his hand caressingly over the collie's  rough mane, and moved on, down the lonely beat. Bruce watched his  receding figure, drowsily. At the end of ninety yards or more, the  Missourian passed by a bunch of low bushes which grew at the near side  of a stretch of hilly and shellpocked ground. He moved past the bushes,  still watched by the somewhat bored dog.    It was then that Bruce saw a patch of bushshadow detach itself from the  rest, under the glow of the rising moon. The shadow was humpy and  squat. Noiseless, it glided out from among the bushes, close at the  sentry's heels, and crept after him.    Bruce pricked his ears and started to get up. His curiosity was roused.  The direction of the wind prevented him from smelling out the nature of  the mystery. It also kept his keen hearing from supplying any clue. And  the distance would not permit him to see with any distinctness.    Still his curiosity was very mild. Surely, if danger threatened, the  sentinel would realize it. For by this time the Shadow was a bare three  feet behind him near enough, by Bruce's system of logic, for the  Missourian to have smelled and heard the pursuer. So Bruce got up, in  the most leisurely fashion, preparatory to strolling across to  investigate. But at almost his first step he saw something that changed  his gracefully slouching walk into a charging run.    The Shadow suddenly had merged with the sentinel. For an instant, in  stark silence, the two seemed to cling together. Then the Shadow fled,  and the lanky Missourian slumped to the earth in a sprawling heap, his  throat cut.    The slayer had been a deft hand at the job. No sound had escaped the  Missourian, from the moment the stranglingly tight left arm had been  thrown around his throat from behind until, a second later, he fell  bleeding and lifeless.    In twenty leaping strides, Bruce came up to the slain sentinel and bent  over him. Dog-instinct told the collie his friend had been done to  death. And the dog's power of scent told him it was a German who had  done the killing.    For many months, Bruce had been familiar with the scent of German  soldiers, so different from that of the army in which he toiled. And he  had learned to hate it, even as a dog hates the vague \"crushed  cucumber\" smell of a pitviper. But while every dog dreads the  viper-smell as much as he loathes it, Bruce had no fear at all of the  boche odor. Instead, it always awoke in him a blood-lust, as fierce as  any that had burned in his wolf-ancestors.    This same fury swept him now, as he stood, quivering, above the body of  the kindly man who so lately had petted him; this and a craving to  revenge the murder of his human friend.    For the briefest time, Bruce stood there, his dark eyes abrim with  unhappiness and bewilderment, as he gazed down on the huddled form in  the wet grass. Then an electric change came over him. The softness fled  from his eyes, leaving them bloodshot and blazing. His great tawny ruff  bristled like an angry cat's. The lazy gracefulness departed from his  mighty body. It became tense and terrible. In the growing moonlight his  teeth gleamed whitely from under his upcurled lip.    In a flash he turned and set off at a loping run, nose close to ground,  his long stride deceptively swift. The zest of the man-hunt had  obsessed him, as completely as, that day, it had spurred the advance of  the \"Here-We-Comes.\"    The trail of the slayer was fresh, even over such broken ground. Fast  as the German had fled, Bruce was flying faster. Despite the murderer's  long start, the dog speedily cut down the distance between his quarry  and himself. Not trusting to sight, but solely to his unerring sense of  smell. Bruce sped on.    Then, in a moment or two, his hearing re-enforced his scent. He could  catch the pad-pad-pad of running feet. And the increasing of the sound  told him he was gaining fast.    But in another bound his ears told him something else--something he  would have heard much sooner, had not the night wind been setting so  strongly in the other direction. He heard not only the pounding of his  prey's heavy-shod feet, but the soft thud of hundreds--perhaps  thousands--of other army shoes. And now, despite the adverse wind, the  odor of innumerable soldiers came to his fiercely sniffing nostrils.  Not only was it the scent of soldiers, but of German soldiers.    For "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2392"],[0,"Further Adventures of Lad (#20)"],[1,"him. So she asked leave of the Mistress  and the Master,--one of whom was her distant relative,--for the  convalescent to stay at the Place during his parents' absence.    That was how it all started.    The youngster was eleven years old; lank and gangling, and blest with a  fretful voice and with far less discipline and manners than a  three-month collie pup. His name was Cyril. Briefly, he was a pest,--an  unspeakable pest.    For the first day or two at the Place, the newness of his surroundings  kept Cyril more or less in bounds. Then, as homesickness and novelty  alike wore off, his adventurous soul expanded.    He was very much at home; far more so than were his hosts, and  infinitely more pleased than they with the situation in general. He had  an infinite genius for getting into trouble. Not in the delightfully  normal fashion of the average growing boy; but in furtively crafty ways  that did not belong to healthy childhood.    Day by day, Cyril impressed his odd personality more and more on  everything around him. The atmosphere of sweet peace which had brooded,  like a blessing, over the whole Place, was dispersed.    The cook,--a marvel of culinary skill and of long service, gave tearful  warning, and departed. This when she found the insides of all her  cooking utensils neatly soaped; and the sheaf of home-letters in her  work-box replaced by cigar-coupons.    One of the workmen threw over his job with noisy blasphemy; when his  room above the stables was invaded by stealth and a comic-paper picture  of a goat's head substituted for his dead mother's photograph in the  well-polished little bronze frame on his bureau.    And so on, all along the line.    The worst and most continuous sufferer from Cyril's loathed presence on  the Place was the massive collie, Lad.    The child learned, on the first day of his visit, that it would be  well-nigh as safe to play with a handful of dynamite as with Lad's  gold-and-white mate, Lady. Lady did not care for liberties from anyone.  And she took no pains to mask her snappish first-sight aversion to the  lanky Cyril. Her fiery little son, Wolf, was scarce less formidable  than she, when it came to being teased by an outsider. But gallant old  Lad was safe game.    He was safe game for Cyril, because Lad's mighty heart and soul were  miles above the possibility of resenting anything from so pitifully  weak and defenseless a creature as this child. He seemed to realize, at  a glance, that Cyril was an invalid and helpless and at a physical  disadvantage. And, as ever toward the feeble, his big nature went out  in friendly protection to this gangling wisp of impishness.    Which was all the good it did him.    In fact, it laid the huge collie open to an endless succession of  torment. For the dog's size and patience seemed to awaken every atom of  bullying cruelty in the small visitor's nature.    Cyril, from the hour of his arrival, found acute bliss in making Lad's  life a horror. His initial step was to respond effusively to the  collie's welcoming advances; so long as the Mistress and the Master  chanced to be in the room. As they passed out, the Mistress chanced to  look back.    She saw Cyril pull a bit of cake from his pocket and, with his left  hand, proffer it to Lad. The tawny dog stepped courteously forward to  accept the gift. As his teeth were about to close daintily on the cake,  Cyril whipped it back out of reach; and with his other hand rapped Lad  smartly across the nose.    Had any grown man ventured a humiliating and painful trick of that sort  on Lad, the collie would have been at the tormentor's throat, on the  instant. But it was not in the great dog's nature to attack a child.  Shrinking back, in amaze, his abnormally sensitive feelings jarred, the  collie retreated majestically to his beloved \"cave\" under the  music-room piano.    To the Mistress's remonstrance, Cyril denied most earnestly that he had  done the thing. Nor was his vehemently tearful denial shaken by her  assertion that she had seen it all.    Lad soon forgave the affront. And he forgave a dozen other and worse  mal-treatments which followed. But, at last, the dog took to shunning  the neighborhood of the pest. That availed him nothing; except to make  Cyril seek him out in whatsoever refuge the dog had chosen.    Lad, trotting hungrily to his dinner dish, would find his food  thick-strewn with cayenne pepper or else soaked in reeking gasoline.    Lad, seeking peace and solitude in his piano cave, would discover his  rug, there, cleverly scattered with carpet tacks, points upward.    Lad, starting up from a snooze at the Mistress's call, would be deftly  tripped as he started to bound down the veranda steps, and would risk  bruises and fractures by an ugly fall to the driveway below.    Wherever Lad went, whatever Lad did, there was a cruel trick awaiting  him. And, in time, the dog's dark eyes took on an expression of puzzled  unhappiness that went straight to the hearts of the two humans who  loved him.    All his life, Lad had been a privileged character on the Place. Never  had he known nor needed whip or chain. Never had he,--or any of the  Place's other dogs,--been wantonly teased by any human. He had known,  and had given, only love and square treatment and stanch friendliness.  He had ruled as benevolent monarch of the Place's Little People; had  given loyal service to his two deities, the Mistress and the Master;  and had stood courteously aloof from the rest of mankind. And he had  been very, very happy.    Now, in a breath, all this was changed. Ever at his heels, ever waiting  to find some new way to pester him, was a human too small and too weak  to attack;--a human who was forever setting the collie's high-strung  nerves on edge or else actively hurting him. Lad could not understand  it. And as the child gained in health and strength, Lad's lot grew  increasingly miserable.    The Mistress and the Master were keenly aware of conditions. And they  did their best,--a useless best,--to mitigate them for the dog. They  labored over Cyril, to make him leave Lad alone. They pointed out to  him the mean cowardice of his course of torture. They even threatened  to send him to nearer relatives until his parents' return. All in vain.  Faced with the most undeniable proofs, the child invariably would lie.  He denied that he had ever ill-used Lad in any way; and would weep, in  righteous indignation, at the charges. What was to be done?    \"I thought it would brighten up the house so, to have a child in it  again!\" sighed the Mistress as she and her husband discussed the  matter, uselessly, for the fiftieth time, after one of these scenes. \"I  looked forward so much to his coming here! But he's--oh, he isn't like  any child I ever heard of before!\"    \"If I could devote five busy minutes a day to him,\" grunted the Master,  \"with an axe-handle or perhaps a bale-stick--\"    \"You wouldn't do it!\" denied his wife. \"You wouldn't harm him; any more  than Lad does. That's the trouble. If Cyril belonged to us, we could  punish him. Not with a--a balestick, of course. But he needs a good  wholesome spanking, more than anyone else I can think of. That or some  other kind of punishment that would make an impression on him. But what  can we do? He isn't ours--\"    \"Thank God!\" interpolated the Master, piously.    \"And we can't punish other people's child,\" she finished. \"I don't know  what we CAN do. I wouldn't mind half so much about the other sneaky  things he does; if it wasn't for the way he treats Laddie. I--\"    \"Suppose we send Lad to the boarding kennels, at Ridgewood, till the  brat is gone?\" suggested the Master. \"I hate to do it. And the good old  chap will be blue with homesickness there. But at least he'll get kind  treatment. When he comes over to me and looks up into my eyes in that  terribly appealing way, after Cyril has done some rotten thing to  him,--well, I feel like a cur, not to be able to justify his faith that  I can make things all right for him. Yes, I think I'll send him to the  boarding kennels. And, if it weren't for leaving you alone to face  things here, I'd be tempted to hire a stall at the kennels for myself,  till the pest is gone.\"    The next day, came a ray of light in the bothered gloom. And the  question of the boarding kennels was dropped. The Mistress received a  letter from Cyril's mother. The European trip had been cut short, for  business reasons; and the two travelers expected to land in New York on  the following Friday.    \"Who dares say Friday is an unlucky day?\" chortled the Master in glee,  as his wife reached this stage of the letter.    \"And,\" the Mistress read on, \"we will come out to the Place, on the  noon train; and take darling Cyril away with us. I wish we could stay  longer with you; but Henry must be in Chicago on Saturday night. So we  must catch a late afternoon train back to town, and take the night  train West. Now, I--\"    \"Most letters are a bore,\" interpolated the Master. \"Or else they're a  bother. But this one is a pure rapture. Read it more slowly, won't,  you, dear? I want to wallow in every blessed word of hope it contains.  Go ahead. I'm sorry I interrupted. Read on. You'll never have such  another enthusiastic audience.\"    \"And now,\" the Mistress continued her reading, \"I am going to ask both  of you not to say a single word to precious Cyril about our coming home  so soon. We want to surprise him. Oh, to think what his lovely face  will be like, when he sees us walking in!\"    \"And to think what MY lovely face will be like, when I see him walking  out!\" exulted the Master. \"Laddie, come over here. We've got the  gorgeousest news ever! Come over and be glad!\"    Lad, at the summons, came trotting out of his cave, and across the  room. Like every good dog who has been much talked to, he was as adept  as any dead-beat in reading the varying shades of the human voice. The  voices and faces alike of his"]]]
