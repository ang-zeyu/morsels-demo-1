Such are the differences among human beings in their sources of  pleasure, their susceptibilities of pain, and the operation on them of  different physical and moral agencies, that unless there is a  corresponding diversity in their modes of life, they neither obtain  their fair share of happiness, nor grow up to the mental, moral, and  aesthetic stature of which their nature is capable. Why then should  tolerance, as far as the public sentiment is concerned, extend only to  tastes and modes of life which extort acquiescence by the multitude of  their adherents? Nowhere (except in some monastic institutions) is  diversity of taste entirely unrecognised; a person may, without blame,  either like or dislike rowing, or smoking, or music, or athletic  exercises, or chess, or cards, or study, because both those who like  each of these things, and those who dislike them, are too numerous to be  put down. But the man, and still more the woman, who can be accused  either of doing \"what nobody does,\" or of not doing \"what everybody  does,\" is the subject of as much depreciatory remark as if he or she had  committed some grave moral delinquency. Persons require to possess a  title, or some other badge of rank, or of the consideration of people of  rank, to be able to indulge somewhat in the luxury of doing as they like  without detriment to their estimation. To indulge somewhat, I repeat:  for whoever allow themselves much of that indulgence, incur the risk of  something worse than disparaging speeches--they are in peril of a  commission _de lunatico_, and of having their property taken from them  and given to their relations.[13]    There is one characteristic of the present direction of public opinion,  peculiarly calculated to make it intolerant of any marked demonstration  of individuality. The general average of mankind are not only moderate  in intellect, but also moderate in inclinations: they have no tastes or  wishes strong enough to incline them to do anything unusual, and they  consequently do not understand those who have, and class all such with  the wild and intemperate whom they are accustomed to look down upon.  Now, in addition to this fact which is general, we have only to suppose  that a strong movement has set in towards the improvement of morals,  and it is evident what we have to expect. In these days such a movement  has set in; much has actually been effected in the way of increased  regularity of conduct, and discouragement of excesses; and there is a  philanthropic spirit abroad, for the exercise of which there is no more  inviting field than the moral and prudential improvement of our  fellow-creatures. These tendencies of the times cause the public to be  more disposed than at most former periods to prescribe general rules of  conduct, and endeavour to make every one conform to the approved  standard. And that standard, express or tacit, is to desire nothing  strongly. Its ideal of character is to be without any marked character;  to maim by compression, like a Chinese lady's foot, every part of human  nature which stands out prominently, and tends to make the person  markedly dissimilar in outline to commonplace humanity.    As is usually the case with ideals which exclude one-half of what is  desirable, the present standard of approbation produces only an inferior  imitation of the other half. Instead of great energies guided by  vigorous reason, and strong feelings strongly controlled by a  conscientious will, its result is weak feelings and weak energies, which  therefore can be kept in outward conformity to rule without any strength  either of will or of reason. Already energetic characters on any large  scale are becoming merely traditional. There is now scarcely any outlet  for energy in this country except business. The energy expended in that  may still be regarded as considerable. What little is left from that  employment, is expended on some hobby; which may be a useful, even a  philanthropic hobby, but is always some one thing, and generally a thing  of small dimensions. The greatness of England is now all collective:  individually small, we only appear capable of anything great by our  habit of combining; and with this our moral and religious  philanthropists are perfectly contented. But it was men of another  stamp than this that made England what it has been; and men of another  stamp will be needed to prevent its decline.    The despotism of custom is everywhere the standing hindrance to human  advancement, being in unceasing antagonism to that disposition to aim at  something better than customary, which is called, according to  circumstances, the spirit of liberty, or that of progress or  improvement. The spirit of improvement is not always a spirit of  liberty, for it may aim at forcing improvements on an unwilling people;  and the spirit of liberty, in so far as it resists such attempts, may  ally itself locally and temporarily with the opponents of improvement;  but the only unfailing and permanent source of improvement is liberty,  since by it there are as many possible independent centres of  improvement as there are individuals. The progressive principle,  however, in either shape, whether as the love of liberty or of  improvement, is antagonistic to the sway of Custom, involving at least  emancipation from that yoke; and the contest between the two constitutes  the chief interest of the history of mankind. The greater part of the  world has, properly speaking, no history, because the despotism of  Custom is complete. This is the case over the whole East. Custom is  there, in all things, the final appeal; justice and right mean  conformity to custom; the argument of custom no one, unless some tyrant  intoxicated with power, thinks of resisting. And we see the result.  Those nations must once have had originality; they did not start out of  the ground populous, lettered, and versed in many of the arts of life;  they made themselves all this, and were then the greatest and most  powerful nations in the world. What are they now? The subjects or  dependants of tribes whose forefathers wandered in the forests when  theirs had magnificent palaces and gorgeous temples, but over whom  custom exercised only a divided rule with liberty and progress. A  people, it appears, may be progressive for a certain length of time, and  then stop: when does it stop? When it ceases to possess individuality.  If a similar change should befall the nations of Europe, it will not be  in exactly the same shape: the despotism of custom with which these  nations are threatened is not precisely stationariness. It proscribes  singularity, but it does not preclude change, provided all change  together. We have discarded the fixed costumes of our forefathers; every  one must still dress like other people, but the fashion may change once  or twice a year. We thus take care that when there is change, it shall  be for change's sake, and not from any idea of beauty or convenience;  for the same idea of beauty or convenience would not strike all the  world at the same moment, and be simultaneously thrown aside by all at  another moment. But we are progressive as well as changeable: we  continually make new inventions in mechanical things, and keep them  until they are again superseded by better; we are eager for improvement  in politics, in education, even in morals, though in this last our idea  of improvement chiefly consists in persuading or forcing other people to  be as good as ourselves. It is not progress that we object to; on the  contrary, we flatter ourselves that we are the most progressive people  who ever lived. It is individuality that we war against: we should think  we had done wonders if we had made ourselves all alike; forgetting that  the unlikeness of one person to another is generally the first thing  which draws the attention of either to the imperfection of his own type,  and the superiority of another, or the possibility, by combining the  advantages of both, of producing something better than either. We have a  warning example in China--a nation of much talent, and, in some  respects, even wisdom, owing to the rare good fortune of having been  provided at an early period with a particularly good set of customs, the  work, in some measure, of men to whom even the most enlightened European  must accord, under certain limitations, the title of sages and  philosophers. They are remarkable, too, in the excellence of their  apparatus for impressing, as far as possible, the best wisdom they  possess upon every mind in the community, and securing that those who  have appropriated most of it shall occupy the posts of honour and power.  Surely the people who did this have discovered the secret of human  progressiveness, and must have kept themselves steadily at the head of  the movement of the world. On the contrary, they have become  stationary--have remained so for thousands of years; and if they are  ever to be farther improved, it must be by foreigners. They have  succeeded beyond all hope in what English philanthropists are so  industriously working at--in making a people all alike, all governing  their thoughts and conduct by the same maxims and rules; and these are  the fruits. The modern _regime_ of public opinion is, in an unorganised  form, what the Chinese educational and political systems are in an  organised; and unless individuality shall be able successfully to assert  itself against this yoke, Europe, notwithstanding its noble antecedents  and its professed Christianity, will tend to become another China.    What is it that has hitherto preserved Europe from this lot? What has  made the European family of nations an improving, instead of a  stationary portion of mankind? Not any superior excellence in them,  which, when it exists, exists as the effect, not as the cause; but"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34903"],[0,"Dress Design: An Account of Costume for Artists & Dressmakers (#20)"],[1," _Cap with comb, 1790-1800_    _Puff comb_]    [Illustration: PATTERN 48.    _Pleated_    _Pleated_    _Pleated_    _Side plaquet_    _Quilted petticoat, 1740-70_    _Waist band_]    [Illustration: PATTERN 49.    _Pleats_    _Pleat to notch_    _Made in lining_    _Petticoat, Fig. B, Plate 16_    _Top_]    [Illustration: PATTERN 50.    _Dress, Fig. B, Plate 16_    _Pleat_    _Under corset_    _Lining back_]    [Illustration: PATTERN 51.    _Dress, Fig. C, Plate 16_    _Neck_    _Lining_    _Box pleats_    _Small pleats_    _S pleats_    _Small pleats_    _S. pleats_    _Pleat_]    [Illustration: PATTERN 52.    _Pleat_    _Pleat_    _Pleat_    _Pleat_    _Pleat_    _Pleat_    _White linen dress, 1795-1805_    _Front_    _Sleeve_    _Gather_    _Button_    _Outside sleeve_    _Caught up thus_]    [Illustration: PATTERN 53.    _Gathered_    _Open to mark_    _Gathered_    _Striped cotton dress, 1805-15_    _Gathered_    _Collar_    _Front_    _Wrist_    _3 sleeve frills_    _Open_    _Gather_]    [Illustration: PATTERN 54.    _Pattern of under robe, 1818-30_    _Gathered_    _Gathered_    _Waist_    _Sleeve_    _S. placquets_]    [Illustration: PATTERN 55.    _Waist band_    _Neck band_    _Gathered_    _Cuff_    _Top_    _Gathered_    _Pattern of Fig C, Plate 25_]    [Illustration: _Muslin dress, 1822-32_    _Cuff_    _Yoke_    PATTERN 56.]    [Illustration: PATTERN 57.    _Gather_    _Gather_    _Satin dress, 1837-45_    _Gather_    _Gather_    _Top_]    [Illustration: PATTERN 58.    _Top gathered to a Fold round sleeve_    _Gathered_    _Dress, Fig. C, Plate 29_    _Gathered_    _Gathered_    _Gather_    _Cape_    _Gathered_    _Gathered_    _Waist_    _Waist_    _Gather_    _Gather_]    [Illustration: PATTERN 59.    _Dress, Fig. B, Plate 28_    _Gathered_    _Gathered_    _Gathered_    _Gathered_    _Band front of waist_    _Waist_]    [Illustration: PATTERN 60.    _Gather_    _Gather_    _Dress, Fig. C, Plate 32._    _Trimming over shoulder_    _Top_    _Gather_    _Gather_    _Tight pleats_    _Waist_]    [Illustration: PATTERN 61.    _Lady's coat, 1856-70_]    [Illustration: PATTERN 62.    _Blue silk dress, 1860-70_    _Fig. A, Plate 32_    _Scale 6 inches_    _Gather_    _Gather_    _Pleat_]    [Illustration: PATTERN 63.    _Reefed polonaise, pinked edge, 1860-70_    _Scale inches_    _Gather_    _Plain_    _Gather_    _Plain_    _Pleat_    _Gather_    _Puff sleeve lining_    _Reefed up_    _Ties_    _Puff sleeve_]    [Illustration: PATTERN 64.    _Lady's jacket, Fig. C, Plate 19_    _Gathered_    _Pleated_]    [Illustration: PATTERN 65.    _Fullness for arm_    _An interesting cape of shot silk, 1840-50_]    [Illustration: PATTERN 66.    _Cut in one_    _Front_    _Cape collar_    _2 pieces_    _Black velvet cape, 1830-40_    _Victorian cape, 1860-75_    _Same cut from 40 ins._]    [Illustration: PATTERN 67.    _Sleeve, 16 century_    _Collar_    _Cut of Doublet and slashed sleeve, 1620-40_    _Sleeve, 1620-40._    _Epaulette_    _Cut of boy's stays, coat, vest, 1700-60_]    [Illustration: PATTERN 68.    _Male Robe 1600-25_    _Black felt Puritan hat, 1640-60_    _V. and A.
