I can think of but one  way in which his statements can be reconciled. Five of the eight Judges  (Saltonstall's seat being vacant) Stoughton, Sewall, Gedney, Corwin and  Hathorne, severally, at different times, sat as Magistrates, at the  Examinations, which occasions were accompanied with vexations and  perplexities, calling for prudence and patience, much more than the  Trials. It is due, therefore, to Mather to suppose that he had  frequented the Examinations, and, thus acquired a right to speak of the  deportment of the Judges, \"upon the _sight_ of their difficulties.\"    Much of the evidence given by the \"afflicted children,\" at the  Examinations, can hardly be accounted for except as drawn from ideas  suggested by Mather, on the spot, so as to reach their ears. In the  testimony of Susannah Sheldon, against John Willard, on the ninth of  May, is the following singular statement: \"There appeared to me a  Shining White man.\" She represents it as a good and friendly angel, or  spirit, accompanied by another \"angel from Heaven,\" protecting her  against the spectre of John Willard.    Prefixed to the London Edition of the _Cases of Conscience_, printed in  1862, is a narrative, by Deodat Lawson, of some remarkable things he saw  and heard, connected with the witchcraft transactions at Salem Village.  In it, is the following statement: \"The first of April, Mercy Lewis saw  in her fit, a white man, and was with him in a glorious place, which had  no candles nor sun, yet was full of light and brightness; where was a  great multitude in white glittering robes; and they sung the Song in  _Revelation_, v., 9, and the one hundred and tenth Psalm, and the one  hundred and forty-ninth Psalm; and said with herself, 'How long shall I  stay here?' 'Let me be along with you!' She was loth to leave the place;  and grieved that she could tarry no longer. This White man hath appeared  several times to some of them, and given them notice how long it should  be before they had another fit, which was, some times, a day, or day  and half, or more or less. It hath fallen out accordingly.\"    In the case of Margaret Rule, in Boston, the year after the Salem  Delusion, of which it is not to be questioned that Mather had the  management, this same \"_White_\" Spirit is made to figure; and also, in  another instance. Mather alludes to the \"glorious and signal deliverance  of that poor damsel,\" Mercy Short, six months before. \"Indeed,\" says he,  \"Margaret's case was, in several points, less remarkable than Mercy's;  and in some other things the entertainment did a little vary.\" Margaret,  Mercy, and the \"afflicted children\" at Salem Village, all had their  \"White Angel,\" as thus stated by Mather: \"Not only in the Swedish, but  also in the Salem Witchcraft, the enchanted people have talked much of a  White Spirit, from whence they received marvellous assistances in their  miseries. What lately befell Mercy Short, from the communications of  such a Spirit, hath been the just wonder of us all; but by such a Spirit  was Margaret Rule now also visited. She says that she could never see  his face; but that she had a frequent view of his bright, shining and  glorious garments; he stood by her bed-side, continually, heartening and  comforting her, and counselling her to maintain her faith and hope in  God, and never comply with the temptations of her adversaries.\"--_Calef_,  3, 8.    This appearance of the \"White and Shining,\" Spirit, or \"White Angel,\"  exercising a good and friendly influence, was entirely out of the line  of ordinary spectral manifestations; constituted a speciality in the  cases mentioned; and seems to have originated in the same source. Let  it, then, be considered that Cotton Mather's favorite precedent, which was  urged upon Sir William Phips, and which Mather brought to the notice of  Richards, and was so fond of citing in his writings, had a \"White Angel.\"  In his account of the \"most horrid outrage, committed in Sweedland by  Devils, by the help of witches,\" we find the following: \"Some of the  children talked much of a White Angel, which did use to forbid them,  what the Devil had bid them to do, and assure them that these things  would not last long; but that what had been done was permitted for the  wickedness of the people. This White Angel would sometimes rescue the  children, from going in with the witches.\"--_Wonders_, 50.    Mr. Hale also notices this feature of the Salem Trials--that the  witnesses swore to \"representations of heavenly beauty, white men.\"    Mather brought the story of this witchcraft \"in Sweedland,\" before the  public, in America; he had the book that contained it; and was active  in giving it circulation. There can be little doubt that he was the  channel through which it found its way to the girls in the hamlet of  Salem Village. He was, it is evident, intimate with Parris. How far the  latter received his ideas from him, is, _as yet_, unknown. That they  were involved in the same responsibility is clear from the fact that  Parris fell back upon him for protection, and relied upon him, as his  champion, throughout his controversy with his people, occasioned by the  witchcraft transactions.    When these considerations are duly weighed, in connection with his  language in the passage of his Diary, just quoted--\"I saw a most  charming instance of prudence and patience\" in the Judges: \"My  compassion upon the sight of their difficulties,\" \"raised by my journeys  to Salem, the chief seat of those diabolical vexations\"--it seems  necessary to infer, that his opportunities of _seeing_ all this, on the  occasions of his \"journeys to Salem,\" must have been afforded by  attending the Examinations, held by the Magistrates who were also  Judges; as it is established, by his own averment, that he never saw  them on the Bench of the Court, at the Jury-trials. It is, therefore,  rendered certain, by his own language and by all the facts belonging to  the subject, that the purpose of his \"journeys to Salem\" was to attend  the Examinations. We are, indeed, shut up to this conclusion.    The Examinations were going on from the first of March, far into the  Summer of 1692. There is no intimation that either of the Mathers  uttered a syllable against the course pursued in them, before or after  the middle of May, when the Government passed into their almost  exclusive possession. All the way through, spectral evidence was  admitted, without restraint or a symptom of misgiving, on their part;  and, whether present or absent, they could not but have known all that  was going on.    Cotton Mather's \"_journeys to Salem_,\" must have been frequent. If only  made two or three times, he would have said so, as he speaks of them in  an apologetic passage and when trying to represent his agency to have  been as little as the truth would allow.    The Reviewer states that the journeys were made for another purpose. He  states it positively and absolutely. \"He made visits to Salem, as we  shall presently see, for quite another purpose than that which has been  alleged.\" This language surprised me, as it had wholly escaped my  researches; and the surprise was accompanied with pleasure, for I  supposed there must be some foundation for the declaration. I looked  eagerly for the disclosure about to be made, in some document, now, for  the first time, to be brought to light, from \"original sources,\" such  as he, in a subsequent passage, informs us, Mr. Longfellow has had  access to. Great was my disappointment, to find that the Reviewer,  notwithstanding his promise to let us know the \"other purpose\" of  Mather's visits to Salem, has not given us a single syllable of  _information_ to that effect, but has endeavored to palm off, upon the  readers of the _North American Review_, a pure fiction of his own brain,  a mere conjecture, as baseless as it is absurd. He says that Mather made  his visits to Salem, as the \"spiritual comforter\" of John Proctor and  John Willard!    He further says, in support of this statement, \"that Proctor and Willard  had been confined several months in the Boston Jail, and there,  doubtless, made Mr. Mather's acquaintance, as he was an habitual visitor  of the prison.\" This hardly accounts for \"journeys to Salem,\" during  _those_ months. Salem was not exactly in Mr. Mather's way from his house  in Boston to the Jail in Boston.    As only a few days over four months elapsed between Proctor's being put  into the Boston Jail and his execution, deducting the \"several months\"  he spent there, but little time remained, after his transfer to the  Salem Jail, for Mather's \"journeys to Salem,\" for the purpose of  administering spiritual consolation to him. So far as making his  \"acquaintance,\" while in Boston Jail is regarded, upon the same ground  it might be affirmed that he was the spiritual adviser of the Prisoners  generally; for most of those, who suffered, were in Boston Jail as long  as Proctor; and he visited them all alike.    The Reviewer adduces not a particle of evidence to prove his absolute  statement, nor even to countenance the idea; but, as is his custom, he  transforms a conjecture into an established fact. On a bare surmise, he  builds an argument, and treats the whole, basis and superstructure, as  History. To show, more particularly, how he thus _makes History_, I must  follow this matter up a little further. Brattle, in his _Account of the  Witchcraft in the County of Essex, 1692_, has this paragraph, after  stating that the persons executed \"went out of the world, not only with  as great protestations, but also with as great shows, of innocency, as  men could do:\" \"They protested their innocency as in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26981"],[0,"Pan-Islam (#20)"],[1,"Islam  it is not advisable to rely too much on the Scriptures, as Moslems doubt  the authenticity of our version and point to our own divergent copies in  proof thereof. Nor is it any use asking them to believe as an act of  faith; if they did they would need no proselytising: an appeal must be  made to their reason, and there is no better appeal than the life,  works, and conduct of one who professes and practises Christianity. Even  if he makes no single convert he has leavened the population around him  with the dignity and prestige of his creed which has produced such a  type. Unfortunately such results cannot be scheduled in mission reports,  though they are real enough and well worth living for, whether a man be  a missionary or not; only they cannot be produced by brilliant  wide-sweeping feats of organisation and enterprise, but by persevering,  consistent lives, which are not easy or spectacular.    Egypt should be a great field of religious warfare by personal  influence, as Christians and Moslems live side by side in daily contact  and reasonable accord, yet few of us take advantage of the fact to  uphold the prestige of our creed or even of our race. We Europeans are  busy with our multifarious interests and duties, while Egyptian Moslems  are either entangled in the web of their environment, as are the  _fellahin_, or eager snatchers at the gifts of civilisation, as are the  more or less cultured effendis, or mere hair-splitters in futile  religious controversy, as are too many of the _ulema_ or sages at the  great collegiate mosque of al-Azhar. In each case, spiritual matters  are apt to get crowded out. The fault lies chiefly with our cosmopolitan  ingredients, which engender feverish living, if not actual vice, and the  over-strained effort on the one side to impart and on the other side to  assimilate a Western system of education which has induced intellectual  dyspepsia. So we hear of students mugging parrot-like to pass  half-yearly examinations, in the hopes of getting Government  appointments for which there are far too many applicants; these young  men besiege the Press with complaints of unfair treatment if they fail,  or even go to the length of attempting suicide with carbolic acid  (fortunately with sufficient caution to ensure it usually being but an  attempt); this latter petulant protest at the temporary thwarting of  their material hopes is dead against all the teaching and tradition of  Islam, but it has become so frequent that a leading educational  authority suggests that no student who attempts suicide shall be allowed  to sit again for a Government examination. Among their seniors up at  al-Azhar are men of real learning and remarkably persevering scholarship  (their theological course makes the average brain reel to contemplate),  but some sheikh started a controversy as to whether Adam was a prophet  or not, which fell among those sages with the disrupting force of a  grenade, causing much litigation in the Islamic courts and culminating  in the divorce of the originator by his wife for _kufr_, or heresy as  ordained by Moslem law. Beneath these troubled waters the _fellah's_  life flows placidly, bounded on the one hand by his crops and on the  other by the market; his spiritual stimulus being supplied by an  occasional religious fair or a visit to the shrine of some local saint.  He toils as patiently as his water-wheel buffalo, and on that toil  depends the wealth of Egypt which supports saints and sinners, schools  and shops, with all our European schemes and enterprises thrown in.    As for us British, if our object is to enhance the prestige of our race  or creed, we fall very short of achievement. We have not even that  reputation for integrity which usually attaches to us in other parts of  the Moslem world. This may be partly due to our anomalous position in  the country, which was thrust upon us, but the pleasure-seeking tourist  of pre-War days has a lot to answer for. Some of them seemed to think  that so far from home their conduct was of no account (at least, that is  the only charitable explanation), and British personal prestige suffered  in consequence. Anglo-Egyptian officials, especially the subordinate  grades, which come into more direct contact with the people, tried to  counteract this by increased dignity of demeanour, but the natives now  knew them _en deshabille_, or thought they did, and declined to keep  them on their pedestals. The result is, familiarity without intimacy and  detachment without dignity, while the pre-War official habit of going  Home every year for some months has prevented even subordinates from  studying their district or department consecutively.    Hence it is that a widespread Nationalist movement gathered force and  perfected its plans for a detailed campaign which blended peaceful  demonstration with sabotage, murder and violence, and took the  Anglo-Egyptian Government completely by surprise, paralysing  communications and intimidating the general public until the weight of  Imperial troops, luckily still quartered in the country, was allowed to  make itself felt and restored order.    This is not the time or the place to discuss these affairs, which are  still _sub judice_, but one salient feature of the movement is pertinent  to our subject, and that is the marked _rapprochement_ between Moslems  and Copts, who fraternised in each other's mosques and churches, carried  flags bearing the device of Cross and Crescent and used American mission  buildings to further their new-found brotherhood. These relations were  somewhat marred by the wholesale devastation of Coptic property  up-country, but the Copts took it very well and paraded the streets with  their Moslem friends, if they could not hide away from them. The local  Jew came in too, and the climax of this religious _entente_ was reached  when an Egyptian Jewess preached in the mosque of al-Azhar on the  ancient relations between Jews and Arabs.    But we must not merely consider Egypt as a sort of religious and racial  clearing house; it is also the main gate of Africa.    Southward, up the Nile valley and across grim deserts, lies Khartoum,  the capital of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, only four days from Cairo by  rail. This is a very tempting theatre for missionary enterprise, which  is, however, held in check by the authorities, who decline to have their  Sudan spiritually exploited and materially disturbed by futile efforts  to evangelise the country. Missionaries say that this part of the Sudan,  as well as Egypt, was once Christian; that discrimination is being shown  in favour of Islam even to the extent of making pagans become Moslem on  joining the Egyptian Army; that Gordon College is being run on  non-Christian lines and that Islam is getting ahead of them in the race  to convert pagans in this part of the world.    The case against them is that the fact of these regions being once  Christian and now Moslem shows, if anything, that the latter religion is  more suited to local requirements and conditions; Islam is naturally  favoured in a Moslem country, though many Christian missions have been  given facilities too, and have mostly failed owing to climatic  conditions: the Egyptian Army is Moslem and under a Moslem Government;  the conversion of pagan recruits to Islam is encouraged for the sake of  discipline and soldierly conduct; missionaries themselves admit that  even in civil life a Christian convert from Islam must be segregated or  he will lapse under surrounding pressure--perhaps they will explain how  that is to be done in a barrack-room or native infantry lines, or would  they prefer such recruits to remain pagan? Presumably they would, as one  of their complaints is that \"it is a thousand times harder to convert a  Moslem to Christianity than a pagan.\" Comment is superfluous; nothing  could portray their attitude more clearly. As for Islam getting ahead of  them in the race for pagan souls, it is so and will be so always among  the black races unless Christian missions are bolstered up by all the  resources of local authority; the reason is that Islam offers equal  privileges and no colour-line, imposes easy spiritual obligations and is  propagated fervently by its followers without the encumbrance of an  organised priesthood. Just as commercial travellers consider a district  neglected where a rival firm has got ahead of them, so missionaries are  piqued at conditions in the Sudan; but even that does not excuse such  statements as that women in the Sudan are free and not badly treated as  pagans, but slaves and oppressed under Islam. Every student of the  Islamic code knows that the status of women has been enormously improved  thereby as compared with any pagan system. Missionaries must know this,  for they are much better educated about Islam than they were a quarter  of a century ago, yet they do not scruple to raise the partisan cry of a  debased womanhood under Islam wherever local conditions involve domestic  hardship. Such tactics are unworthy of them; an intellectual Moslem does  not reproach Christianity because he has visited districts in the poorer  quarters of our big towns and seen women lead lives of drudgery or being  sometimes knocked about by their husbands.    Outside the Sudan and Nigeria we must keep to the eastern side of Africa  in order to maintain touch with Islam. The negroid people of Italian  Erythrea are Moslems, as are also the Somalis; but their racial cousins,  the Abyssinians, are Christians of the Ethiopian Church, with the Negus  as their temporal and spiritual ruler, who claims descent from King  Solomon and the Queen of Sheba.    Abyssinia has been Christian ever since the fourth century, but the  missionaries are not happy about the country at all. Here nothing  impedes the entrance of the missionary as an individual, but the people  will not have him as an evangelist at any price. The \"fanatical"]]]
