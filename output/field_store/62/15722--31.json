[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34131"],[0,"Butterflies and Moths (British) (#20)"],[1," 'Catching Butterflies,' leaving all the indoor work to  form the substance of another chapter. Our next point, then, shall be  the consideration of seasons, times, and localities.    The earliest of the butterflies make their appearance on the wing in  April, or, if the weather is mild, towards the end of March; and from  this time you can find employment up to the end of September or the  beginning of October--a period of about seven months. But it must not be  supposed that all parts of this long season are equally prolific, and  will yield equally valuable catches. Remember the short term of a  butterfly's life, and bear in mind that each one has its own regular  season in which to spend the winged state; you will then see that anyone  who wishes to 'work' as many species as possible must arrange his  outings in accordance with the insects' own times.    Some butterflies are double-brooded, and the two broods may not come  forth at certain fixed times. Hence they seem to be on the wing almost  without cessation for several months together, and therefore need not  have a special day set apart for them. But others are more uniform in  their date of appearance, and die off at about the same time. To catch  such as these you must be careful to watch the weather, make allowance  for any severities that may tend to cause a delay, or an unusually high  temperature that may hasten their emergence, and then select a day in  which you may expect to find them fresh and unworn. A week too early,  and none are to be seen; a week too late, and nearly all you catch are  worn and worthless.    A glance at our Calendar (Appendix II) will give you a few illustrations  in point. Thus you will observe that May is a month for the 'Whites,'  early 'Blues' and certain of the Fritillaries; July for most of the  Hairstreaks and Browns, and so on. Before you have been long collecting  you will have captured the very common species, and then you will find  that your butterfly hunts are very unproductive unless you make it a  point to try for certain species at the proper times.    Time, however, is not the only thing to take into account when preparing  for a day with the butterflies. It is equally important that we should  carefully select our locality in accordance with the known haunts of the  various species. As long as you are simply working up the common kinds,  you may wander almost at random in waste places, flowery meadows, corn  fields, railway banks, &c.; but when you have secured a few specimens of  each of these, you must search out the favoured resorts of the more  local and the rarer species. For instance, wooded spots must be visited  if you are to take certain of the Fritillaries, oak woods for the Purple  Emperor and the Purple Hairstreak, fenny districts for the beautiful  Swallow-tail, and so forth. In some cases the butterflies are closely  restricted to certain isolated localities, to which you must travel if  determined to obtain them.    There yet remains another important matter to consider, and that is the  kind of day you shall select for your outing. Butterflies are not only  strictly day-fliers, but most of them venture out only on bright days.  Always choose as hot a day as possible, with a very bright sun. If you  are to be out for a full day's collecting, manage to be on the hunting  ground at about ten o'clock in the morning. As a rule there are not many  out before this time, and some do not appear to stir till an hour later:  still there are a few 'early birds' among them, one of which--the Wall  Butterfly--I have seen on the wing before eight.    If your season, your day, and your locality are all well chosen, you may  reckon on a good six hours' work. At about four the butterflies begin to  lag, and then drop into their hiding places, one by one, till only a few  of the late stragglers remain on the wing.    So far I have furnished some general instructions that may be regarded  as preparatory to the start; but I will now give a few hints as to the  mode of procedure when the day for field work has come.    First, see that you have secured _all_ your apparatus, and that it is in  perfect condition. What is more annoying than to find, after you have  travelled some miles to get to your hunting ground, that you have left  your screw ferrule at home, or that the soldering of your metal Y is  just giving way? If you are troubled with a short memory, it will be  advisable to make out a list of every requisite for your field work, and  keep this for reference on all field days.    Here is a list of your equipment for a day with the butterflies. Net,  ferrule or Y, stick, collecting box (the cork of which should be damped  if the box is a metal one), a few 'chip boxes' for live insects, killing  apparatus, a good supply of pins of several sizes, a piece of string,  needle and cotton, and your penknife.    You observe in this list one or two items not previously mentioned,  since they hardly come under the category of apparatus, but a moment's  thought will convince you of their usefulness, especially in the case of  a breakdown. If your net catches in a thorn--a very common  occurrence--and a big rent is made, the needle and cotton will save you  a deal of agony, and perhaps loss of temper. If your stick breaks under  your exertions, the knife or the string may prove a most valuable  companion. Your pins may be stuck in the cork of your collecting box,  certainly the most convenient spot for immediate use; but you may also  have a reserve store in a small pocket cushion, or arranged neatly on a  strip of flannel which can be rolled up in the waistcoat pocket.    At last you are on the hunting ground, fully equipped but inexperienced,  and at first find yourself just a little awkward in the use of your new  gear. Your experience with the cap has been a very wide one, and you are  possibly an expert at knocking down 'Whites' in the streets and in your  neighbour's kitchen gardens. Now you have to wield the net, and coax  your captives into your killing bottle; hence a slight feeling of  incompetence at first.    You soon get over this, however, and within five minutes you may be seen  furiously slashing away at all the poor butterflies that come within  range, common 'Whites' and dingy 'Browns' receiving as much attention at  your hands as any rare gem that may happen to cross your path.    How different are the movements of an experienced collector! He walks  stealthily along the route he has chosen, apparently taking but little  notice of the majority of butterflies that approach and pass him. He has  already secured his 'series' of nearly all the species, and is carefully  on the watch for the gems that are required to complete his cabinet. His  actions are slow and deliberate rather than rash; and he trusts more to  his eyes than his legs.    The beginner may take to his field work quite to his own satisfaction,  and may travel homeward with a feeling of great pride over his first  day's catch; but yet there are a few points in which a little advice may  not be quite out of place, particularly so with regard to the management  of the net, and the killing and pinning of the insects.    Most of the butterflies may be caught on the wing, and it is far better  to net them in the air than to sweep them off the herbage and flowers.  If these are rather low, you should strike the net smartly _upwards_  from below them, but of course this movement is impossible with insects  that happen to be almost above your reach. If a butterfly is busily  engaged in searching out its sweet food, flying from flower to flower,  don't think of giving chase, but follow it up stealthily, and you will  sooner or later get an opportunity of striking at it while in the air.  Sometimes, however, you will see a powerful flier making a straight dash  across your field, taking no notice whatever of the fragrant blossoms,  but evidently engaged on some important errand. If such happens to be a  species you require, then you must run for it, but you will probably be  satisfied with only a few chases of this kind, particularly if the sun  is very hot, and the ground diversified with clumps of furze, heather,  'molehills,' and ditches.    There are times when your only plan of netting a butterfly is to sweep  it from a flower or leaf on which it has settled. If the vegetation is  very low, you have simply to bring the net down upon it, and then,  holding up the apex of the net with the other hand so as to give it room  to fly, you can inclose it by grasping the lower part of the net as soon  as the butterfly has fluttered upward. If the herbage is tall it is  advisable to strike either upward or sideways at the insect, starting it  from the leaf or flower on which it rests; for if you bring _down_ the  net you will have to inclose the whole or part of the plant on which the  butterfly has settled--a procedure that often ends in a torn net, or in  the insect becoming damaged through being rubbed against the plant.    Whenever you capture a butterfly by a sweep of the net through the air,  you immediately turn the ring into a horizontal position, so that the  bag of the net closes itself as it falls over the edge. This gives you  an opportunity of examining the insect before you introduce your killing  bottle. This is a very necessary precaution, for you are generally  unable to judge of the condition of a butterfly while on the wing, and  in some cases you cannot even be certain of the species. If, then, you  were to call the killing bottle into requisition for every capture you  make, you would certainly find yourself taking the life of many an  insect that is of no use whatever to you. Always examine your specimens  at the moment they have been secured, at least as far as it is possible  to do so, by looking through the gauze; and let your examination be as  brief as possible, or some of the butterflies that were at first in  splendid "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34175"],[0,"Domestic Animals (#20)"],[1,"color, either  pure or fancifully mixed, varies from the white or black of our own  country, to every shade of brown, dun, buff, blue, and gray, like the  spotted flocks of the Cape of Good Hope and other parts of Africa and  Asia. This wide diversity is the result of long domestication, under  almost every conceivable variety of condition.      Uses.    Among the antediluvians, sheep were immolated for sacrificial offerings,  and their fleeces probably furnished them with clothing. Since the  deluge, their flesh has with all nations been used as a favorite food  for man. By many of the rude, roving nations of the East, they are  employed in carrying burdens.    Their milk is generally used by the uncivilized, and to some extent by  the refined nations of Europe, not only as a beverage, but for making  into cheese, butter, and curds. Job refers to its use, as do Isaiah and  other of the Old Testament writers. Most of the Greek and Roman authors  describe its general use and manufacture. The ewe's milk scarcely  differs in appearance from that of the cow, but is generally thicker,  and yields a pale, yellowish butter, that is always soft and soon  becomes rancid. Culley remarks, \"the cheese from their milk is  exceedingly pungent, and for that reason is preferred by many to that  from the cow.\" In Wales, the milk is mixed with that of the dairy, and  makes a tart, palatable cheese. We have never seen it appropriated for  dairy purposes in the United States, except by a few Welsh and Highland  emigrants. The sheep is frequently employed in the dairy regions of this  country, at the tread-mill or horizontal wheel, to pump the water, churn  the milk, or perform other light domestic work.    The dignity and importance of the shepherd's vocation have ever been  conspicuous. Abel, the supposed twin-brother of the first-born of the  human race, was a \"keeper of sheep;\" and from this, it may be fairly  inferred, that there is no animal which has so long been under the  immediate control of man. Abraham and his descendants, as well as most  of the ancient patriarchs, were shepherds. Job had 14,000 sheep. It is  said of Rachel, the favored mother of the Jewish race, \"she came with  her father's sheep, for she kept them.\" The seven daughters of the  priest of Midian, \"came and drew water for their father's flocks.\"  Moses, the statesman and lawgiver, who \"was learned in all the wisdom of  the Egyptians, kept the flocks of Jethro, his father-in-law;\" and David,  the future monarch of Israel, the hero, poet, and divine, was a keeper  of sheep. It was to shepherds, while \"abiding in the field, keeping  watch over their flocks by night,\" that the birth of the Saviour was  announced. The root of the Hebrew name for sheep, signifies  fruitfulness, abundance, plenty; as indicating the blessings they were  destined to confer on the human race. With the sacred writers, they were  the chosen symbol of purity and the gentler virtues; they were the  victims of propitiatory sacrifices; and finally, they became the type of  redemption to fallen man. These may not be considered accidental  allusions in a book, whose every feature is full of design.    Nor has the sheep been less the subject of eulogy and attention with  profane writers. Among these, Homer and Hesiod, Virgil and Theocritus,  introduced them with evident delight in their pastoral themes; while  their heroes and demigods, Hercules and Ulysses, AEneas and Numa,  carefully perpetuated them throughout their regal domains.    In modern times, they have commanded the attention of the most  enlightened nations; and their prosperity has in no instance been  independent of those useful animals, wherever wool and its manufactures  have been regarded as essential staples. Spain and Portugal, for more  than two centuries, were the most enterprising nations of Europe, and  during that period, they excelled in the production and manufacture of  wool. Flanders, for a time, was before England in the perfection of the  arts and the enjoyments of life, and _England then sent the little wool  she raised to that country to be manufactured_. Her politic sovereigns  soon found this a losing game, and offered large bounties for the  importation of artists and machinery. By a systematic and thorough  course of legislation, which looked to the utmost protection and  augmentation of wool and woollens, she has carried their production  beyond any thing the world has ever seen. The small islands of Great  Britain and Ireland, in addition to the support of their 26,000,000 of  people, 15,000,000 of cattle, 2,250,000 horses, 18,000,000 swine, and  innumerable smaller domestic animals, maintain over 40,000,000 sheep,  worth $250,000,000; and besides manufacturing nearly all their fleeces,  annually import nearly an equal amount from abroad. The sumptuary law  for burying the dead in woollen, still occupies its place in their  statute book. And beyond all question, England is the leading power of  the nineteenth century, in the combination of all those qualities which  constitute national greatness, civilization, and strength.      VARIETIES.    Naturalists have divided the wild sheep into four varieties. The  _Musimon_, (_Ovis Musimon_,) inhabiting Corsica, Sardinia, and other  islands of the Mediterranean, the mountainous parts of Spain and Greece,  and some other regions bordering upon that inland sea, have been  frequently domesticated and mixed with the long-cultivated breeds.    The _Argali_, (_O. Ammon_,) ranges over the steppes, or elevated plains  of Central Asia, northward and eastward to the ocean. They are larger,  more hardy, and more untameable than the Musimon.    The _Rocky Mountain Sheep_, (_O. Montana_,) frequently called the  _Big-horn_ by our western hunters, is found on the prairies west of the  Mississippi, and throughout the wild mountainous regions, extending  through California and Oregon to the Pacific. They are larger, but in  other respects resemble the Argali, of which they are probably  descendants, as they could easily cross upon the ice at Behring's  Straits, from the northeastern coast of Asia. Like the Argali, when  caught young they are easily tamed; but we are not aware that they have  ever been bred with the domestic sheep. Before the country was overrun  by the white man, they probably inhabited the region bordering on the  Mississippi. Father Hennepin, a French Jesuit, who wrote nearly two  hundred years ago, often speaks of meeting with goats in his travels  through what is now the territory embraced by Illinois and Wisconsin.  The wild, clambering propensities of these animals, occupying the giddy  heights far beyond the reach of the traveller, and the outer coating of  hair (supplied underneath, however, with a thick coating of soft wool)  gives to them much of the appearance of that animal. In summer they are  generally found single; but when they descend from their isolated, rocky  heights in winter, they are gregarious, marching in flocks under the  guidance of leaders.    The _Bearded Sheep of Africa_ (_O. Tragelaphus_) inhabit the mountains  of Barbary and Egypt. They are covered with a soft, reddish hair, and  have a mane hanging below the neck, and large locks of hair at the  ankle.      The Domesticated Sheep (_O. Aries_)    Embraces all the varieties of the subjugated species. Whether they have  descended from any one of the wild races, is a question yet  undetermined among naturalists; but however this may be, many of the  varieties apparently differ less from their wild namesakes than from  each other.    The _fat-rumped_ and _the broad-tailed sheep_ are much more extensively  diffused than any other. They occupy nearly all the southeastern part of  Europe, Western and Central Asia, and Northern Africa. They are supposed  to be the varieties which were propagated by the patriarchs and their  descendants, the Jewish race. This is inferred from various passages in  the Pentateuch, Exodus xxix. 22; Leviticus iii. 9; viii. 25; ix. 19, and  some others, where \"the fat and the rump\" are spoken of in connection  with offerings, in which the fat was always an acceptable ingredient.  Dr. Boothroyd renders one of the foregoing passages, \"the large, fat  tail entire, taken clear to the rump.\" It is certain this variety gives  indisputable evidence of remote and continued subjugation. Their long,  pendent, drowsy ears, and the highly artificial posterior developments,  are characteristic of no wild or recently-domesticated race.    This breed consists of numerous sub-varieties, differing in all their  characteristics of size, fleece, color, &c., with quite as many and  marked shades of distinction as the modern European varieties. In  Madagascar, they are covered with hair; in the south of Africa, with  coarse wool; in the Levant, and along the Mediterranean, the wool is  comparatively fine; and from that of the fat-rumped sheep of Thibet the  exquisite Cashmere shawls are manufactured. Both rams and ewes are  sometimes bred with horns, and sometimes without, and they exhibit a  great diversity of color. Some yield a carcass of scarcely 30 lbs.,  while others have weighed 200 lbs. dressed. The tail or rump varies  greatly, according to the purity and style of breeding; some are less  than one-eighth, while others exceed one-third the entire dressed  weight. The fat of the rump or tail is considered a great delicacy, and  in hot climates resembles oil, and in colder, suet.    The broad-tailed sheep were brought into this country, about 50 years  since, by Commodore Barron and Judge Peters, and bred with the native  flocks. They were called the Tunisian mountain sheep. Some of them were  subsequently distributed by Col. Pickering, of Massachusetts, among the  farmers of Pennsylvania; and their mixed descendants were highly prized  as prolific and good nurses, coming early to maturity, attaining large  weights, of a superior quality of carcass, and yielding"]]]
