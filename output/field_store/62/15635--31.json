Her first work was the translation of a book from the Hebrew,  \"Israel Defended.\" Next came \"The Magic Wreath,\" a collection of poems,  and then her well-known works, \"Home Influence,\" \"The Spirit of  Judaism,\" her best production, \"The Women of Israel,\" \"The Jewish  Faith,\" and \"History of the Jews in England\"--a rich harvest for one  whose span of life was short. Her pen was dipped into the blood of her  veins and the sap of her nerves; the sacred fire of the prophets burnt  in her soul, and she was inspired by olden Jewish enthusiasm and  devotion to a trust.    So ardent a spirit could not long be imprisoned within so frail a body.  In the very prime of life, just thirty-one years old, Grace Aguilar  passed away, as though her beautiful soul were hastening to shake off  the mortal coil. She rests in German earth, in the Frankfort Jewish  cemetery. Her grave is marked with a simple stone, bearing an equally  simple epitaph:        \"Give her of the fruit of her hands,      And let her own works praise her in the gates.\"    Her death was deeply lamented far and wide. She was a golden link in the  chain of humanity--a bold, courageous, withal thoroughly womanly woman,  a God-inspired daughter of her race and faith. \"We are persuaded,\" says  a non-Jewish friend of hers, \"that had this young woman lived in the  times of frightful persecution, she would willingly have mounted the  stake for her faith, praying for her murderers with her last breath.\"  That the nobility of a solitary woman, leaping like a flame from heart  to heart, may inspire high-minded thoughts, and that Grace Aguilar's  life became a blessing for her people and for humanity, is illustrated  by the following testimonial signed by several hundred Jewish women,  presented to her when she was about to leave England:    \"Dearest Sister--Our admiration of your talents, our veneration for your  character, our gratitude for the eminent services your writings render  our sex, our people, our faith, in which the sacred cause of true  religion is embodied: all these motives combine to induce us to intrude  on your presence, in order to give utterance to sentiments which we are  happy to feel and delighted to express. Until you arose, it has, in  modern times, never been the case that a Woman in Israel should stand  forth the public advocate of the faith of Israel; that with the depth  and purity of feelings which is the treasure of woman, and with the  strength of mind and extensive knowledge that form the pride of man, she  should call on her own to cherish, on others to respect, the truth as it  is in Israel.    \"You, dearest Sister, have done this, and more. You have taught us to  know and appreciate our dignity; to feel and to prove that no female  character can be ... more pure than that of the Jewish maiden, none more  pious than that of the woman in Israel. You have vindicated our social  and spiritual equality with our brethren in the faith: you have, by your  own excellent example, triumphantly refuted the aspersion, that the  Jewish religion leaves unmoved the heart of the Jewish woman. Your  writings place within our reach those higher motives, those holier  consolations, which flow from the spirituality of our religion, which  urge the soul to commune with its Maker and direct it to His grace and  His mercy as the best guide and protector here and hereafter....\"    Her example fell like seed upon fertile soil, for Abigail Lindo, Marian  Hartog, Annette Salomon, and especially Anna Maria Goldsmid, a writer of  merit, daughter of the well-known Sir Isaac Lyon Goldsmid, may be  considered her disciples, the fruit of her sowing.    The Italian poetess, Rachel Morpurgo, a worthy successor of Deborah  Ascarelli and Sara Copia Sullam, was contemporaneous with Grace Aguilar,  though her senior by twenty-six years. Our interest in her is heightened  by her use of the Hebrew language, which she handled with such  consummate skill that her writings easily take rank with the best of  neo-Hebraic literature. A niece of the famous scholar S. D. Luzzatto,  she was born at Triest, April 8, 1790. Until the age of twelve she  studied the Bible, then she read Bechai's \"Duties of the Heart\" and  Rashi's commentary, and from her fourteenth to her sixteenth year she  devoted herself to the Talmud and the Zohar--a remarkable course of  study, pursued, too, in despite of adverse circumstances. At the same  time she was taught the turner's art by Luzzatto's father, and later she  learned tailoring. One of her poems having been published without her  knowledge, she gives vent to her regret in a sonnet:        \"My soul surcharged with grief now loud complains,        And fears upon my spirit heavily weigh.        'Thy poem we have heard,' the people say,      'Who like to thee can sing melodious strains?'      'They're naught but sparks,' outspeaks my soul in chains,        'Struck from my life by torture every day.        But now all perfume's fled--no more my lay      Shall rise; for, fear of shame my song restrains.'        A woman's fancies lightly roam, and weave        Themselves into a fairy web. Should I        Refrain? Ah! soon enough this pleasure, too,        Will flee! Verily I cannot conceive        Why I'm extolled. For woman 'tis to ply        The spinning wheel--then to herself she's true.\"    This painful self-consciousness, coupled with the oppression of material  cares, forms the sad refrain of Rachel Morpurgo's writings. She is a  true poetess: the woes of humanity are reflected in her own sorrows, to  which she gave utterance in soulful tones. She, too, became an exemplar  for a number of young women. A Pole, Yenta Wohllerner, like Rachel  Morpurgo, had to propitiate churlish circumstances before she could  publish the gifts of her muse, and Miriam Mosessohn, Bertha Rabbinowicz,  and others, emulated her masterly handling of the Hebrew language.    The opening of the new era was marked by the appearance of a triad of  Jewesses--Grace Aguilar in England, Rachel Morpurgo in Italy, and  Henriette Ottenheimer in Germany. A native of the blessed land of  Suabia, Henriette Ottenheimer was consecrated to poetry by intercourse  with two masters of song--Uhland and Rueckert. Her poems, fragrant  blossoms plucked on Suabian fields, for the most part are no more than  sweet womanly lyrics, growing strong with the force of enthusiasm only  when she dwells upon her people's sacred mission and the heroes of Bible  days.    Women like these renew the olden fame of the Jewess, and add  achievements to her brilliant record. As for their successors and  imitators, our contemporaries, whose literary productions are before us,  on them we may not yet pass judgment; their work is still on probation.    One striking circumstance in connection with their activity should be  pointed out, because it goes to prove the soundness of judgment, the  penetration, and expansiveness characteristic of Jews. While the  movement for woman's complete emancipation has counted not a single  Jewess among its promoters, its more legitimate successor, the movement  to establish woman's right and ability to earn a livelihood in any  branch of human endeavor--a right and ability denied only by prejudice,  or stupidity--was headed and zealously supported by Jewesses, an  assertion which can readily be proved by such names as Lina Morgenstern,  known to the public also as an advocate of moderate religious reforms,  Jenny Hirsch, Henriette Goldschmidt, and a number of writers on subjects  of general and Jewish interest, such as Rachel Meyer, Elise Levi  (Henle), Ulla Frank-Wolff, Johanna Goldschmidt, Caroline Deutsch, in  Germany; Rebekah Eugenie Foa, Julianna and Pauline Bloch, in France;  Estelle and Maria Hertzveld, in Holland, and Emma Lazarus, in America.    One other name should be recorded. Fanny Neuda, the writer of \"Hours of  Devotion,\" and a number of juvenile stories, has a double claim upon our  recognition, inasmuch as she is an authoress of the Jewish race who has  addressed her writings exclusively to Jewish women.    We have followed Jewish women from the days of their first flight into  the realm of song through a period of two thousand years up to modern  times, when our record would seem to come to a natural conclusion. But I  deem it proper to bring to your attention a set of circumstances which  would be called phenomenal, were it not, as we all know, that the  greatest of all wonders is that true wonders are so common.    It is a well-known fact, spread by literary journals, that the  Rothschild family, conspicuous for financial ability, has produced a  goodly number of authoresses. But it is less well known, and much more  noteworthy, that many of the excellent women of this family have devoted  their literary gifts and attainments to the service of Judaism. The  palaces of the Rothschilds, the richest family in the world, harbor many  a warm heart, whose pulsations are quickened by the thought of Israel's  history and poetic heritage. Wealth has not abated a jot of their  enthusiasm and loyal love for the faith. The first of the house of  Rothschild to make a name for herself as an authoress was Lady  Charlotte Rothschild, in London, one of the noblest women of our time,  who, standing in the glare of prosperity, did not disdain to take up the  cudgels in defense of her people, to go Sabbath after Sabbath to her  poor, unfortunate sisters in faith, and expound to them, in the school  established by her generosity, the nature and duties of a moral,  religious life, in lectures pervaded by the spirit of truth and faith.  Two volumes of these addresses have been published in German and English  (1864 and 1869), and every page gives evidence of rare piety,  considerable scholarship, thorough knowledge of the Bible, and a high  degree of culture. Equal enthusiasm for Judaism pervades the two volumes  of \"Thoughts"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27911"],[0,"The Giraffe Hunters (#20)"],[1,"again resumed, the chief leading the way with two of his  subjects, one on each side of him carrying torches.    After proceeding a little farther the prisoners recognised the spot  where they had been made prisoners.  The chief then delivered an  harangue to his followers, which Congo interpreted to his  fellow-captives.  The bearing of it was, that the white strangers had  wilfully and maliciously killed two of his horses,--the finest animals  in the world.  They had refused to make such reparation as lay in their  power; and, when he had attempted to recompense himself for their loss,  he had been resisted, knocked down, and severely injured in the presence  of his own people.  He stated, furthermore, that it was the unanimous  opinion of the oldest and wisest of his subjects, that for these crimes  the prisoners ought to be punished,--that the punishment should be  death; and that he had brought them to the spot where the first offence  had been committed as a proper spot for executing this just decree.    After Congo had translated the speech to his fellow-captives, they  directed him to inform the chief that he was welcome to the horses,  guns, and other property, if he would let them depart, and they would  promise never to return to his country or trouble him any more.  Moreover, they would send him a present, by way of ransom for their  liberty and lives.    In answer to this communication they were told, that, as they were white  men, their words could not be relied upon.  Instead of presents, they  would be more likely to seek some revenge; and that, to guard against  this, he was determined they should die.    Against this decision they were not allowed to make any appeal.  From  that moment no attention was paid to anything they said.  Their guards  only shouted, when Congo attempted to put in a word; while those who  were around the chief began to make preparations for carrying out the  dread sentence of death.        CHAPTER TWENTY NINE.    JUST IN TIME.    It was soon known to the captives, what mode of death was to be adopted  for them.  The gestures of the chief made it manifest, that he was about  to make trial of his new weapon,--Willem's roer.    One reason why his prisoners had been spared so long may have been for  the purpose of learning how to use the weapon with effect, on an  occasion so important as the execution of two white men.    The rheims that bound Hendrik's wrists had been tied much tighter than  was necessary.  The green hide had shrunk in the burning sun to which  the prisoners had been exposed during the day.  In consequence, his  hands were lacerated and swollen, and he was suffering more torture than  either of the others.    This was not all the agony he was enduring.  The fate Congo at first  only conjectured had now assumed a horrible certainty.  Death seemed  inevitable; and Hendrik's active mind, susceptible of strong emotions,  became painfully anxious at the approach of death.  He feared it.  Nor  did that fear arise from an ignoble cause.  It was simply the love of  life, and the desire to cling to it.    He who loves not life is unworthy of its blessings; for those who hold  them cheap, and would part with them willingly, have either not the  sense to appreciate, or are so evil as only to know life's bitterness.    Hendrik had a strong desire to live,--to enjoy future days;--and, as he  looked upon the preparations being made to deprive him of it, he felt an  unutterable anguish.  Of all his regrets at parting with the world,  there was one supreme,--one thought that was uppermost.  That thought  was given to Wilhelmina Van Wyk.  He should never see her again!  His  love of her was stronger than his love of life.    \"Willem,\" he exclaimed, \"must this be?  Shall we die here?  I will  not,--I cannot!\"    As he spoke, the whole strength of his soul and body was concentrated  into one effort for regaining his liberty.  He struggled to release his  wrists from the rheims.  The effort was not without a result.  It sent  the drops of blood dripping from the ends of his fingers.    Groot Willem was not unmoved in these dire moments.  He too had his  unwillingness to die,--his chapter of regrets.  One, that he should  never again see his relatives; another, that the object for which he had  undertaken the expedition could never be accomplished.    The faithful Kaffir was not rendered insensible by knowing that death  was awaiting him, and now near at hand.    \"Baas Willem,\" he said, looking pityingly upon his young master, \"you be  going to die.  I bless that God your father and mother has told me  about.  I never more go back to Graaf Reinet, to see them cry for you.\"    The arrangements for the execution were by this time completed; but the  cruel chief was not allowed to try his skill in the manner he had  designed.    Just as he was about to raise the roer to his shoulder and take aim at  one of the condemned captives, a large party of dark-skinned men made  their appearance upon the spot.    In the scene of confusion caused by their arrival, the would-be  murderers knew not whether they were friends or foes, until they heard a  war-cry that was strange to their ears, and saw themselves surrounded by  a body of stalwart warriors armed with bows, spears, and guns,--at least  two guns were seen, carried by two white men, whom the captives joyfully  recognised.  It was Hans and Arend.  Their companions were Macora and  his Makololo.    The reprieve was effected in an instant, and along with it the release  of the prisoners.    There was no occasion for the shedding of blood, for there was no  resistance made on the part of the intended executioners.  Their  captives were at once delivered up along with their guns, horses, and  other property,--the principal part of which was restored before any  explanation could be given.    And now again was Groot Willem called upon to obey the dictates of a  humane heart, and intercede with Macora to obtain mercy for others.  But  for him, the Makololo chief would have put to death every Zooloo upon  the ground, and then proceeded to their village to seek further  retaliation.    They all united in restraining him from violence; and the baffled  murderers were permitted to take their departure without the least  outrage being inflicted upon them.    \"Your arrival was very fortunate,\" said Hendrik, addressing Hans and  Arend.  \"Just in the nick of time; but to me it is very mysterious.  How  came you and your friends here to know of our dilemma?\"    \"There's no great mystery about it,\" answered Hans.  \"When we were told  this morning that you were captured and in danger of being killed, of  course we started immediately, and have been travelling all day in hot  haste to your rescue.\"    \"But how was it possible for you to learn that we were in trouble?\"    \"From Sindo, the man Macora was going to kill for his ambition.\"    Sindo, then, had not been ungrateful; he had walked, or rather run, all  night, to give warning of the danger threatening those to whom he owed  his life.  Having no influence among their captors, he knew that the  only plan for serving the captives was to give notice to those who had  power to assist them.  This act of gratitude he had successfully  accomplished.    There is many a slip between the cup and the lip.  The adage was in  their case illustrated.  But for the mention of Sindo's name, as the  captives were being conducted to the place of execution, awakening in  the Zooloo's mind a suspicion of treachery, the rescuers would have  arrived too late.  The delay caused by the inquiry after Sindo, at the  village, was that which had caused the cup to slip.    The released captives now inquired for Sindo, wishing to embrace him.    He was not upon the ground.  Completely exhausted with his long run, he  had not been able to return with the deliverers, but had remained at the  camp, where the hopo was being constructed.    No time was lost in staying by a spot fraught with so many unpleasant  memories; and by the dawn of day our adventurers and their African  friends were well on the way towards their encampment.    On reaching it they found Swartboy in a state of strange mental  confusion, through joy at their return, and anger at Congo, for having  allowed those under his care to get into such terrible trouble.    The service that Sindo had rendered his white friends fully  re-established him in the favour of Macora, and he was invited to make  his home again among his own people,--an invitation that was eagerly  accepted.        CHAPTER THIRTY.    THE HOPO.    Groot Willem was, for the time, cured of the desire to seek further  adventures in the chase.  He had come to the place for the express  purpose of procuring two young giraffes, and taking them safely to the  Dutch consul.  The experience of the last few days had shown him that  his object would not be better accomplished by thus exposing himself to  the chances of dying some horrible death.  Guided by this dearly-bought  belief he was contented to amuse himself by joining the Makololo in the  construction of the trap.  In this work he was assisted by the other  three, all of whom were now thinking more of home than of giraffes, or  anything else.    The trap was to consist of two high fences converging upon each other,  so as to form a figure somewhat in shape like the letter V.  They were  to be about a mile and a half long; and at the point of convergence a  space was to be left open, wide enough to permit of the largest animal  to pass through.  Beyond the angle, or where it should have been, had  the fences met, was dug a pit about forty feet long, fifteen wide, and  eight deep.  Heavy trunks of trees were laid along its edges, slightly  projecting over them.  The intention was, that any animal driven through  would be precipitated into the pit from which escape would be  impossible.  Near it the fences were made of great strength and height,  "]]]
