At no time in the annals of       the nation has there been a more auspicious moment to retrieve       the one false step of the fathers in their concessions to       slavery. The Constitution has been repudiated, and the compact       broken by the Southern traitors now in arms. The firing of the       first gun on Sumter released the North from all constitutional       obligations to slavery. It left the Government, for the first       time in our history, free to carry out the Declaration of our       Revolutionary fathers, and made us in fact what we have ever       claimed to be, a nation of freemen.         \"The Union as it was\"--a compromise between barbarism and       civilization--can never be restored, for the opposing principles       of freedom and slavery can not exist together. Liberty is life,       and every form of government yet tried proves that slavery is       death. In obedience to this law, our Republic, divided and       distracted by the collisions of caste and class, is tottering to       its base, and can only be reconstructed on the sure foundations       of impartial freedom to all men. The war in which we are involved       is not the result of party or accident, but a forward step in the       progress of the race never to be retraced. Revolution is no time       for temporizing or diplomacy. In a radical upheaving, the people       demand eternal principles to stand upon.         Northern power and loyalty can never be measured until the       purpose of the war be liberty to man; for a lasting enthusiasm is       ever based on a grand idea, and unity of action demands a       definite end. At this time our greatest need is not in men or       money, valiant generals or brilliant victories, but in a       consistent policy, based on the principle that \"all governments       derive their just powers from the consent of the governed.\" And       the nation waits for you to say that there is no power under our       declaration of rights, nor under any laws, human or divine, by       which _free_ men can be made slaves; and therefore that your       pledge to the slaves is irrevocable, and shall be redeemed.         If it be true, as it is said, that Northern women lack enthusiasm       in this war, the fault rests with those who have confused and       confounded its policy. The page of history glows with incidents       of self-sacrifice by woman in the hour of her country's danger.       Fear not that the daughters of this Republic will count any       sacrifice too great to insure the triumph of freedom. Let the men       who wield the nation's power be wise, brave, and magnanimous, and       its women will be prompt to meet the duties of the hour with       devotion and heroism.         When Fremont on the Western breeze proclaimed a day of jubilee to       the bondmen within our gates, the women of the nation echoed back       a loud Amen. When Hunter freed a million men, and gave them arms       to fight our battles, justice and mercy crowned that act, and       tyrants stood appalled. When Butler, in the chief city of the       Southern despotism, hung a traitor, we felt a glow of pride; for       that one act proved that we had a Government, and one man brave       enough to administer its laws. And when Burnside would banish       Vallandigham to the Dry Tortugas, let the sentence be approved,       and the nation will ring with plaudits. Your Proclamation gives       you immortality. Be just, and share your glory with men like       these who wait to execute your will.         In behalf of the Women's National Loyal League,                                  ELIZABETH CADY STANTON, _President_.       SUSAN B. ANTHONY, _Secretary_.         Rev. ANTOINETTE BROWN BLACKWELL: Possibly there maybe nations,       like individuals, that are without definite ideas or purposes.       They sprang into being by accident, and they continue to live by       the sufferance of circumstances. Our American Republic is not of       this type. We were born to the heritage of one great idea; we       were created by it and for it, and it is mightier than we; it       must annihilate us, or it must establish us a nation as lasting       as the ages.         Our ante-revolutionary statesmen were dissatisfied with an       inadequate, partial, unjust representation. The thought grew in       them till it developed the broad principle of self-government by       the people. They perceived and asserted that truth; they fought       for it, and died or lived for it, as the case might be. So they       constructed this great Republic, grounding it firmly upon a deep       and wide democracy. Its frame-work was essentially democratic,       but there were a few great beams and joists, and plenty of paint       and mortar used, which were as purely aristocratic.         We, here at the North, have been accustomed to look at the       strength of the foundations, and of the consistent massive       frame-work; they, at the South, admired the incongruous ornaments       and decorations, and they did not forget any of the exceptional       timbers. We were shocked when the great structure seemed ready to       tumble about our ears; they expected it all the time, and were       working for it, ready to perish in the general downfall, if that       were inevitable. I have seen a drop of water spread over a small       orifice in a layer of melting ice, which was brilliant red in       color to me, but it was the intensest blue to my friend, who was       standing at my side. The moral vision is quite as largely       dependent upon the angle at which it receives its rays of       reflected light. North and South represent the extremes of the       moral spectrum. The equalizing of labor and capital, which is a       beautiful violet to us, is a very angry red to them; and the       soft-toned hues of their system of servitude are crimson with       blood-guiltiness to ourselves. If we stood where the perfect and       undivided sunbeams could fall upon us, we should see all men       under the common radiance of that pure white light, of which       Providence has an unlimited supply.         No more unanimity of sentiment or principle existed among our own       people in the war of the Revolution, than in this. Democracy,       asserting its rights, brought on the conflict then, though       aristocracy, goaded by the instinct of self-preservation and       self-interest, joined hands and aided it to its consummation.       Patriotism grew in the hearts of each, and held us together as a       nation for about eighty years; but the subordinate antagonism,       tortured by its unnatural alliance during all those years, now in       turn strikes also for independence. Predominance, precedence,       pre-eminence, might have satisfied it for a time; but, from the       nature of our institutions, that was impossible. It encroached at       every point, and was generally rewarded for its self-assertion;       but it was inherently and constitutionally subordinate, and must       have remained so forever in the federation of the United States.       It struck for independence, and it did well! It did all it could       do, if it would not die inanely. One must always admire that       instinct of the grub which leads it to weave its own       winding-sheet, and lie down fearlessly in its sepulcher,       preparatory to its resurrection as a butterfly; but immeasurably       more to be admired is the calculating courage of men who are       ready to stake their all upon any issue--even upon one so       mistaken, so false, so partial to one class and so unjust to       another, as the cause of the slave-holders. Every earnest purpose       must have its own baptism of blessings.         We, the inheritors of a sublime truth, have been grievously       wanting in faith in our heritage!--wanting in aim and purpose to       maintain its integrity! No wonder the land is still washed with       tears of the widowed and fatherless, and that stricken mothers       refuse to be comforted. Give us a living principle to die for.       \"Make this a war for emancipation!\" cries anti-slavery England,       \"and our sympathies will be with you!\" They demand much; but,       that demand granted, it yet falls infinitely below the real point       at issue. It is immeasurably short of the great conflict which we       are actually waging. It is one phase of it,--the most acute       phase, undoubtedly; but not, therefore, the broadest and most       momentous one. Slavery was the peculiar institution of the South;       but we, as a nation, have an incomparably greater peculiar       institution of our own. The one is only peculiarly exceptional to       our general policy; the other is essentially and organically at       war with it. It is the only thing which pointedly distinguishes       us from a dozen other nations. The consent of the governed is the       sole, legitimate authority of any government! This is the       essential, peculiar creed of our republic. That principle is on       one side of this war; and the old doctrine of might makes right,       the necessary ground-work of all monarchies, is on the other. It       is a life-and-death conflict between all those grand, universal,       man-respecting principles, which we call by the comprehensive       term democracy, and all those partial, person-respecting,       class-favoring elements which we group together under that       silver-slippered word aristocracy. If this war does not mean       that, it means nothing.         Slavery is malignantly aristocratic, and seems therefore to       absorb all other manifestations of the principle into itself. It       is Pharaoh's lean kine, which devour all the others of their       species, and yet are no better favored than before.

Their combined concerts are       almost invariably successes.\"    A Wooster (O.) paper, February, 1859, says,--         \"The Hutchinsons and Lucas--these two celebrated       troupes--will give together one of their unrivalled       entertainments at Arcadame Hall on Saturday evening next.       They are spoken of in the highest terms by the press in       different directions. Both troupes have been in Wooster       before; so that it is unnecessary for us to speak of them       favorably. The hall will undoubtedly be filled.\"    A Cleveland (O.) paper, Feb. 28, 1859, says,--         \"The well-known Luca family are now giving concerts in       connection with Asa B., Lizzie C., and little Freddy       Hutchinson, of the Hutchinson family; and their performances       are highly spoken of by Western exchanges. They perform in       Elyria on Tuesday evening; and will soon appear in this       city, we understand.\"    Shortly after the return of the Luca family from the tour with the  Hutchinsons, Cleveland the pianist, with a noble aim, resolved to go  to Africa. This circumstance caused the disbandment of the troupe.    Their father has resided for a long time at Zanesville, O., where,  although quite advanced in years, he is still esteemed as a vocalist,  singing in a church choir, and where he enjoys the respect of all for  his many good qualities of heart and mind.    His two sons, John and Alexander, are now, as ever, devoted to the art  of music; the former being a valuable member of the celebrated Hyer  sisters concert and dramatic troupe, while the latter is vocal  director of another company.    As a fitting close to this sketch, as a corroboration of my own  testimony, and as an evidence of the noble qualities possessed by that  rare musician and Christian gentleman, Asa B. Hutchinson, I add the  following beautiful tribute from his pen:--         GENEVA, O., Dec. 15, 1875.         In regard to our dear friends the Lucas, I am glad to state       that it was our pleasure to associate with them in public       concerts \"in the cruel days of the prejudiced past;\" and       this is our testimony: that, in all our concertizing for       thirty-five years, we never formed an alliance with any       musical people with whom we fraternized so pleasantly, and       loved so well, and who evinced so much real genuine talent       in their profession, and such courtesy and Christian culture       \"in their daily walk and conversation.\" Our dear lamented       Cleveland was a thoroughly educated pianist, and won the       enthusiastic admiration of the scientific musicians in every       city and town we visited. He executed most rapidly, at       sight, any and all of the difficult and new compositions       that were presented to him by his friends, to their       astonishment and our mutual joy; and when the three       brothers, \"Alex.,\" John, and Cleveland, united their       respective instruments and voices in one grand choral, the       effect was intensely thrilling and electrical. In some of       our concerted pieces, where they united with us, we carried       our reformatory sentiments and songs to a successful       termination; and, notwithstanding the then great and bitter       prejudice of our audiences against us all for daring thus       publicly to associate together, they cheered our combined       efforts with loud applause and frequent encores.         And now that each of our bands are broken by death, still       believing that the freed spirits of the departed loved ones       are re-united in \"singing the songs of the redeemed\" in that       realm of light, liberty, and love beyond, it is a great       satisfaction to me, a poor lingering pilgrim, to revert to       one of the sweetest experiences of our entire       concert-life,--the acquaintance and fellowship of the Luca       family.         ASA B. HUTCHINSON.          VII.    HENRY F. WILLIAMS,    COMPOSER, BAND-INSTRUCTOR, ETC.         \"Thy purpose firm is equal to the deed.\"         \"His lyre well tuned to rapturous sounds.\"      A writer in \"The Progressive American\" for July 17, 1872, said,--         \"Having occasion to visit Boston, I attended one of the       unrivalled concerts at the Coliseum, where, to my great       astonishment, I saw undoubtedly the greatest assemblage of       human beings ever congregated under one roof, and heard a       chorus of nearly or quite twenty thousand voices,       accompanied by the powerful organ and an orchestra of two       thousand musicians. I was highly delighted. But what gave me       the most pleasure was to see among some of the most eminent       artists of the world two colored artists performing their       parts in common with the others; viz., Henry F. Williams and       F.E. Lewis. Each of these was competent to play his part, or       he could not have occupied a place in the orchestra. I was       informed by the superintendent of the orchestra that both       these man were subjected to a very rigid examination prior       to the commencement of the concerts.\"    [Illustration: HENRY F. WILLIAMS.]    The pleasure afforded this writer, by witnessing our subject's  appearance on the memorable occasion referred to, was shared by  many other persons who were able to distinguish him in that vast  concourse of fine musicians. It was not so easy to distinguish him  from the others by his complexion as it was by his dignified, graceful  appearance. Of this, as well as of Mr. Williams's musical skill, the  organizer of the great orchestra, Mr. Baldwin, has, since the event,  spoken to me in terms the most complimentary. He said it was not more  Mr. Williams's good playing, than his handsome, manly appearance in  the orchestra, that afforded him pleasure; and that in both of these  particulars Mr. Williams stood in favorable contrast with many other  members of the orchestra. This was high praise indeed, but no higher  than its recipient deserved, as all will testify who know him.    As stated in the extract just quoted, Mr. Williams, before being  accepted as a member of the Jubilee orchestra, was subjected to a  severe test; being required to execute on the double-bass the parts  written for that instrument in the celebrated overture from \"William  Tell,\" and also in Wagner's difficult \"Tannhaeuser.\" In regard to this  test Mr. Baldwin has since said to the writer, \"I myself had no doubts  as to Mr. Williams's ability as a musician. My object in arranging the  test performance was, that I might afterwards point to its successful  result, and thus silence many of the instrumentalists that came from  other parts of the country, in case they should object (I knew that  many of them would do so), on the weak ground of _color_, to playing  with Mr. Williams. Neither Mr. Gilmore nor myself knew any man by the  color of his face. What we wanted for the grand orchestra was _good  musicians_, and, when any one objected to our two colored performers,  we triumphantly referred to the exacting and satisfactory test they  had undergone as sufficient answer to the foolish clamors of all those  afflicted with 'color-phobia.' Seeing the managers of the Jubilee thus  resolved, and convinced that the two colored men were artistic  performers,--superior in ability to many with whom they were to be  associated,--no one declined to play; and all was harmony thereafter.\"    And here I may be permitted to record the thanks of all well-meaning  people for the noble action of Messrs. Gilmore and Baldwin. The two  artists mentioned were not the only members of their race who took a  part in the memorable Jubilee concerts. Several others in a vocal way  occupied even prominent positions at these concerts. Some sang as  artists on the stage, and several were members of that great chorus of  nearly twenty thousand voices. In all these places they did their  share in making the occasion a grand success, while they justified  fully the wisdom of those by whom they were invited to participate.  The action of the latter was no more than what was due and right, it  is true; but it is well to remember (for we must take things as we  find them) that Messrs. Gilmore and Baldwin were not obliged to engage  these persons. Had the former not been men of pure principles and  firmness, they might have yielded to the mean and by far too popular  prejudice entertained against colored people, and have refused to  allow them to take part in the performances. That they did not thus  yield is much to their credit as musicians and gentlemen; and they are  to be thanked, I say, for their manly action.    The little ripple of excitement caused by Mr. Williams's appearance  among the musicians of the Jubilee might well have provoked from that  gentleman a smile of contempt; for he was a far older and much more  skilful performer than many who at first objected to playing with him.  He had, indeed, more than thirty years of musical experience behind  him,--years which were full of manly, persevering struggle against  great odds, and years during which he had many times triumphed over  opposition far greater than that met by him at the Coliseum. Born in  Boston Aug. 13, 1813, beginning his studies when but seven years of  age, he had, mainly by his own efforts (he is in the truest sense a  \"self-made man\"), become a thorough musician; was a superior performer  on the violin, double-bass, and the cornet; a fair performer on the  viola, violoncello, baritone, trombone, tuba, and piano-forte; having  been besides for years an esteemed teacher of most of these  instruments. Nor did his musical powers stop here; for in addition to  being a skilful arranger of music for the instruments just mentioned,  and others, he was a composer, many of whose works bore the imprint of  several of the most eminent music publishers of the day. Learning  these facts, no wonder that those who at first opposed Mr. Williams's"]]]
