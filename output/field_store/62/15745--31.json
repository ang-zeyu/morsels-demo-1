But these oracles were to be  restored to them again; and _then_ they would triumph over their  enemies, and regain their rights and privileges. Mr. Boudinot, after  recording many traditions similar to the above, at length remarks:  \"Can any man read this short account of Indian traditions, drawn from  tribes of various nations; from the west to the east, and from the  south to the north, wholly separated from each other, written by  different authors of the best character, both for knowledge and  integrity, possessing the best means of information, at various and  distant times, without any possible communication with each other; and  yet suppose that all this is the effect of chance, accident, or  design, from a love of the marvelous, or a premeditated intention of  deceiving, and thereby ruining their well established reputation? Can  any one carefully, and with deep reflection, consider and compare  these traditions and nations with the position and circumstances of  the long lost ten tribes of Israel, without at least drawing some  presumptive inferences in favor of these wandering natives being  descended from the ten tribes of Israel?\"    \"Joseph Merrick, Esq., a highly respectable character in Pitsfield,  Mass., gave the following account: That in 1815, he was leveling some  ground under and near an old wood-shed standing on a place of his,  situated on _Indian Hill_. He ploughed and conveyed away old chips and  earth to some depth. After the work was done, walking over the place,  he discovered, near where the earth had been dug the deepest, a black  strap, as it appeared, about six inches in length, and one and a half  in breadth, and about the thickness of a leather trace to a harness.  He perceived it had, at each end, a loop of some hard substance,  probably for the purpose of carrying it. He conveyed it to his house,  and threw it into an old tool box. He afterwards found it thrown out  at the door, and again conveyed it to the box.    \"After some time, he thought he would examine it; but in attempting to  cut it, found it as hard as bone; he succeeded, however, in getting it  open, and found it was formed of two pieces of thick rawhide, sewed  and made water-tight with the sinews of some animal, and gummed over;  and in the fold was contained _four_ folded pieces of parchment. They  were of a dark yellow hue, and contained some kind of writing. The  neighbors coming in to see the strange discovery, tore one of the  pieces to atoms, in the true Hun and Vandal style. The other three  pieces Mr. Merrick saved, and sent them to Cambridge, where they were  examined, and discovered to have been written with a pen, in _Hebrew_,  plain and legible. The writing on the three remaining pieces of  parchment, was quotations from the Old Testament. See Deut., vi, from  4--9; also xi, 13--21; and Exodus, xiii, 11--16, to which the reader  can refer, if he has the curiosity to read this most interesting  discovery.    \"On the banks of White River, in Arkansas Territory, have been found  ruins erected no doubt by an enlightened population, of the most  extraordinary character, on account of their dimensions, and the  materials of which they were erected. One of these works is a wall of  earth, which encloses an area of six hundred and forty acres, equal to  a mile square, and having, in its centre, the foundation of a large  circular building, or temple. Another, yet more strange, and more  extensive, consists of the foundations of a great city, whose streets,  crossing each other at right angles, are easily traced through the  mighty forest. And besides these are found the foundations of  _houses_, made of _burnt_ bricks, like the bricks of the present time.  These have been traced to the extent of a mile.\"    The foregoing is taken from Priest's American Antiquities, and from  the same work we extract the following, page 246:    \"_Ruins of the City of Otolum, discovered in North America_.--In a  letter of C. S. Rafinesque, whom we have before quoted, to a  correspondent in Europe, we find the following: 'Some years ago, the  Society of Geography, in Paris, offered a large premium for a voyage  to Guatemala, and for a new survey of the antiquities of Yucatan and  Chiapa, chiefly those fifteen miles from Palenque.'\"    \"I have,\" says this author, \"restored to them the true name of  _Otolum_, which is yet the name of the stream running through the  ruins. They were surveyed by Captain Del Rio, in 1787, an account of  which was published in English, in 1822. This account describes partly  the ruins of a _stone_ city, of no less dimensions than seventy-five  miles in circuit; length, thirty-two, and breadth twelve miles, full  of palaces, monuments, statues, and inscriptions: one of the earliest  seats of American civilization; about equal to Thebes of ancient  Egypt.\"    It is stated in the _Family Magazine_, No. 34, p. 266, for 1833, as  follows: \"Public attention has been recently excited, respecting the  ruins of an ancient city, found in Guatemala. It would seem that these  ruins are now being explored, and much curious and valuable matter, in  a literary and historical point of view, is anticipated. We deem the  present a most auspicious moment, now that the public attention is  turned to the subject, to spread its contents before our readers, as  an introduction to future discoveries, during the researches now in  progress.\"    The following are some of the particulars, as related by Captain Del  Rio, who partially examined them, as above related, in 1787: \"From  Palenque, the last town northward in the province of _Ciudad Real de  Chiapa_, taking a southwesterly direction, and ascending a ridge of  high land, that divides the kingdom of Guatemala from Yucatan, at the  distance of six miles, is the little river _Micol_, whose waters flow  in a westerly direction, and unite with the great river _Tulijah_,  which bends its course towards the province of _Tobasco_. Having  passed Micol, the ascent begins, and at half a league, or a mile and a  half, the traveler crosses a little stream called Otolum; from this  point heaps of stone ruins are discovered, which render the roads very  difficult for another half league, when you gain the height whereon  the stone houses are situated, being still fourteen in number in one  place, some more dilapidated than others, yet still having many of  their apartments perfectly discernible. These stand on a rectangular  area, three hundred yards in breadth by four hundred and fifty in  length, which is a fraction over fifty-six rods wide, and eighty-four  rods long, being in the whole circuit, two hundred and eighty rods,  which is three fourths of a mile, and a trifle over. This area  presents a plain at the base of the highest mountain forming the  ridge. In the centre of this plain is situated the largest of the  structures which has been, as yet, discovered among these ruins. It  stands on a mound, or pyramid, twenty yards high, which is sixty feet,  or nearly four rods, in perpendicular altitude, which gives it a lofty  and beautiful majesty, as if it were a temple suspended in the sky.  This is surrounded by other edifices, namely, five to the northward,  four to the southward, one to the southwest, and three to the  eastward, fourteen in all.    \"In all directions, the fragments of other fallen buildings are seen  extending along the mountain, that stretches east and west either way  from these buildings, as if it were the great temple of worship, or  their government-house, around which they built their city, and where  dwelt their kings and officers of state. At this place was found a  subterranean stone aqueduct, of great solidity and durability, which  in its course passes beneath the largest building.\"    Let it be understood, this city of Otolum, the ruins of which are so  immense, is in North, not South America, in the same latitude with the  island of Jamaica, which is about eighteen degrees north of the  equator, being on the highest ground between the northern end of the  Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean, where the continent narrows  towards the Isthmus of Darien, and is about eight hundred miles south  of New Orleans.    The discovery of these ruins, and also of many others, equally  wonderful, in the same country, is just commencing to arouse the  attention of the schools of Europe, which hitherto have denied that  America could boast of her antiquities. But these immense ruins are  now being explored under the direction of scientific persons, a  history of which, in detail, will, doubtless, be forthcoming in due  time; two volumes of which, in manuscript, we are informed, have  already been written, and cannot but be received with enthusiasm by  Americans.    A gentleman who was living near the town of Cincinnati, in 1826, on  the upper level, had occasion to sink a well for his accommodation; he  persevered in digging to the depth of eighty feet, without finding  water; but still persisting in the attempt, his workmen found  themselves obstructed by a substance, which resisted their labor,  though evidently not stone. They cleared the surface and sides from  the earth bedded around it, when there appeared the stump of a tree,  three feet in diameter, and two feet high, which had been cut down  with an ax. The blows of the ax were yet visible. It was nearly of the  color and apparent character of coal, but had not the friable and  fusible quality of that substance. Ten feet below, the water sprang  up, and the well is now in constant supply and high repute.    In Morse's Universal Geography, first volume, p. 142, the discovery of  the stump is corroborated: \"In digging a well in Cincinnati, the stump  of a tree was found in a sound state, ninety feet below the surface;  and in digging "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3567"],[0,"Memoirs of Napoleon Bonaparte — Complete (#20)"],[1,"anded, and they did not obtain their freedom till the  end of August. There was no article in the treaty, public or secret,  which had reference to them. Neither was it at his own suggestion that  Bonaparte demanded the enlargement of the prisoners, but by order of the  Directory. To explain why they did not go to France immediately after  their liberation from Olmutz, it is necessary to recollect that the  events of the 18th Fructidor occurred between the period when the  first steps were taken to procure their liberty and the date of their  deliverance. It required all Bonaparte's ascendency and vigour of  character to enable him to succeed in his object at the end of three  months.    We had arrived at the month of July, and the negotiations were tediously  protracted. It was impossible to attribute the embarrassment which was  constantly occurring to anything but the artful policy of Austria:  Other affairs occupied Bonaparte. The news from Paris engrossed all  his attention. He saw with extreme displeasure the manner in which the  influential orators of the councils, and pamphlets written in the same  spirit as they spoke, criticised him, his army, his victories, the  affairs of Venice, and the national glory. He was quite indignant at  the suspicions which it was sought to create respecting his conduct and  ulterior views.    The following excerpts, attributed to the pens of Dumouriez or Rivarol,  are specimens of some of the comments of the time:         EXTRACTS OF LETTERS IN \"LE SPECTATUER DU NORD\" of 1797.       General Bonaparte is, without contradiction, the most brilliant     warrior who has appeared at the head of the armies of the French     Republic. His glory is incompatible with democratic equality, and     the services he has rendered are too great to be recompensed except     by hatred and ingratitude. He is very young, and consequently has     to pursue a long career of accusations and of persecutions.       ........Whatever may be the crowning event of his military career,     Bonaparte is still a great man. All his glory is due to himself     alone; because he alone has developed a character and a genius of     which no one else has furnished an example.         EXTRACT OF LETTER OR 18TH APRIL 1797 in \"THE SPECTATEUR DU NORD.\"       Regard, for instance, this wretched war. Uncertain in Champagne, it     becomes daring under Dumouriez, unbridled under the brigands who     fought the Vendeeans, methodic under Pichegru, vulgar under Jourdan,     skilled under Moreau, rash under Bonaparte. Each general has put     the seal of his genius on his career, and has given life or death to     his army. From the commencement of his career Bonaparte has     developed an ardent character which is irritated by obstacles, and a     quickness which forestalls every determination of the enemy. It is     with heavier and heavier blows that, he strikes. He throws his army     on the enemy like an unloosed torrent. He is all action, and he is     so in everything. See him fight, negotiate, decree, punish, all is     the matter of a moment. He compromises with Turin as with Rome. He     invades Modena as he burns Binasco. He never hesitates; to cut the     Gordian knot is always his method.    Bonaparte could not endure to have his conduct predicated; and enraged  at seeing his campaigns depreciated, his glory and that of his army  disparaged,         --[The extraordinary folly of the opposition to the Directory in     throwing Bonaparte on to the side of the Directory, will be seen by     reading the speech of Dumolard, so often referred to by Bourrienne     (Thiers, vol. v. pp. 110-111), and by the attempts of Mathieu Dumas     to remove the impression that the opposition slighted the fortunate     General. (See Dumas, tome iii. p. 80; see also Lanfrey, tome i.     pp. 257-299).]--    and intrigues formed against him in the Club of Clichy, he wrote the  following letter to the Directory:--         TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORY.       I have just received, Citizens-Directors, a copy of the motion of     Dumolard (23d June 1797).       This motion, printed by order of the Assembly, it is evident, is     directed against me. I was entitled, after, having five times     concluded peace, and given a death-blow to the coalition, if not to     civic triumphs, at least to live tranquilly under the protection of     the first magistrates of the Republic. At present I find myself     ill-treated, persecuted, and disparaged, by every shameful means,     which their policy brings to the aid of persecution. I would have     been indifferent to all except that species of opprobrium with which     the first magistrates of the Republic endeavour to overwhelm me.     After having deserved well of my country by my last act, I am not     bound to hear myself accused in a manner as absurd as atrocious.     I have not expected that a manifesto, signed by emigrants, paid by     England, should obtain more credit with the Council of Five Hundred     than the evidence of eighty thousand men--than mine! What! we were     assassinated by traitors--upwards of four hundred men perished; and     the first magistrates of the Republic make it a crime to have     believed the statement for a moment. Upwards of four hundred     Frenchmen were dragged through the streets. They were assassinated     before the eyes of the governor of the fort. They were pierced with     a thousand blows of stilettos, such as I sent you and the     representatives of the French people cause it to be printed, that if     they believed this fact for an instant, they were excusable. I know     well there are societies where it is said, \"Is this blood, then, so     pure?\"       If only base men, who are dead to the feeling of patriotism and     national glory, had spoken of me thus, I would not have complained.     I would have disregarded it; but I have a right to complain of the     degradation to which the first magistrates of the Republic reduce     those who have aggrandised, and carried the French name to so high a     pitch of glory. Citizens-Directors, I reiterate the demand I made     for my dismissal; I wish to live in tranquillity, if the poniards of     Clichy will allow me to live. You have employed me in negotiations.     I am not very fit to conduct them.    About the same time he drew up the following note respecting the affairs  of Venice, which was printed without the author's name, and circulated  through the whole army:--                       NOTE.       Bonaparte, pausing before the gates of Turin, Parma, Rome, and     Vienna, offering peace when he was sure of obtaining nothing but     fresh triumphs--Bonaparte, whose every operation exhibits respect     for religion, morality, and old age; who, instead of heaping, as he     might have done, dishonour upon the Venetians, and humbling their     republic to the earth, loaded her with acts of kindness, and took     such great interest in her glory--is this the same Bonaparte who is     accused of destroying the ancient Government of Venice, and     democratising Genoa, and even of interfering in the affairs of the     prudent and worthy people of the Swiss Cantons? Bonaparte had     passed the Tagliamento, and entered Germany, when insurrections     broke out in the Venetian States; these insurrections were,     therefore, opposed to Bonaparte's project; surely, then, he could     not favour them. When he was in the heart of Germany the Venetians     massacred more than four hundred French troops, drove their quarters     out of Verona, assassinated the unfortunate Laugier, and presented     the spectacle of a fanatical party in arms. He returned to Italy;     and on his arrival, as the winds cease their agitation at the     presence of Neptune, the whole of Italy, which was in commotion,     which was in arms, was restored to order.       However, the deputies from Bonaparte drew up different articles     conformable to the situation of the country, and in order to     prevent, not a revolution in the Government, for the Government was     defunct, and had died a natural death, but a crisis, and to save the     city from convulsion, anarchy, and pillage. Bonaparte spared a     division of his army to save Venice from pillage and massacre. All     the battalions were in the streets of Venice, the disturbers were     put down, and the pillage discontinued. Property and trade were     preserved, when General Baragney d'Hilliers entered Venice with his     division. Bonaparte, as usual, spared blood, and was the protector     of Venice. Whilst the French troops remained they conducted     themselves peaceably, and only interfered to support the provisional     Government.       Bonaparte could not say to the deputies of Venice, who came to ask     his protection and assistance against the populace, who wished to     plunder them, \"I cannot meddle with your affairs.\" He could not say     this, for Venice, and all its territories, had really formed the     theatre of war; and, being in the rear of the army of Italy, the     Republic of Venice was really under the jurisdiction of that army.     The rights of war confer upon a general the powers of supreme police     over the countries which are the seat of war. As the great     Frederick said, \"There are no neutrals where there is war.\"     Ignorant advocates and babblers have asked, in the Club of Clichy,     why we occupy the territory of Venice. These declaimers should     learn war, and they would know that the Adige, the Brenta, and the     Tagliamento, where we have been fighting for two years, are within     the Venetian States. But, gentlemen of Clichy, we are at no loss to     perceive your meaning. You reproach the army of Italy for having     surmounted all difficulties--for subduing all Italy for having twice     passed the Alps--for having marched on Vienna, and obliged Austria     to acknowledge the Republic that, you,"]]]
