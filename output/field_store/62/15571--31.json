The supposed son is of  course received with every demonstration of affection by his fond  parent, but though submitting with a very good grace to the endearments  of his supposed sister--the maiden, with whom he had fallen in love so  suddenly--he resolutely declines being hugged and made much of by the  old landlord, this double-part being entirely distasteful to his  straightforward nature.  Nor does his affianced bride, the daughter of  the bailiff, fare any better, his affections being placed elsewhere,  and their bewilderment is only somewhat appeased by Schwarzbart's  explanation that his comrade suffers occasionally from weakness of the  brain.    In the next act Peter, a youth of marvellous stupidity and cousin of  the bailiff, presents himself in a woful plight, to which he has been  reduced by some soldiers at the same wedding festivities, and shortly  after Gustav, the real son appears on the scene.  He is a manly fellow,  full of tender {113} thoughts for his home.  Great is therefore his  surprise at finding himself repulsed by his own father, who not  recognizing him, believes him to be an impostor.  All the young man's  protestations are of no avail, for in his knapsack are found the papers  of a certain Wilhelm Stark, for whom he is now mistaken.--When silly  Peter perceives him, he believes him to be the Grenadier, who had so  ill-treated him at the wedding, though in reality it was Schwarzbart.  Gustav is shut up in a large garden-house of his father's; the small  town lacking a prison.    In the third act the Magistrate has found out that Wilhelm's papers  prove him to be the bailiff's son, being the offspring of his first  love ----, who had been with a clergyman, and who, after the death of  the bailiff's wife is vainly sought for by his father.  Of course this  changes everything for the prisoner, who is suddenly accosted  graciously by his gruff guardian Barsch, and does not know what to make  of his mysterious hints.    Meanwhile Caroline's heart has spoken for the stranger, who had  addressed her so courteously and chivalrously; she feels that, far from  being an impostor, he is a loyal and true-hearted young fellow and  therefore decides to liberate him.  At the same time enter Wilhelm with  Schwarzbart, seeking Suschen; Peter slips in for the same reason,  seeking her, for Suschen is to be his bride.  Gustav, (the prisoner)  hearing footsteps, blows out the candle, in order to save Caroline from  being recognized {114} and so they all run about in the dark, playing  hide and seek in an infinitely droll manner.  At last the bailiff,  having heard that his son has been found, comes up with the  inn-keeper.--The whole mystery is cleared up, and both sons embrace  their respective fathers and their brides.          HAMLET.    Grand Opera in five acts by AMBROISE THOMAS.    Text taken from SHAKESPEARE by MICHEL CARRE and JULES BARBIER.      Hamlet was first reproduced in Paris in 1868, a year after the  representation of Mignon, but it never reached the latter's popularity.  This is not due to the music, which is very fine, and even nobler than  in Mignon, but to the horrid mutilation of Shakespeare's glorious  tragedy, which almost turns into ridicule the most sublime thoughts.    The text is soon explained.  We find the Shakespearean name with their  thoughts and deeds turned into operatic jargon.    The first act shows Hamlet's disgust and pain at his mother's early  wedding with Claudius, King of Denmark, only two months after her first  husband's death.  Ophelia vainly tries to divert his somber thoughts,  he finds her love very sweet however, and when her brother Laertes,  before starting on a long journey commends her to his friends'  protection, Hamlet swears to be true to her unto death.    In the interview at midnight with his father's ghost, Hamlet  experiences great revulsion of feeling, when he discovers that his  mother's second {115} husband, is his father's murderer.  The ghost  urges Hamlet, to avenge his parent, which he swears to do.    In the second act we find Hamlet quite changed.  He not only avoids his  father and mother, but also shuns Ophelia, who vainly tries to  understand his strange behaviour.  Determined to find out the truth  about Claudius' guilt, Hamlet has paid some actor, to play the old  tragedy of Gonzaga's murder.  When the actor pours the poison into the  sleeping King's mouth Claudius sinks back half fainting, and Hamlet,  keenly observant, loudly accuses him of his father's death.  But he is  unable to act and after the King's escape he seeks his mother's room to  ponder on his wrongs.  Hidden behind a pillar he overhears from  Claudius' own lips that Ophelia's father, old Polonius is the King's  accomplice.  This destroys the last spark of his belief in humanity.  Thrusting the weeping Ophelia from him, he advises her to shut herself  into convent and to bid farewell to all earthly joys.  Left alone with  his mother he wildly reproaches her, and at last so far forgets  himself, that he is about to kill her, had not his father's ghost  appeared once more, exhorting him to take vengeance but to spare his  mother.    This scene is very powerful, the music of strange and weird beauty.--    In the fourth act poor demented Ophelia takes part in the plays of the  village-maidens.  The Swedish song she sings to them is full of sweet  pathos.  When her playmates leave her, she hides {116} among the  willows, enticed into the water by the \"Neck\" (Swedish for Sirens),  whose own song she has sung.  Slowly floating out on the waves her  voice dies away softly.  With her death the interest in the opera ends;  however a fifth act takes us to her grave, where the whole funeral  procession arrives.  The ghost once more appeals to Hamlet for  vengeance, until he rouses himself and runs his sword through Claudius,  after which the ghost disappears, while Hamlet is elected King of  Denmark on the spot.    The audience in German theatres is spared this last piece of absurdity  and the play is brought to a more appropriate close by Hamlet's  stabbing himself on his bride's bier.          HANSEL AND GRETEL.    A Fairytale in three pictures by ADELHEID WETTE.    Music by ENGELBERT HUMPERDINCK.      After a long period of \"Sturm und Drang\" we have an opera so fresh and  simple, that any child will delight in it!  It not only captivates  children and people of simple tastes; but, the most blases must  acknowledge its charms.  No thrilling drama, but a simple fairytale,  known in every nursery has achieved this wonder.  It is a revelation.  True music finds its way to the hearts, and how wonderfully refreshing  are these simple nursery songs, recalling days of sweet childhood, how  droll and truly realistic are these children in {117} their natural and  naive sauciness!  Here is no display of human passions; simply and  clearly the old fairytale goes on, embellished by the masterly way in  which the musician handles the modern orchestra.    The first act represents the miserable little hut of a broom-maker.  Hansel is occupied in binding brooms, Gretel is knitting and singing  old nursery-songs, such as \"Susy, dear Susy, what rattles in the  straw.\"  Both children are very hungry, and wait impatiently for the  arrival of their parents.  Hansel is particularly bad-tempered, but the  merry and practical Gretel finding some milk in a pot, soon soothes his  ruffled feelings by the promise of a nice rice-pap in the evening.  Forgetting work and hunger, they begin to dance and frolic, until they  roll on the ground together.  At this moment their mother enters, and  seeing the children idle, her wrath is kindled, and she rushes at them  with the intention of giving them a sound whipping.  Alas instead of  Hansel she strikes the pot and upsets the milk.  The mother's vexation  cools and only sorrow remains, but she quickly puts a little basket  into Gretel's hands, and drives the children away, bidding them look  for strawberries in the woods.  Then sinking on a chair utterly  exhausted, she falls asleep.  She is awakened by her husband, who comes  in singing and very gay.  She sees that he has had a drop too much and  is about to reproach him, but the words die on her lips, when she sees  him unfold his treasures, consisting of eggs, bread, butter and coffee.  He tells her that he has {118} been very fortunate at the church-ale  (Kirmes), and bids her prepare supper at once.  Alas, the pot is  broken, and the mother relates, that finding the children idle, anger  got the better of her, and the pot was smashed to pieces.  He  goodnaturedly laughs at her discomfiture, but his merriment is changed  to grief, when he hears that their children are still in the forest,  perhaps even near the Ilsenstein, where the wicked fairy lives, who  entices children in order to bake and devour them.  This thought so  alarms the parents that they rush off, to seek the children in the  forest.    The second act is laid near the ill-famed Ilsenstein.  Hansel has  filled his basket with strawberries, and Gretel is winding a garland of  red hips, with which Hansel crowns her.  He presents her also with a  bunch of wild flowers and playfully does homage to this queen of the  woods.  Gretel enjoying the play, pops one berry after another into her  brother's mouth; then they both eat, while listening to the cuckoo.  Before they are aware of it, they have eaten the whole contents of the  basket and observe with terror, that it has grown too dark, either to  look for a fresh supply, or to find their way home.  Gretel begins to  weep and to call for her parents, but Hansel, rallying his courage,  takes her in his arms and soothes her, until they both grow sleepy.

I should have liked _The Flood_  better if it had had more living figures and less papier mache, though I  am not ashamed to admit that I have no idea how this could have been  done.  Shakespeare himself, who apologizes for trying to make a cockpit  hold the vasty fields of France, might have been excused for not  attempting to decant The Universal Deluge into a receptacle scarcely  bigger than a costermonger's barrow.  Of the three remaining cars, _Sin_  was beyond comparison the finest both in conception and execution.  Perhaps he would have looked the part more obviously if he had had more  of a once-aboard-the-lugger expression on his kind and gentle face; on  the other hand, the designer of this car may have intended that Sin is  most successful in seducing the righteous when he appears with nothing  repulsive in his aspect.  The other two were merely just what they should  have been--ordinary business cars, so to speak.  Had these three single  figures appeared on horseback with grooms to lead them, as in former  times, the procession would have gained in variety and the importance of  the groups on the cars would have been emphasized.    But this is a small matter.  The procession as it was, with its car after  car jolting along under an August full moon, the sparkling of the jewels,  the flashing of the torches, the blazing of the gas, the beauty of the  figures and the immense multitude of reverent worshippers made up a scene  never to be forgotten.  The impressiveness was deepened by the knowledge  that this Mountain, where Astarte, Aphrodite and Venus have all reigned  in turn, is also a place where much that has helped to mould the poetry  and history of the world has happened since the Sicans first girded it  with its megalithic cincture.  Added to this was the conviction that for  many and many an age some such procession has been winding through these  narrow, irregular streets, the form changing, but the intention remaining  ever the same--Praise to the Giver of the Increase.    The programme for the next day contained nothing till 5 p.m., when there  were more horse-races, then Vespers in the Matrice, brilliantly  illuminated; after dusk fireworks outside the Trapani Gate, and at night  a concert in the illuminated balio.    In the afternoon of Wednesday, the 28th, a procession of fifty-nine mules  and horses passed through the town.  Each animal was accompanied by its  owner, a peasant of the comune, and was loaded with bags of grain, an  offering for the Madonna.  This grain was to be sold and, in the mean  time, was estimated to be worth 2500 lire.  About 1500 lire was collected  during the festa, partly at the church doors and partly in the value of  unused wax candles, and the municipio gave 1000, so that altogether the  receipts were about 5000 lire.  Against this the expenses of the festa  were expected to amount to about 4000 lire, and the balance will go  towards the expenses of the next.        CHAPTER XI--THE RETURN      The procession of the grain closed the harvest home and in the evening of  the same day began the proceedings relating to the Return of the Madonna  to Custonaci.  At 8 p.m. another procession started.  First came the band  to clear the way, then a man beating a drum; this is a feature of  Sicilian processions and is said to date from the time when the Saracens  had possession of the island; it continues as long as the procession  lasts, which may be for hours, and produces an unexpected effect.  There  is so much else going on that after a time you forget to notice it.  But  you have not really got away from it; you are being unconsciously  saturated, and after the festa is over you become aware that you are  suffering from a surfeit of drum; the rhythm runs in your head and keeps  you awake at night; when you go out of doors you expect to hear it in the  distance; when you turn a corner you listen for it, and as it is not  there you find yourself listening for it all the more anxiously.  But  this wears off after two or three days.    Behind the drum came peasants walking two and two, carrying candles and  an occasional banner; then the Society of the Misericordia, wearing those  mysterious dresses that cover them entirely from head to foot, with holes  for the eyes; then priests and men with lamps, and, lastly, the sacred  picture out of the Matrice, carried by men, the whole frame quivering  with its fringes of jewellery.  Every few yards the procession stopped,  partly to rest the bearers and partly to give the crowd an opportunity of  seeing the picture.    Every church that lay on the route was lighted up and not till long past  midnight, when the picture had been taken into each one of them to pay a  farewell visit, was it carried back to the Matrice.    On Thursday, 29th, the day appointed for transporting the picture back to  Custonaci, there was early Mass in the Matrice, where there was not  nearly room for all the people, and after Mass a short sermon.  The  preacher contrasted the sadness of the present occasion with the joy of  that happy day in 1893 when the Madonna had come to dwell among them,  bringing the rain with her.  He told them of her love for her people, of  all she had done for them, of all they owed her and of how deeply she  entered into the life of each one of them.  He reminded them that the  first name they had been taught to lisp at their mother's knee was Maria;  that she to whom they raised their prayers in time of tribulation was  Maria; that the one they blessed for benefits received was always Maria.  And now her gracious presence was to depart from her beloved Mountain;  the time had come to utter the last farewell.  Here the preacher spoke a  few words so touching in their eloquence that all the women and most of  the men burst into tears and made no attempt to conceal their emotion.    It would not occur to an Englishman to weep because a picture is taken  from one place to another.  Not so long ago quite a number of pictures  were taken and put away in the Tate Gallery, and yet London looked  stolidly on and not a tear was shed.  Had one been shed, it would have  been laughed at; and had only one or two of the congregation in the  Matrice been so powerfully affected, it might have passed unnoticed, but  the simultaneousness and spontaneity of their almost hysterical grief was  very impressive, and no one could have had any idea of laughing who saw  the weeping crowd that accompanied the Madonna out of the church while  the band played a funeral march.  She was carried on men's shoulders, her  face constantly turned towards the town, through the Trapani gate and  down the road to the little church of Santa Maria delle Grazie, while the  drum went in front, filling the air with the mournfulness of its  perpetual rhythm.  As the picture passed among the people one of the  women cried out--    \"See how pale the face of the Madonna has become; it is with sorrow to  leave the Mountain.\"    Another lifted up her voice and prayed that it might not be long before a  calamity befell the comune--as that it might not rain till December, for  example--in order that she might soon return.  The bearers stopped at the  little church, where a large chest had been prepared in which she was to  repose during the rest of the journey, and the people's grief culminated  as the chest received her out of their sight.    In _The Marriage of Heaven and Hell_, Blake tells us that, when the  Prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel dined with him, he asked, \"Does a firm  persuasion that a thing is so make it so?\" and Isaiah replied, \"All poets  believe that it does, and in ages of imagination this firm persuasion  removed mountains; but many are not capable of a firm persuasion of  anything.\"  Certainly most of the Ericini are capable of a firm  persuasion of something and probably, if Blake could have visited them at  a time when the Madonna was going away from the mountain or coming back  to it, he would have agreed that the age of imagination still lingers in  this classic spot.    Those who did not accompany the picture beyond Santa Maria delle Grazie  now proceeded to the balio, and the beating of the drum floated up  continuously as the chest, followed by an immense crowd on foot, in  carts, and on horseback, was carried down the zigzags and along the  winding road to Custonaci.  In many places booths had been erected, where  wine and bread were given freely to all while the bearers rested.  At  other points were pulpits, and here they stopped to listen to a short  sermon.  A crowd had come out from Paparella to meet and join the throng,  other crowds from Fico, Ragosia, Crocevia, Palazzolo and the other  villages forming the comune, were waiting at various points along the  road.  From the balio the whole journey was visible, except when the  windings of the road hid part of the crowd, and, with the help of  glasses, the arrival at the sanctuary could be seen distinctly at about 5  p.m., nearly nine hours after the morning start.  On ordinary occasions  the journey takes about three hours.  In the evening there were fireworks  and illuminations at Custonaci and bonfires in many of the other  villages.    When the picture is on the mountain it is the custom for the women of the  town to go to the Matrice in the evening to pray.  When it is at  Custonaci they go to the balio, where a stone prie-Dieu has been built  for them from which they can see the sanctuary.  Here they will go and  pray every evening until such time as the next calamity brings the  picture up among them again.
