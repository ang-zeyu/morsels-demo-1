With the  Greeks the entablature was useful, as they had no round arch; and the  Romans, just as they borrowed Greek forms and Greek metres for their  native Italian literature, in a like spirit borrowed their  entablature. It is not necessary, and Freeman calls it a mere  _stilt_.[92] The earliest instance we know of its disuse is in the  colonnade of the great hall of Diocletian's palace at Spalatro. The  greater space of the west severy is diminished by the introduction of  detached columns, so that the arches may all be of a like span. These  columns, coupled and placed in front of the lesser pilasters, are of  white veined marble, and exceedingly graceful. As the arches more  immediately rest upon them than upon the pilasters, the Roman use of  the entablature as a stilt can be here more clearly seen. I may add  that in the church of St. Apollinare Nuovo, at Ravenna, the pillars  have only blocks above their capitals, instead of the old entablature  reaching from column to column; and this church, built about 500  A.D., accordingly represents the Transition stage between the  Roman proper and the Romanesque.    Turning next from underneath the arches, and taking our stand in the  central aisle, we are in a position to notice the details of the main  entablature above the arches. The keystones are ornamented with heads  and other pieces of sculpture. As Wren employed so few arches they  rise to a great height, and of the different members of the  entablature which rests upon the Corinthian capitals of the greater  pilasters, part had to be cut away. The crowns of the arches take a  great piece out of the architrave, and their keystones reach well  within the plain and narrow frieze. Only the cornice of the first  stage remains intact, and this runs round the four limbs of the church  like a string course in any Romanesque or Gothic building.    =The Triforium Belt.=--This used to be called the \"Attic,\" in  imitation of the Classical nomenclature; but surely this term is  incorrect, since there is a clerestory above, and the vaulting springs  from it as well. On the other hand, \"Triforium\" pure and simple  implies arcading, and the above term is adopted from Fergusson as less  open to exception.[93] In continuation of the greater pilasters are  abutment piers, from the summits of which spring the great arches  spanning the nave, the window arches of the clerestory, and the  pendentives which connect these with the vaulting. The blank fronts  between the piers are relieved by panels, but otherwise destitute of  adornment. Openings connect the nave with the galleries behind.    =The Clerestory.=--This stage again calls for little or no comment.  The windows, hidden from the exterior by the curtain wall, are  slightly rounded. Above and on either side are sections of spheres,  ornamented with festoons. These are the ends of elliptic cylinders in  connection with the vaulting.    =The Vaulting.=--The great arches overhead divide the vault as the  greater pilasters and their continuations do the walls. Between these  arches are the small saucer-shaped domes, 26 feet in diameter. The  reason for these and their accessories, the pendentives, may best be  understood from Wren's own words. He says that his method of vaulting  is the most geometrical, and \"_is composed of Hemispheres, and their  Sections only; and whereas a Sphere may be cut all Manner of Ways, and  that still into Circles ... I have for just Reasons followed this way  in the Vaulting of the Church of St. Paul's.... It is the lightest  Manner, and requires less Butment than the Cross-vaulting, as well  that it is of an agreeable View.... Vaulting by Parts of Hemispheres I  have therefore followed in the Vaultings of St. Paul's, and with good  reason preferred it above any other way used by Architects._\"[94] The  saucer-shaped domes are sections of spheres, as are both the  pendentives and the sides of the clerestory windows. He set to work  something in this way. After satisfying himself that he had hit on a  better plan than the plain cylindrical or the cross-vaulting of the  Romans, or the other forms of intersecting vaults, he seems to have  taken a hemisphere as a plan to work upon, and fixed his imaginary  centre about the level of the top of the triforium. In the great  square western severy of the nave this was easier, but the other  severies are oblong. Here he stretched his sections out, so as to  include the clerestory windows and their much-needed light. The usual  way of expressing this is to say that the vault is intersected across  by an elliptic cylinder. The wreaths, garlands, and festoons, and the  various conventional patterns with which the edges and surfaces of the  various parts of the vaulting is adorned cannot be estimated from the  pavement. We may add here that the pendentives were purposely  constructed of \"_sound Brick invested with Stucco of Cockle-shell  lime_,\" and not of Portland stone, for further ornament if  required.[95] So are the circular sections.    The nave is connected with the dome by the space between the great  piers or walls of more than 30 feet in length. These piers are also  broader at their ends than those which support the arcading, the  latter covering a square of about 10 feet. The greater massiveness is  owing to their assistance being required in supporting the dome. They  have large pilasters at the angles, and their coffered wagon  vaulting, adorned with geometrical patterns, is very striking.    =The Nave Aisles.=--We will first point out an unnoticed feature in  the great piers at either end. Their inner faces as seen from the  aisles have recesses or niches for the reception of monuments, and  other recesses are generally found in the wall opposite. At the west  of the aisles there are eight of these altogether, just behind the  coupled columns. They are repeated in all the great piers leading to  the dome, but although of sufficient height to permit of the  introduction of life-sized effigies, still remain unoccupied. The  coupled columns are repeated at the entrances to the chapels. At both  ends the perspective is narrowed; at the west by the chapels, at the  east by the breadth of the great piers. The windows stand in recesses  which are segments of circles. Their sides are made to represent piers  with concave surfaces. These latter carry an entablature from which  spring the round window arches. Festoons run below the actual windows,  the concave side piers have panels, and the round arches above  diamond-shaped patterns. There are only three windows on either  side--the chapels taking the place of a fourth--and the depth of their  recesses points out the thickness of the walls. Between each recess  are Composite pilasters in couples, with others opposite against the  piers. These correspond with the lesser pilasters of the arcading, and  from them spring transverse arches, as in the great central aisle. The  vaulting, owing to the severies being nearly square, is regular; in  other respects similar to that already described. The height is much  less than that of the greater aisle, reaching only to the first stage  of the latter.    =The West Chapels.=--They may best be described as squares of 26 feet,  with apses or tribunes at either end which increase the length to 55  feet. They suffer sadly from want of light, the one window in each  being altogether insufficient; but Wren had to do what he could. He  panelled them with oak, and made them of the same height as the  aisles, with vaulting of his favourite kind, drawn out to meet the  windows.    The North Chapel is called the Morning Chapel, from its original use  for morning prayer on weekdays. The mosaic above the altar is in  imitation of a fresco by Raphael. That at the west end, by Salviati,  is in memory of William Hale Hale, a voluminous writer and editor of  the \"Domesday of St. Paul's,\" who was a Residentiary, Archdeacon of  London and Master of the Charterhouse. He died in 1870. The  stained-glass window is in memory of the metaphysician, Henry  Longueville Mansell, Dean of the Cathedral, who died suddenly, after a  rule of three years, in 1871. It is by Hardman, and represents the  Risen Christ and St. Thomas.       [Illustration: THE GEOMETRICAL STAIRCASE.]    The South Chapel is called the Consistory Chapel, because the  Consistory Court has been held here excepting during the time that it  sheltered the Wellington monument. The reliefs in white marble at the  ends--the east by Calder Marshall, and the west by Woodington--have to  do with this monument. Certainly the most appropriate of the six  subjects is that on the west wall which illustrates the Baptist  admonishing the soldiers. \"Do violence to no man ... and be content  with your wages.\" Wellington earned his name of the Iron Duke for the  firmness and sternness with which he punished pillaging and  outrage.[96] The stained-glass window by Mr. Kempe has been lately put  in to the memory of James Augustus Hessey, Archdeacon of Middlesex  (1875-93), whose Bampton Lectures, \"Sunday,\" still remain for  theologians the standard treatise upon the Day of Rest. The Font of  veined Carrara marble, another work of Bird, rather resembles the  round basins resting on stands of the ancient Greek baths than any of  our usual models. As St. Paul's is one of those cathedrals with no  parish annexed, only those connected with it have any claim for  baptisms.    =The Geometrical Staircase.=--This is in the South Tower, and leads  from the Crypt to the Library. It is circular, of a diameter of  twenty-five feet, and so constructed that eighteen steps, each nearly  six feet broad at the outside, lead from the outside entrance to the  interior.

Oberon        600,000       372,000       13     11      7    The most curious fact is that these satellites do not rotate like those  of the other planets. While the moons of the Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and  Saturn accomplish their revolution from east to west, the satellites of  Uranus rotate in a plane almost perpendicular to the ecliptic, and it is  doubtless the same for the rotation of the planet.    If we had to quit the Earth, and fixate ourselves upon another world,  we should prefer Mars to Uranus, where everything must be so different  from terrestrial arrangements? But who knows? Perhaps, after all, this  planet might afford us some agreeable surprises. _Il ne faut jurer de  rien._      NEPTUNE    And here we reach the frontier of the Solar System, as actually known to  us. In landing on the world of Neptune, which circles through the  Heavens in eternal twilight at a distance of more than four milliard  kilometers (2,480,000,000 miles) from the common center of attraction of  the planetary orbs, we once again admire the prodigies of science.    Uranus was discovered with the telescope, Neptune by calculation. In  addition to the solar influence, the worlds exert a mutual attraction  upon each other that slightly deranges the harmony ordered by the Sun.  The stronger act upon the weaker, and the colossal Jupiter alone causes  many of the perturbations in our great solar family. Now during regular  observations of the position of Uranus in space, some inexplicable  irregularities were soon perceived. The astronomers having full faith in  the universality of the law of attraction, could not do otherwise than  attribute these irregularities to the influence of some unknown planet  situated even farther off. But at what distance?    A very simple proportion, known as Bode's law, has been observed, which  indicates approximately the relative distances of the planets from the  Sun. It is as follows: Starting from 0, write the number 3, and double  successively,              0  3  6  12  24  48  96  192  384.    Then, add the number 4 to each of the preceding figures, which gives the  following series:              4  7  10  16  28  52  100  196  388.    Now it is a very curious fact that if the distance between the Earth and  the Sun be represented by 10, the figure 4 represents the orbit of  Mercury, 7 that of Venus, 16 of Mars; the figure 28 stands for the  medium distance of the minor planets; the distances of Jupiter, Saturn,  and Uranus agree with 52, 100, and 196.    The immortal French mathematician Le Verrier, who pursued the solution  of the Uranian problem, supposed naturally that the disturbing planet  must be at the distance of 388, and made his calculations accordingly.  Its direction in the Heavens was indicated by the form of the  disturbances; the orbit of Uranus bulging, as it were, on the side of  the disturbing factor.    On August 31, 1846, Le Verrier announced the position of the  ultra-Uranian planet, and on September 23d following, a German  astronomer, Galle, at the Observatory of Berlin, who had just received  this intelligence, pointed his telescope toward the quarter of the  Heavens designated, and, in fact, attested the presence of the new orb.  Without quitting his study table, Le Verrier, by the sole use of  mathematics, had detected, and, as it were, touched at pen's point the  mysterious stranger.    Only, it is proved by observation and calculation that it is less remote  than was expected from the preceding law, for it gravitates at a  distance of 300, given that from the Earth to the Sun as 10.    This planet was called Neptune, god of the seas, son of Saturn, brother  of Jupiter. The name is well chosen, since the King of the Ocean lives  in darkness in the depths of the sea, and Le Verrier's orb is also  plunged in the semi-obscurity of the depths of the celestial element.  But it was primarily selected to do justice to an English astronomer,  Adams, who had simultaneously made the same calculations as Le Verrier,  and obtained the same results--without publishing them. His work  remained in the records of the Greenwich Observatory.    The English command the seas, and wherever they dip their finger into  the water and find it salt, they feel themselves \"at home,\" and know  that \"Neptune's trident is the scepter of the world,\" hence this  complimentary nomenclature.    Neptune is separated by a distance of four milliards, four hundred  million kilometers from the solar center.    At such a distance, thirty times greater than that which exists between  the Sun and our world, Neptune receives nine hundred times less light  and heat than ourselves; _i.e._, Spitzbergen and the polar regions of  our globe are furnaces compared with what must be the Neptunian  temperature. Absolutely invisible to the unaided eye, this world  presents in the telescope the aspect of a star of the eighth magnitude.  With powerful magnifications it is possible to measure its disk, which  appears to be slightly tinged with blue. Its diameter is four times  larger than our own, and measures about 48,000 kilometers (29,900  miles), its surface is sixteen times vaster than that of the Earth, and  to attain its volume we should have to put together fifty-five globes  similar to our own. Weight at its surface must be about the same as  here, but its medium density is only 1/3 that of the Earth.    It gravitates slowly, dragging itself along an orbit thirty times vaster  than that of our globe, and its revolution takes 164 years, 281 days,  _i.e._, 164 years, 9 months. A single year of Neptune thus covers  several generations of terrestrial life. Existence must, indeed, be  strange in that tortoise-footed world!    While in their rotation period, Mercury accomplishes 47 kilometers  (29-3/8 miles) per second, and the Earth 29-1/2 (18-1/8 miles), Neptune  rolls along his immense orbit at a rate of only 5-1/2 kilometers (about  3-1/4 miles) per second.    The vast distance that separates us prevents our distinguishing any  details of his surface, but spectral analysis reveals the presence of an  absorbent atmosphere in which are gases unknown to the air of our  planet, and of which the chemical composition resembles that of the  atmosphere of Uranus.    One satellite has been discovered for Neptune. It has a considerable  inclination, and rotates from east to west.           *       *       *       *       *    And here we have reached the goal of our interplanetary journey. After  visiting the vast provinces of the solar republic, we feel yet greater  admiration and gratitude toward the luminary that governs, warms, and  illuminates the worlds of his system.    In conclusion, let us again insist that the Earth,--a splendid orb as  viewed from Mercury, Venus, and Mars,--begins to disappear from Jupiter,  where she becomes no more than a tiny spark oscillating from side to  side of the Sun, and occasionally passing in front of him as a small  black dot. From Saturn the visibility of our planet is even more  reduced. As to Uranus and Neptune, we are invisible there, at least to  eyes constructed like our own. We do not possess in the Universe the  importance with which we would endow ourselves.    Neptune up to the present guards the portals of our celestial system; we  will leave him to watch over the distant frontier; but before returning  to the Earth, we must glance at certain eccentric orbs, at the mad,  capricious comets, which imprint their airy flight upon the realms of  space.          CHAPTER VII    THE COMETS    SHOOTING STARS, BOLIDES, URANOLITHS OR METEORIC STONES      What marvels have been reviewed by our dazzled eyes since the outset of  these discussions! We first surveyed the magnificent host of stars that  people the vast firmament of Heaven; next we admired and wondered at  suns very differently constituted from our own; then returning from the  depths of space, crossing at a bound the abyss that separates us from  these mysterious luminaries, the distant torches of our somber night,  terrible suns of infinity, we landed on our own beloved orb, the superb  and brilliant day-star. Thence we visited his celestial family, his  system, in which our Earth is a floating island. But the journey would  be incomplete if we omitted certain more or less vagabond orbs, that  occasionally approach the Sun and Earth, some of which may even collide  with us upon their celestial path. These are in the first place the  comets, then the shooting stars, the fire-balls, and meteorites.    Glittering, swift-footed heralds of Immensity, these comets with golden  wings glide lightly through Space, shedding a momentary illumination by  their presence. Whence come they? Whither are they bound?    What problems they propound to us, when, as in some beautiful display of  pyrotechnics, the arch of Heaven is illuminated with their fantastic  light!    But first of all--what is a Comet?    If instead of living in these days of the telescope, of spectrum  analysis, and of astral photography, we were anterior to Galileo, and to  the liberation of the human spirit by Astronomy, we should reply that  the comet is an object of terror, a dangerous menace that appears to  mortals in the purity of the immaculate Heavens, to announce the most  fatal misfortunes to the inhabitants of our planet. Is a comet visible  in the Heavens? The reigning prince may make his testament and prepare  to die. Another apparition in the firmament bodes war, famine, the  advent of grievous pestilence. The astrologers had an open field, and  their "]]]
