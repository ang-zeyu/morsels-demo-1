The  economy has improved significantly since the fall of the Taliban  regime in 2001 largely because of the infusion of international  assistance, the recovery of the agricultural sector, and service  sector growth. Real GDP growth exceeded 7% in 2007. Despite the  progress of the past few years, Afghanistan is extremely poor,  landlocked, and highly dependent on foreign aid, agriculture, and  trade with neighboring countries. Much of the population continues  to suffer from shortages of housing, clean water, electricity,  medical care, and jobs. Criminality, insecurity, and the Afghan  Government's inability to extend rule of law to all parts of the  country pose challenges to future economic growth. It will probably  take the remainder of the decade and continuing donor aid and  attention to significantly raise Afghanistan's living standards from  its current level, among the lowest in the world. International  pledges made by more than 60 countries and international financial  institutions at the Berlin Donors Conference for Afghan  reconstruction in March 2004 reached $8.9 billion for 2004-09. While  the international community remains committed to Afghanistan's  development, pledging over $24 billion at three donors' conferences  since 2002, Kabul will need to overcome a number of challenges.  Expanding poppy cultivation and a growing opium trade generate  roughly $4 billion in illicit economic activity and looms as one of  Kabul's most serious policy concerns. Other long-term challenges  include: budget sustainability, job creation, corruption, government  capacity, and rebuilding war torn infrastructure.

A chapter on Medals and Coins  contains attractive matter, particularly that portion which relates to  the \"Rosa Americana coins,\" connected as they are with the \"Wood's  half-pence,\" immortalized by Dean Swift. The notes and biographical  sketches by the editor, scattered through the volume, add materially to  its value--as also the numerous maps and engravings. We have heard hints  that some small suggestions of disinterested economists of the public  money, or other considerations less creditable, have been brought to  bear against the continuation of this publication--but we trust that  they will end when they begin. New-York owes it to her own great history  to make its material accessible to all.           *       *       *       *       *    Colonel Albert J. Pickett, of Montgomery, has in the press of Walker and  James, of Charleston, _The History of Alabama, and incidentally of  Georgia and Mississippi, from the Earliest Period_. It will make two  handsome volumes, and from some passages of it which we have read, we  believe it will be a work of very unusual attraction. It will embrace an  account of the invasion of Florida, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi,  by De Soto, in 1539-41; of the Aborigines of these states, their  appearance, manners and customs, games, amusements, wars, and religious  ceremonies, their ancient mounds and fortifications, and of the modern  Indians, the Creeks, Chickasaws Choctaws, Alabamas, Uchees, Cherokees,  and other tribes; the discovery and settlement of Alabama and  Mississippi by the French, and their occupation until 1763; the  occupation of Alabama and Mississippi by the British for eighteen years;  the colonization of Georgia by the English; the occupation of Alabama  and Mississippi by the Spaniards for thirty years; and the occupation of  these states by the Americans from 1800 until 1820. One whole chapter is  taken up with an interesting account of the arrest of Aaron Burr in  Alabama in 1807; and the exciting controversies between Georgia, the  Federal Government, Spain, and the Creek Indians, are treated at length.  The work will be illustrated by really valuable engravings, after  original drawings made by a French traveller in 1564.           *       *       *       *       *    Mrs. Farnham, author of _Prairie-Land_, (a very clever book published  three or four years ago by the Harpers), and widow of the late Mr.  Farnham who wrote a book of travels in Oregon and other parts of the  Pacific country, is now living in a sort of paradise, about seventy  miles south of San Francisco. In a published letter she gives the  following description of her farm:         \"It is very heavily timbered and watered with clear living       streams running through valleys of the most fertile soil, on       which delicious vegetables grow ten months of the year. The       region is especially famed for potatoes, which become almost a       fruit here. The farm I live on is charmingly situated about a       mile from the old Mission, and two from the beach, on which a       tremendous surf breaks and thunders day and night. From my       house I look over the coast-table and range of mountains, the       hills of Monterey, the bay, and a near landscape, exquisitely       diversified by plain and wood, hill and valley, and almost       every shade that herbage and foliage, in a country without       frost, can show. The rainy season is about a month old, and the       earth as green as it is at home in June. Another month will       pile it with clover, and less than another variegate it with an       inconceivable variety of the most exquisite flowers--for this       is the land of flowers as well as of gold. Our prairies are       quite insignificant in their floral shows, compared to it. The       country and climate are faultless--except in the lack of       showers through the dry months. Nearly every thing one can       desire may be grown upon one's own farm here.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Mr. Charles Gayarre, a gentleman distinguished in the affairs of  Louisiana, in which state he has held some important offices, has just  published in a handsome octavo, _Louisiana, its Colonial History and  Romance_, (Harper & Brothers.) It appears from the preface, that Mr.  Gayarre has had excellent opportunities for the collection of materiel  for a really good book of the sort indicated by his title; but this  performance is utterly worthless, or worse than worthless, being neither  history nor fiction, but such a commingling of the two that no one can  tell which is one or which the other. The uncertainty with which it is  read will be disagreeable in proportion to the interest that it excites;  and, knowing something of the colonial history of Louisiana, we are  inclined to think that a book quite as entertaining as this might have  been composed of authenticated facts. Indeed the _Historical Collections  of Louisiana_, by Mr. French, (published by Daniels and Smith,  Philadelphia,) must be to even the most superficial reader a far more  attractive volume.           *       *       *       *       *    The _Pictorial Field Book of the Revolution_, by BENSON J. LOSSING,  (Harper & Brothers,) is a work that cannot well be praised overmuch.  There have been an immense number of illustrated and pictorial histories  of this country, all or nearly all of which are worthless patchwork; but  Mr. Lossing's is a production of equal attractive interest and value.  The first volume only has been completed; one more will follow with all  convenient haste, ending the work. The letter-press is written from  original materials, the drawings of scenery are made from original  surveys, the engravings are executed, all by Mr. Lossing himself; and in  every department he evinces judgment and integrity. The Field Book will  not serve the purposes of a general history, but to the best informed  and most sagacious it will be a useful companion in historical reading,  while to those who seek only amusement in books, it may be commended,  for its pleasant style and careful art, as one of the most entertaining  works of the time.           *       *       *       *       *    We are glad to perceive that Mr. J. H. INGRAHAM, author of _The  Southwest, by a Yankee; Burton, or the Sieges_; and a large number of  the vilest yellow-covered novels ever printed in this country, has been  admitted to the deaconate in the Episcopal church at Natchez, and  intends shortly to remove to Aberdeen, in the same state, to found a  society in that city.           *       *       *       *       *    Mrs. Judson (\"Fanny Forrester\") left Calcutta in January for the United  States, by way of England, and she is now daily expected home, by her  old and warmly attached friends here. We see suggested a volume of her  poems--some of which have much tenderness and beauty; and hope that  measures will be taken to insure such a publication, for her exclusive  benefit, immediately.           *       *       *       *       *    Our contemporary, the Philadelphia _Lady's Book_, is a little out of  season in its fashions. The April number of that excellent periodical  contains the Parisian Fashions which appeared in _The International_ for  February; and for this present month of May, we see in _The Lady's Book_  the altogether too warm and heavily made dresses given in _The  International_ for last January--mid-winter. Certainly Philadelphia  ought not to be so far behind New-York in these matters. In its literary  character the _Lady's Book_ is still sustained by the contributions of  its favorite critic Mr. Henry T. Tuckerman, with those of Mr. T. S.  Arthur, Miss Adaliza Cutter, and Mrs. Sarah J. Hale.           *       *       *       *       *    We regret that the terms in which we lately announced Mr. J. R. TYSON'S  forthcoming _History of the American Colonies_ were capable of any  misapprehension. We know Mr. Tyson quite too well to entertain a doubt  of his perfect integrity as a historian; but it has been a subject of  frequent observation in the middle and southern states that the  New-England writers, who have furnished most of our histories, have  exaggerated the influence of the Puritans and depreciated that of the  Quakers and Cavaliers: Mr. Tyson himself, we believe, has been of this  opinion; and we merely look for an able, fair, and liberal history, from  his point of view.           *       *       *       *       *    Mr. VALENTINE is preparing a new volume of his _Manual of the Common  Council of New-York_. The volumes hitherto published have been edited  with great care and judgment; they embody an extraordinary amount and  variety of interesting and important facts connected with the  advancement and condition of the city; and the series is indispensable  to any one who would write a history of New-York, or the lives of its  leading citizens. The last volume was unusually rich in maps and  statistics, and we understand that the next one will be even more  interesting and valuable.           *       *       *       *       *    Mr. WILLIS has just published (through Charles Scribner) a new volume  under the characteristic title of _Hurry-graphs, or Sketches of Scenery,  Celebrities and Society_, taken from life. It embraces the author's  letters to the Home Journal, from Plymouth, Montrose, the Delaware, the  Hudson, the Highlands, and other summer resorts, with personal  descriptions of Webster, Everett, Emerson, Cooper, Jenny Lind, and many  other notabilities. It will be a delightful companion for the watering  places this season.           *       *       *       *       *    Among the most beautiful books from the American press is _Episodes of  Insect Life_, by ACHETA DOMESTICA, just reprinted by J.
