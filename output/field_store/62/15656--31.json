Zoolog. Soc.' 1862 page  13. The skull has since been described much more fully by Professor Lucae  in a very interesting essay, 'Der Schadel des Maskenschweines' 1870. He  confirms the conclusion of von Nathusius on the relationship of this kind  of pig.) has described the skull of this animal, which he ranks not only as  a distinct species, but places it in a distinct section of the genus.  Nathusius, however, after his careful study of the whole group, states  positively ('Schweineschadel' s. 153-158). that the skull in all essential  characters closely resembles that of the short-eared Chinese breed of the  S. indicus type. Hence Nathusius considers the Japan pig as only a  domesticated variety of S. indicus: if this really be the case, it is a  wonderful instance of the amount of modification which can be effected  under domestication.    Formerly there existed in the central islands of the Pacific Ocean a  singular breed of pigs. These are described by the Rev. D. Tyerman and G.  Bennett (3/13. 'Journal of Voyages and Travels from 1821 to 1829' volume 1  page 300.) as of small size, hump-backed, with a disproportionately long  head, with short ears turned backwards, with a bushy tail not more than two  inches in length, placed as if it grew from the back. Within half a century  after the introduction of European and Chinese pigs into these islands, the  native breed, according to the above authors, became almost completely lost  by being repeatedly crossed with them. Secluded islands, as might have been  expected, seem favourable for the production or retention of peculiar  breeds; thus, in the Orkney Islands, the hogs have been described as very  small, with erect and sharp ears, and \"with an appearance altogether  different from the hogs brought from the south.\" (3/14. Rev. G. Low 'Fauna  Orcadensis' page 10. See also Dr. Hibbert's account of the pig of the  Shetland Islands.)    Seeing how different the Chinese pigs, belonging to the Sus indicus type,  are in their osteological characters and in external appearance from the  pigs of the S. scrofa type, so that they must be considered specifically  distinct, it is a fact well deserving attention, that Chinese and common  pigs have been repeatedly crossed in various manners, with unimpaired  fertility. One great breeder who had used pure Chinese pigs assured me that  the fertility of the half-breeds inter se and of their recrossed progeny  was actually increased; and this is the general belief of agriculturists.  Again, the Japan pig or S. pliciceps of Gray is so distinct in appearance  from all common pigs, that it stretches one's belief to the utmost to admit  that it is simply a domestic variety; yet this breed has been found  perfectly fertile with the Berkshire breed; and Mr. Eyton informs me that  he paired a half-bred brother and sister and found them quite fertile  together.    (FIGURE 3. HEAD OF WILD BOAR, AND OF \"GOLDEN DAYS,\" a pig of the Yorkshire  Large Breed; the latter from a photograph. (Copied from Sidney's edition of  'The Pig' by Youatt.))    The modification of the skull in the most highly cultivated races is  wonderful. To appreciate the amount of change, Nathusius' work, with its  excellent figures, should be studied. The whole of the exterior in all its  parts has been altered: the hinder surface, instead of sloping backwards,  is directed forwards, entailing many changes in other parts; the front of  the head is deeply concave; the orbits have a different shape; the auditory  meatus has a different direction and shape; the incisors of the upper and  lower jaws do not touch each other, and they stand in both jaws beyond the  plane of the molars; the canines of the upper jaw stand in front of those  of the lower jaw, and this is a remarkable anomaly: the articular surfaces  of the occipital condyles are so greatly changed in shape, that, as  Nathusius remarks (s. 133), no naturalist, seeing this important part of  the skull by itself, would suppose that it belonged to the genus Sus. These  and various other modifications, as Nathusius observes, can hardly be  considered as monstrosities, for they are not injurious, and are strictly  inherited. The whole head is much shortened; thus, whilst in common breeds  its length to that of the body is as 1 to 6, in the \"cultur-racen\" the  proportion is as 1 to 9, and even recently as 1 to 11. (3/15. 'Die Racen  des Schweines' s. 70.) Figure 3 (3/16. These woodcuts are copied from  engravings given in Mr. S. Sidney's excellent edition of 'The Pig' by  Youatt 1860. See pages 1, 16, 19.) of the head of a wild boar and of a sow  from a photograph of the Yorkshire Large Breed, may aid in showing how  greatly the head in a highly cultivated race has been modified and  shortened.    Nathusius has well discussed the causes of the remarkable changes in the  skull and shape of the body which the highly cultivated races have  undergone. These modifications occur chiefly in the pure and crossed races  of the S. indicus type; but their commencement may be clearly detected in  the slightly improved breeds of the S. scrofa type. (3/17.  'Schweineschadel' s. 74, 135.) Nathusius states positively (s. 99, 103), as  the result of common experience and of his experiments, that rich and  abundant food, given during youth, tends by some direct action to make the  head broader and shorter; and that poor food works a contrary result. He  lays much stress on the fact that all wild and semi-domesticated pigs, in  ploughing up the ground with their muzzles, have,  whilst young, to exert the powerful muscles fixed to the hinder part of the  head. In highly cultivated races this habit is no longer followed, and  consequently the back of the skull becomes modified in shape, entailing  other changes in other parts. There can hardly be a doubt that so great a  change in habits would affect the skull; but it seems rather doubtful how  far this will account for the greatly reduced length of the skull and for  its concave front. It is well known (Nathusius himself advancing many  cases, s. 104) that there is a strong tendency in many domestic animals--in  bull- and pug-dogs, in the niata cattle, in sheep, in Polish fowls, short-  faced tumbler pigeons, and in one variety of the carp--for the bones of the  face to become greatly shortened. In the case of the dog, as H. Muller has  shown, this seems caused by an abnormal state of the primordial cartilage.  We may, however, readily admit that abundant and rich food supplied during  many generations would give an inherited tendency to increased size of  body, and that, from disuse, the limbs would become finer and shorter.  (3/18. Nathusius 'Die Racen des Schweines' s. 71.) We shall in a future  chapter see also that the skull and limbs are apparently in some manner  correlated, so that any change in the one tends to affect the other.    Nathusius has remarked, and the observation is an interesting one, that the  peculiar form of the skull and body in the most highly cultivated races is  not characteristic of any one race, but is common to all when improved up  to the same standard. Thus the large-bodied, long-eared, English breeds  with a convex back, and the small-bodied, short-eared, Chinese breeds with  a concave back, when bred to the same state of perfection, nearly resemble  each other in the form of the head and body. This result, it appears, is  partly due to similar causes of change acting on the several races, and  partly to man breeding the pig for one sole purpose, namely, for the  greatest amount of flesh and fat; so that selection has always tended  towards one and the same end. With most domestic animals the result of  selection has been divergence of character, here it has been convergence.  (3/19. 'Die Racen des Schweines' s. 47. 'Schweineschadel' s. 104. Compare  also the figures of the old Irish and the improved Irish breeds in  Richardson on 'The Pig' 1847.)    The nature of the food supplied during many generations has apparently  affected the length of the intestines; for, according to Cuvier (3/20.  Quoted by Isid. Geoffroy 'Hist. Nat. Gen.' tome 3 page 441.), their length  to that of the body in the wild boar is as 9 to 1,--in the common domestic  boar as 13.5 to 1,--and in the Siam breed as 16 to 1. In this latter breed  the greater length may be due either to descent from a distinct species or  to more ancient domestication. The number of mammae vary, as does the  period of gestation. The latest authority says (3/21. S. Sidney 'The Pig'  page 61.) that \"the period averages from 17 to 20 weeks,\" but I think there  must be some error in this statement: in M. Tessier's observations on 25  sows it varied from 109 to 123 days. The Rev. W.D. Fox has given me ten  carefully recorded cases with well-bred pigs, in which the period varied  from 101 to 116 days. According to Nathusius the period is shortest in the  races which come early to maturity; but the course of their development  does not appear to be actually shortened, for the young animal is born,  judging from the state of the skull, less fully developed, or in a more  embryonic condition (3/22. 'Schweineschadel' s. 2, 20.) than in the case of  common swine. In the highly cultivated and early matured races the teeth,  also, are developed earlier.    The difference in the number of the vertebrae and ribs in different kinds  of pigs, as observed by Mr. Eyton (3/23. 'Proc. Zoolog. Soc.' 1837 page 23.  I have not given the caudal vertebrae, as Mr. Eyton says some might  possibly have been lost. I have added together the dorsal and lumbar  vertebrae, owing to Prof. Owen's remarks ('Journal Linn. Soc.' volume 2  page 28) on the difference between dorsal and lumbar vertebrae depending  only on the development of the ribs. Nevertheless the difference in the  number of the ribs in pigs deserves notice. M.

He has had so much trouble, that probably his brain  is turned.\"    \"Let us see,\" said Harriet; and instantly she began to sing, \"'Tis the  Last Rose.\"    While she sang, Lionel entered slowly. He had heard. Harriet ran to  him and would have thrown herself into his arms, but he held her off,  fearing she was again deceiving him.    \"No, no, I repent, and it was I who took thy ring to the Queen! I have  learned that thy father was a nobleman--the great Earl of Derby; and  the Queen sends the message to thee that she would undo the wrong done  thee. Thou art the Earl of Derby--and I love thee--so take my hand if  thou wilt have me.\"    Well, this was all very well, but Lionel was not inclined to be played  fast and loose with in that fashion. When he was a plain farmer, she  had nothing of this sort to say to him, however she may have felt.    \"No,\" he declared, \"I will have none of it! Leave me, all of you,\" and  he rushed off, whereupon Harriet sank upon a bench, quite overcome.  Then suddenly she started up.    \"Ah--I have a thought!\" and out she flew. While she was gone, the  farmer and Nancy, who had really begun to care greatly for each other,  confessed their love.    \"Now that our affairs are no longer in confusion, let us go out and  walk and talk it over,\" Plunkett urged, and, Nancy being quite  willing, they went out. But when they got outside they found to their  amazement that Plunkett's farmhands were rushing hither and thither,  putting up tents and booths and flags, and turning the yard into a  regular fair-ground, such as the scene appeared when Lionel and  Harriet first met. Some of the girls on the farm were assuming the  role of maids looking for service, and, in short, everything was as  nearly like the original scene as they could possibly make it in a  short time.    \"What, what is all this?\" Plunkett asked, amazed. Then he learned it  was all done by Harriet's orders, and he and Nancy began to  understand. Then Harriet came in, dressed as Martha. Nancy ran off and  returned dressed as Julia, and then all was complete.    \"There is Lionel coming toward us,\" Nancy cried. \"What will happen  now?\" and there he came, led sadly by Plunkett. He looked about him,  dazed, till Plunkett brought up Lady Harriet and presented her as a  maid seeking work.    \"Heaven! It is Martha----\"    \"Yes, is this not enough to prove to thee that I am ready to renounce  my rank and station for thee? Here I am, seeking thy service,\" she  pleaded.    \"Well, good lassies, what can ye do?\" Plunkett asked, entering into  the spirit of the thing, and then Nancy gaily sang:         I for spinning finest linen, etc.    Lady Harriet gave Lionel some flowers and then began \"'Tis the Last  Rose.\" Then presently, Lionel, who had been recovering himself slowly  while the play had been going on, joined in the last measures, and  holding out his arms to Lady Harriet, the lovers were united. Nancy  and Plunkett were having the gayest sort of a time, and everybody was  singing at the top of his voice that from that time forth there should  be nothing but gaiety and joy in the world; and probably that turned  out to be true for everybody but old Sir Tristram, who hadn't had a  stroke of good luck since the curtain rose on the first act!

ACT I    Once upon a time, in a far-off forest of Germany, there lived two  little children, Haensel and Gretel, with their father and mother. The  father and mother made brooms for a living, and the children helped  them by doing the finishing of the brooms.    The broom business had been very, very bad for a long time, and the  poor father and mother were nearly discouraged. The father, however,  was a happy-go-lucky man who usually accepted his misfortunes easily.  It was fair-time in a village near the broom-makers' hut, and one  morning the parents started off to see if their luck wouldn't change.  They left the children at home, charging them to be industrious and  orderly in behaviour till they returned, and Haensel in particular was  to spend his time finishing off some brooms.    Now it is the hardest thing in the world for little children to stick  to a long task, so that which might have been expected happened:  Haensel and Gretel ceased after a little to work, and began to think  how hungry they were. Haensel was seated in the doorway, working at the  brooms; brooms were hanging up on the walls of the poor little  cottage; and Gretel sat knitting a stocking near the fire. Being a gay  little girl, she sang to pass the time:    [Music:         Susy little Susy, pray what is the news?       The geese are running bare foot because they've no shoes!       The cobbler has leather and plenty to spare,       Why can't he make the poor goose a new pair?]    This sounded rather gay, and, before he knew it, Haensel had joined in:         Eia popeia, pray what's to be done?       Who'll give me milk and sugar, for bread I have none?       I'll go back to bed and I'll lie there all day,       Where there's naught to eat, then there's nothing to pay.    \"Speaking of something to eat--I'm as hungry as a wolf, Gretel. We  haven't had anything but bread in weeks.\"    \"Well, it does no good to complain, does it? Why don't you do as  father does--laugh and make the best of it?\" Gretel answered, letting  her knitting fall in her lap. \"If you will stop grumbling, Haensel,  I'll tell you a secret--it's a fine one too.\" She got up and tiptoed  over to the table. \"Come here and look in this jug,\" she called, and  Haensel in his turn tiptoed over, as if something very serious indeed  would happen should any one hear him.    \"Look in that jug--a neighbour gave us some milk to-day, and that is  likely to mean rice blanc-mange.\"    \"Oh, gracious goodness! I'll be found near when rice blanc-mange is  going on; be sure of that. How thick is the cream?\" the greedy fellow  asked, dipping his finger into the jug.    \"Aren't you ashamed of yourself! Take your fingers out of that jug,  Haensel, and get back to your work. You'll get a good pounding if  mother comes home and finds you cutting up tricks.\"    \"No, I'm not going to work any more--I'm going to dance.\"    \"Well, I admit dancing is good fun,\" Gretel answered him reluctantly.  \"We can dance a little, and sing to keep us in time, and then we can  go back to work.\"         Brother, come and dance with me,       Both my hands I offer thee,       Right foot first,       Left foot then,       Round about and back again,    she sang, holding out her hands.    \"I don't know how, or I would,\" Haensel declared, watching her as she  spun about.    \"Then I'll teach you. Just keep your eyes on me and I'll teach you  just how to do it,\" she cried, and then she began to dance. Gretel  told him precisely how to do it, and Haensel learned very well and very  quickly. Then they danced together, and in half a minute had forgotten  all about going back to their work. They twirled and laughed and sang  and shouted in the wildest sort of glee, and at last, perfectly  exhausted with so much fun, they tumbled over one another upon the  floor, and were laughing too hard to get up. Just at this moment, when  they had actually forgotten all about hunger and work, home came their  mother. She opened the door and looked in.    \"For mercy's sake! what goings on are these?\" she cried.    \"Why, it was Haensel, he----\"    \"Gretel wanted to----\" they both began, scrambling to their feet.    \"That will do. I want to hear nothing from you. You are the most  ill-behaved children in the world. Here are your father and I slaving  ourselves to death for you, and not a thing do you do but dance and  sing from morning till night----\"    \"It would be awfully nice to eat, too,\" Haensel replied reflectively.    \"What's that you say, you ungrateful child? Don't you eat whenever the  rest of us do?\" However harsh she seemed, the mother was only angry at  the thought of there being nothing in the house to eat, and she felt  so badly to think the children were hungry that she made a dive at  Haensel to slap him, when--horrors! she knocked the milk off the table,  broke the jug, and all the milk went streaming over the floor. This  was indeed a misfortune. There they stood, all three looking at their  lost supper.    \"_Now_ see what you have done?\" she screamed angrily at the children.  \"Get yourselves out of here. If you want any supper you'll have to  work for it. Take that basket and go into the wood and fill it with  strawberries, and don't either of you come home till it is full. Dear  me, it does seem as if I had trouble enough without such actions as  yours,\" the distracted mother cried; and quite unjustly she hustled  the children and their basket outside the hut and off into the wood.    They had no sooner gone out than the poor, distracted woman, exhausted  with the day's tramping and unsuccessful effort to sell her brooms,  sat at the table weeping over the lost milk; and finally she fell  asleep. After a while a merry song was heard in the wood, and the  father presently appeared singing, at the very threshold. Really, for  a hungry man with a hungry family and nothing for supper, he was in a  remarkably merry mood.    \"Ho, there, wife!\" he called, and then entered with a great basket  over his shoulder. He saw the mother asleep and stopped singing. Then  he laughed and "]]]
