In      certain sub-varieties of the Game race we have the unusual case of the      hens differing from each other more than the cocks. In an Indian breed      of a white colour stained with soot, the hens invariably have black      skins, and their bones are covered by a black periosteum, whilst the      cocks are never or most rarely thus characterised. Pigeons offer a more      interesting case; for the two sexes rarely differ throughout the whole      great family, and the males and females of the parent-form, the _C.      livia_, are undistinguishable; yet we have seen that with Pouters the      male has the characteristic quality of pouting more strongly developed      than the female; and in certain sub-varieties[163] the males alone are      spotted or striated with black. When male and female English      carrier-pigeons are exhibited in separate pens, the difference in the      development of the wattle over the beak and round the eyes is      conspicuous. So that here we have instances of the appearance of      secondary sexual characters in the domesticated races of a species in      which such differences are naturally quite absent.    On the other hand, secondary sexual characters which properly belong to the  species are sometimes quite lost, or greatly diminished, under  domestication. We see this in the small size of the tusks in our improved  breeds of the pig, in comparison with those of the wild boar. There are  sub-breeds of fowls in which the males have lost the fine flowing  tail-feathers and hackles; and others in which there is no difference in  colour between the two sexes. In some cases the barred plumage, which in  gallinaceous birds is commonly the attribute of the hen, has been  transferred to the cock, as in the cuckoo sub-breeds. In other cases  masculine characters have been partly transferred to the female, as with  the splendid plumage of the golden-spangled Hamburgh hen, the enlarged comb  of the Spanish hen, the pugnacious disposition of the Game hen, and as in  the well-developed spurs which occasionally appear in the hens of various  breeds. In Polish fowls both sexes are ornamented with a topknot, that of  the male being formed of hackle-like feathers, and this is a new male  character in the genus Gallus. On the whole, as far as I can judge, new  characters are more apt {75} to appear in the males of our domesticated  animals than in the females, and afterwards to be either exclusively or  more strongly inherited by the males. Finally, in accordance with the  principle of inheritance as limited by sex, the appearance of secondary  sexual characters in natural species offers no especial difficulty, and  their subsequent increase and modification, if of any service to the  species, would follow through that form of selection which in my 'Origin of  Species' I have called sexual selection.    _Inheritance at corresponding periods of Life._    This is an important subject. Since the publication of my 'Origin of  Species,' I have seen no reason to doubt the truth of the explanation there  given of perhaps the most remarkable of all the facts in biology, namely,  the difference between the embryo and the adult animal. The explanation is,  that variations do not necessarily or generally occur at a very early  period of embryonic growth, and that such variations are inherited at a  corresponding age. As a consequence of this the embryo, even when the  parent-form undergoes a great amount of modification, is left only slightly  modified; and the embryos of widely-different animals which are descended  from a common progenitor remain in many important respects like each other  and their common progenitor. We can thus understand why embryology should  throw a flood of light on the natural system of classification, for this  ought to be as far as possible genealogical. When the embryo leads an  independent life, that is, becomes a larva, it has to be adapted to the  surrounding conditions in its structure and instincts, independently of  those of its parents; and the principle of inheritance at corresponding  periods of life renders this possible.    This principle is, indeed, in one way so obvious that it escapes attention.  We possess a number of races of animals and plants, which, when compared  with each other and with their parent-forms, present conspicuous  differences, both in the immature and mature states. Look at the seeds of  the several kinds of peas, beans, maize, which can be propagated truly, and  see how they differ in size, colour, and shape, whilst the {76} full-grown  plants differ but little. Cabbages on the other hand differ greatly in  foliage and manner of growth, but hardly at all in their seeds; and  generally it will be found that the differences between cultivated plants  at different periods of growth are not necessarily closely connected  together, for plants may differ much in their seeds and little when  full-grown, and conversely may yield seeds hardly distinguishable, yet  differ much when full-grown. In the several breeds of poultry, descended  from a single species, differences in the eggs and chickens, in the plumage  at the first and subsequent moults, in the comb and wattles during  maturity, are all inherited. With man peculiarities in the milk and second  teeth, of which I have received the details, are inheritable, and with man  longevity is often transmitted. So again with our improved breeds of cattle  and sheep, early maturity, including the early development of the teeth,  and with certain breeds of fowl the early appearance of secondary sexual  characters, all come under the same head of inheritance at corresponding  periods.    Numerous analogous facts could be given. The silk-moth, perhaps, offers the  best instance; for in the breeds which transmit their characters truly, the  eggs differ in size, colour, and shape;--the caterpillars differ, in  moulting three or four times, in colour, even in having a dark-coloured  mark like an eyebrow, and in the loss of certain instincts;--the cocoons  differ in size, shape, and in the colour and quality of the silk; these  several differences being followed by slight or barely distinguishable  differences in the mature moth.    But it may be said that, if in the above cases a new peculiarity is  inherited, it must be at the corresponding stage of development; for an egg  or seed can resemble only an egg or seed, and the horn in a full-grown ox  can resemble only a horn. The following cases show inheritance at  corresponding periods more plainly, because they refer to peculiarities  which might have supervened, as far as we can see, earlier or later in  life, yet are inherited at the same period at which they first appeared.        In the Lambert family the porcupine-like excrescences appeared in the      father and sons at the same age, namely, about nine weeks after {77}      birth.[164] In the extraordinary hairy family described by Mr.      Crawfurd,[165] children were produced during three generations with      hairy ears; in the father the hair began to grow over his body at six      years old; in his daughter somewhat earlier, namely, at one year; and      in both generations the milk teeth appeared late in life, the permanent      teeth being afterwards singularly deficient. Greyness of hair at an      unusually early age has been transmitted in some families. These cases      border on diseases inherited at corresponding periods of life, to which      I shall immediately refer.        It is a well-known peculiarity with almond-tumbler pigeons, that the      full beauty and peculiar character of the plumage does not appear until      the bird has moulted two or three times. Neumeister describes and      figures a breed of pigeons in which the whole body is white except the      breast, neck, and head; but before the first moult all the white      feathers acquire coloured edges. Another breed is more remarkable: its      first plumage is black, with rusty-red wing-bars and a crescent-shaped      mark on the breast; these marks then became white, and remain so during      three or four moults; but after this period the white spreads over the      body, and the bird loses its beauty.[166] Prize canary-birds have their      wings and tail black: \"this colour, however, is only retained until the      first moult, so that they must be exhibited ere the change takes place.      Once moulted, the peculiarity has ceased. Of course all the birds      emanating from this stock have black wings and tails the first      year.\"[167] A curious and somewhat analogous account has been      given[168] of a family of wild pied rooks which were first observed in      1798, near Chalfont, and which every year from that date up to the      period of the published notice, viz. 1837, \"have several of their brood      particoloured, black and white. This variegation of the plumage,      however, disappears with the first moult; but among the next young      families there are always a few pied ones.\" These changes of plumage,      which appear and are inherited at various corresponding periods of life      in the pigeon, canary-bird, and rook, are remarkable, because the      parent-species undergo no such change.        Inherited diseases afford evidence in some respects of less value than      the foregoing cases, because diseases are not necessarily connected      with any change in structure; but in other respects of more value,      because the periods have been more carefully observed. Certain diseases      are communicated to the child apparently by a process like inoculation,      and the child is from the first affected; such cases may be here passed      over. Large classes of diseases usually appear at certain ages, such as      St. Vitus's"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2892"],[0,"Irish Fairy Tales (#20)"],[1,"eleven men and fifty women were dead. But it was through  fright the women died, for not one of them had a wound or a bruise or a  mark.        CHAPTER III    AT the end of a fortnight Fionn and Goll and the chief men of the Fianna  attended at Tara. The king, his son and daughter, with Flahri, Feehal,  and Fintan mac Bocna sat in the place of judgement, and Cormac called on  the witnesses for evidence.    Fionn stood up, but the moment he did so Goll mac Morna arose also.    \"I object to Fionn giving evidence,\" said he.    \"Why so?\" the king asked.    \"Because in any matter that concerned me Fionn would turn a lie into  truth and the truth into a lie.\"    \"I do not think that is so,\" said Fionn.    \"You see, he has already commenced it,\" cried Goll.    \"If you object to the testimony of the chief person present, in what way  are we to obtain evidence?\" the king demanded.    \"I,\" said Goll, \"will trust to the evidence of Fergus True-Lips. He is  Fionn's poet, and will tell no lie against his master; he is a poet, and  will tell no lie against any one.\"    \"I agree to that,\" said Fionn.    \"I require, nevertheless,\" Goll continued, \"that Fergus should swear  before the Court, by his gods, that he will do justice between us.\"    Fergus was accordingly sworn, and gave his evidence. He stated that  Fionn's brother Cairell struck Cona'n mac Morna, that Goll's two sons  came to help Cona'n, that Oscar went to help Cairell, and with that  Fionn's people and the clann-Morna rose at each other, and what had  started as a brawl ended as a battle with eleven hundred of Fionn's  people and sixty-one of Goll's people dead.    \"I marvel,\" said the king in a discontented voice, \"that, considering  the numbers against them, the losses of clann-Morna should be so small.\"    Fionn blushed when he heard that.    Fergus replied:    \"Goll mac Morna covered his people with his shield. All that slaughter  was done by him.\"    \"The press was too great,\" Fionn grumbled. \"I could not get at him in  time or---\"    \"Or what?\" said Goll with a great laugh.    Fionn shook his head sternly and said no more.    \"What is your judgement?\" Cormac demanded of his fellow-judges.    Flahri pronounced first.    \"I give damages to clann-Morna.\"    \"Why?\" said Cormac.    \"Because they were attacked first.\"    Cormac looked at him stubbornly.    \"I do not agree with your judgement,\" he said.    \"What is there faulty in it?\" Flahri asked.    \"You have not considered,\" the king replied, \"that a soldier owes  obedience to his captain, and that, given the time and the place, Fionn  was the captain and Goll was only a simple soldier.\"    Flahri considered the king's suggestion.    \"That,\" he said, \"would hold good for the white-striking or blows of  fists, but not for the red-striking or sword-strokes.\"    \"What is your judgement?\" the king asked Feehal. Feehal then pronounced:    \"I hold that clann-Morna were attacked first, and that they are to be  free from payment of damages.\"    \"And as regards Fionn?\" said Cormac.    \"I hold that on account of his great losses Fionn is to be exempt  from payment of damages, and that his losses are to be considered as  damages.\"    \"I agree in that judgement,\" said Fintan.    The king and his son also agreed, and the decision was imparted to the  Fianna.    \"One must abide by a judgement,\" said Fionn.    \"Do you abide by it?\" Goll demanded.    \"I do,\" said Fionn.    Goll and Fionn then kissed each other, and thus peace was made. For,  notwithstanding the endless bicker of these two heroes, they loved each  other well.      Yet, now that the years have gone by, I think the fault lay with Goll  and not with Fionn, and that the judgement given did not consider  everything. For at that table Goll should not have given greater gifts  than his master and host did. And it was not right of Goll to take by  force the position of greatest gift-giver of the Fianna, for there was  never in the world one greater at giving gifts, or giving battle, or  making poems than Fionn was.    That side of the affair was not brought before the Court. But perhaps it  was suppressed out of delicacy for Fionn, for if Goll could be accused  of ostentation, Fionn was open to the uglier charge of jealousy. It  was, nevertheless, Goll's forward and impish temper which commenced the  brawl, and the verdict of time must be to exonerate Fionn and to let the  blame go where it is merited.    There is, however, this to be added and remembered, that whenever Fionn  was in a tight corner it was Goll that plucked him out of it; and, later  on, when time did his worst on them all and the Fianna were sent to hell  as unbelievers, it was Goll mac Morna who assaulted hell, with a chain  in his great fist and three iron balls swinging from it, and it was  he who attacked the hosts of great devils and brought Fionn and the  Fianna-Finn out with him.          THE CARL OF THE DRAB COAT        CHAPTER I    One day something happened to Fionn, the son of Uail; that is, he  departed from the world of men, and was set wandering in great distress  of mind through Faery. He had days and nights there and adventures  there, and was able to bring back the memory of these.    That, by itself, is wonderful, for there are few people who remember  that they have been to Faery or aught of all that happened to them in  that state.    In truth we do not go to Faery, we become Faery, and in the beating of a  pulse we may live for a year or a thousand years. But when we return  the memory is quickly clouded, and we seem to have had a dream or seen a  vision, although we have verily been in Faery.    It was wonderful, then, that Fionn should have remembered all that  happened to him in that wide-spun moment, but in this tale there is yet  more to marvel at; for not only did Fionn go to Faery, but the great  army which he had marshalled to Ben Edair [The Hill of Howth] were  translated also, and neither he nor they were aware that they had  departed from the world until they came back to it.    Fourteen battles, seven of the reserve and seven of the regular Fianna,  had been taken by the Chief on a great march and manoeuvre. When they  reached Ben Edair it was decided to pitch camp so that the troops  might rest in view of the warlike plan which Fionn had imagined for the  morrow. The camp was chosen, and each squadron and company of the host  were lodged into an appropriate place, so there was no overcrowding and  no halt or interruption of the march; for where a company halted that  was its place of rest, and in that place it hindered no other company,  and was at its own ease.    When this was accomplished the leaders of battalions gathered on a  level, grassy plateau overlooking the sea, where a consultation began  as to the next day's manoeuvres, and during this discussion they looked  often on the wide water that lay wrinkling and twinkling below them.    A roomy ship under great press of sall was bearing on Ben Edair from the  east.    Now and again, in a lull of the discussion, a champion would look and  remark on the hurrying vessel; and it may have been during one of these  moments that the adventure happened to Fionn and the Fianna.    \"I wonder where that ship comes from?\" said Cona'n idly.    But no person could surmise anything about it beyond that it was a  vessel well equipped for war.    As the ship drew by the shore the watchers observed a tall man swing  from the side by means of his spear shafts, and in a little while this  gentleman was announced to Fionn, and was brought into his presence.    A sturdy, bellicose, forthright personage he was indeed. He was equipped  in a wonderful solidity of armour, with a hard, carven helmet on  his head, a splendid red-bossed shield swinging on his shoulder, a  wide-grooved, straight sword clashing along his thigh. On his shoulders  under the shield he carried a splendid scarlet mantle; over his breast  was a great brooch of burnt gold, and in his fist he gripped a pair of  thick-shafted, unburnished spears.    Fionn and the champions looked on this gentleman, and they admired  exceedingly his bearing and equipment.    \"Of what blood are you, young gentleman?\" Fionn demanded, \"and from  which of the four corners of the world do you come?\"    \"My name is Cael of the Iron,\" the stranger answered, \"and I am son to  the King of Thessaly.\"    \"What errand has brought you here?\"    \"I do not go on errands,\" the man replied sternly, \"but on the affairs  that please me.\"    \"Be it so. What is the pleasing affair which brings you to this land?\"    \"Since I left my own country I have not gone from a land or an island  until it paid tribute to me and acknowledged my lordship.\"    \"And you have come to this realm,\" cried Fionn, doubting his ears.    \"For tribute and sovereignty,\" growled that other, and he struck the  haft of his spear violently on the ground.    \"By my hand,\" said Cona'n, \"we have never heard of a warrior, however  great, but his peer was found in Ireland, and the funeral songs of all  such have been chanted by the women of this land.\"    \"By my hand and word,\" said the harsh stranger, \"your talk makes me  think of a small boy or of an idiot.\"    \"Take heed, sir,\" said Fionn, \"for the champions and great dragons of  the Gael are standing by you, and around us there are fourteen battles  of the Fianna of Ireland.\"    \"If all the Fianna who have died in the last seven years were added to  all that are now here,\" the stranger asserted, \"I would treat all of  these and those grievously, and would curtail their limbs and their  lives.\"    \"It is no small boast,\" Cona'n murmured, staring at him.    \"It is no boast at all,\" said Cael, \"and, to show my quality and  standing, I will propose a deed to you.\"    \"Give out your deed,\" Fionn commanded.    \"Thus,\" said Cael with cold savagery. \"If you can find a man among your  fourteen battalions who can outrun or outwrestle or outfight me, I will  take myself off to my"]]]
