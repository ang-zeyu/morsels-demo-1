Such percentage ratings are unscientific and misleading; they  present definite figures for what are mere arbitrary determinations. The  values assigned to the several functions are purely arbitrary in the  first place, and in the second place the decision as to how near those  values any mixer approaches are matters of personal judgment.    _The most efficient mixer is the one that gives the maximum product of  standard quality at the least cost for production._    This rule recognizes the fact that in practical construction different  standards of quality are accepted for different kinds of work. No  engineer demands, for example, the same quality of mixture for a  pavement base that he does for a reinforced concrete girder. If mixer A  turns out concrete of a quality suitable for pavement base cheaper than  does mixer B, then it is the more efficient mixer for the purpose, even  though mixer B will make the superior quality of concrete required for a  reinforced girder while mixer A will not. This method of determining  efficiency holds accurate for any standard of quality that may be  demanded.          CHAPTER V.    METHODS AND COST OF DEPOSITING CONCRETE UNDER WATER AND OF SUBAQUEOUS  GROUTING.      Mixed concrete if emptied loose and allowed to sink through water is  destroyed; the cement paste is washed away and the sand and stone settle  onto the bottom more or less segregated and practically without  cementing value. In fact, if concrete is deposited with the utmost care  in closed buckets and there is any current to speak of a considerable  portion of cement is certain to wash out of the deposited mass. Even in  almost still water some of the cement will rise to the surface and  appear as a sort of milky scum, commonly called _laitance_. Placing  concrete under water, therefore, involves the distinctive task of  providing means to prevent the washing action of the water. It is also  distinguished from work done in air by the fact that it cannot be  compacted by ramming, but the main problem is that of preventing wash  during and after placing.    ~DEPOSITING IN CLOSED BUCKETS.~--Special buckets for depositing concrete  under water are made by several manufacturers of concrete buckets. These  buckets vary in detail but are all similar in having doors to close the  concrete away from the water and, generally, in being bottom dumping.    The bucket shown by Fig. 26 was designed by Mr. John F. O'Rourke, and is  built by the Cockburn Barrow & Machine Co., of Jersey City, N. J. This  bucket was used in depositing the concrete for the City Island Bridge  foundations described in Chapter XII and also in a number of other  works. It consists of a nearly cubical shell of steel open at top and  bottom, and having heavy timbers rivetted around the bottom edges. The  open top has two flat flap doors. Two similar doors hinged about midway  of the sides close to form a V-shaped hopper bottom inside the shell and  serve when open, to close the openings in the sides of the shell. In  loading the bucket the bottom doors are drawn inward and upward by the  chains and held by a temporary key. The loaded bucket is then lifted by  the bail and the key removed, since when suspended the pull on the bail  holds the chains taut and the doors closed. As soon as the bucket rests  on the bottom the pull of the concrete on the doors slides the bail down  and the doors swing downward and back discharging the concrete. The  timbers around the bottom edges keep the bucket from sinking into the  deposited concrete, and the doors and shell exclude all water from the  batch until it is finally in place.    [Illustration: Fig. 26.--O'Rourke Bucket fur Depositing Concrete Under  Water.]    The subaqueous concrete bucket shown by Figs. 27 and 28 is made by the  Cyclopean Iron Works Co., Jersey City, N. J. Fig. 27 shows the bucket  suspended full ready for lowering; the cover is closed and latched and  the bail is held vertical by the tag line catch A. Other points to be  noted are the eccentric pivoting of the bail, the latch unlocking lever  and roller B and C, and the stop D. In the position shown the  bucket is lowered through the water and when at the proper depth just  above bottom the tag line is given a sharp pull, uncatching the bail.  The body of the bucket turns bottom side up, revolving on the bail  pivots, and just as the revolution is completed the bail engages the  roller C on the latch unlocking lever and swings the lever enough to  unlatch the top and allow it to swing down as shown by Fig. 28 and  release the concrete. The stop D keeps the body of the bucket from  swinging beyond the vertical in dumping.    [Illustration: Fig. 27.--Cyclopean Bucket for Depositing Concrete Under  Water (Closed Position).]    [Illustration: Fig. 28.--Cyclopean Bucket for Depositing Concrete Under  Water (Open Position).]    Figures 29 and 30 show the subaqueous concrete bucket made by the G. L.  Stuebner Iron Works, Long Island City, N. Y., essentially the same  bucket, omitting the cover and with a peaked bail, is used for work in  air. For subaqueous work the safety hooks A are lifted from the angles  B and wired to the bail in the position shown by the dotted lines, and  a tag line is attached to the handle bar C. The bucket being filled  and the cover placed is lowered through the water to the bottom and then  discharged by a pull on the tag line.    ~DEPOSITING IN BAGS.~--Two methods of depositing concrete in bags are  available to the engineer; one method is to employ a bag of heavy tight  woven material, from which the concrete is emptied at the bottom, the  bag serving like the buckets previously described simply as means of  conveyance, and the other method is to use bags of paper or loose woven  gunnysack which are left in the work, the idea being that the paper will  soften or the cement will ooze out through the openings in the cloth  sufficiently to bond the separate bagfuls into a practically solid mass.    [Illustration: Fig. 29.--Stuebner Bucket for Depositing Concrete Under  Water (Closed Position).]    [Illustration: Fig. 30.--Stuebner Bucket for Depositing Concrete Under  Water (Open Position).]    [Illustration: Fig. 31.--Bag for Depositing Concrete Under Water.]    [Illustration: Fig. 32.--Form for Molding Footing for Block Concrete  Breakwater.]    The bag shown by Fig. 31 was used to deposit concrete for leveling up a  rough rock bottom and so provide a footing for a concrete block pier  constructed in 1902 at Peterhead, N. B., by Mr. William Shield, M. Inst.  C. E. Careful longitudinal profiles were taken of the rock bottom one at  each edge of the footing. Side forms were then made in 20-ft. sections  as shown by Fig. 32; the lagging boards being cut to fit the determined  profile and the top of the longitudinal piece being flush with the top  of the proposed footing. The concrete was filled in between the side  forms and leveled off by the T-rail straight-edge. In placing the side  forms the longitudinal pieces were placed by divers who were given the  proper elevations by level rods having 10 to 15-ft. extension pieces to  raise the targets above the water surface. When leveled the side pieces  were anchor-bolted as shown to the rock, the anchor-bolts being wedged  into the holes to permit future removal. The concrete was then lowered  in the bag shown by Fig. 31, the divers assisting in guiding the bag to  position. The mouth of the bag being tied by one turn of a line having  loops through which a wooden key is slipped to hold the line tight, a  sharp tug on the tripping rope loosens the key and empties the bag. The  bags used on this work had a capacity of 2Â¼ cu. ft. To permit the  removal of the side forms after the concrete had hardened, a strip of  jute sacking was spread against the lagging boards with a flap  extending 15 to 18 ins. under the concrete. The forms were removed by  divers who loosened the anchor bolt wedges.    In placing small amounts of concrete for bridge foundations in Nova  Scotia, bags, made of rough brown paper were used to hold the concrete.  Each bag held about 1 cu. ft. The bags were made up quickly and dropped  into the water one after the other so that the following one was  deposited before the cement escaped from the former one. The paper was  immediately destroyed by submersion and concrete remained. The bags cost  $1.35 per hundred or 35 cts. per cu. yd. of concrete. Concrete was thus  deposited in 18 ft. of water without a diver.    [Illustration: Fig. 33.--Steel Tremie for Depositing Concrete Under  Water.]    ~DEPOSITING THROUGH A TREMIE.~--A tremie consists of a tube of wood or,  better, of sheet metal, which reaches from above the surface to the  bottom of the water; it is operated by filling the tube with concrete  and keeping it full by successive additions while allowing the concrete  to flow out gradually at the bottom by raising the tube slightly to  provide the necessary opening. A good example of a sheet steel tremie is  shown by Fig. 33. This tremie was used by Mr. Wm. H. Ward in  constructing the Harvard Bridge foundations and numerous other  subaqueous structures of concrete. In these works the tube was suspended  from a derrick. Wheelbarrows filled the tube and hopper with concrete  and kept them full; the derrick raised the tube a few inches and swung  it gently so as to move it slowly over the area to be filled. Care being  taken to keep the tube at one height, the concrete was readily deposited  in even layers. Concrete thus deposited in 18 ft. of water was found to  be level and solid on pumping the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24858"],[0,"The Story of Wool (#20)"],[1,"      perfectly willing to come East and take my degree.
