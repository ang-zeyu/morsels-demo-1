I was put with two or three other  strong, useful-looking horses, and a good many people came to look at  us. The gentlemen always turned from me when they saw my broken knees;  though the man who had me swore it was only a slip in the stall.    The first thing was to pull my mouth open, then to look at my eyes, then  feel all the way down my legs, and give me a hard feel of the skin and  flesh, and then try my paces. It was wonderful what a difference there  was in the way these things were done. Some did it in a rough, offhand  way, as if one was only a piece of wood; while others would take their  hands gently over one's body, with a pat now and then, as much as to  say, \"By your leave.\" Of course I judged a good deal of the buyers by  their manners to myself.    There was one man, I thought, if he would buy me, I should be happy.  He was not a gentleman, nor yet one of the loud, flashy sort that call  themselves so. He was rather a small man, but well made, and quick in  all his motions. I knew in a moment by the way he handled me, that he  was used to horses; he spoke gently, and his gray eye had a kindly,  cheery look in it. It may seem strange to say--but it is true all the  same--that the clean, fresh smell there was about him made me take to  him; no smell of old beer and tobacco, which I hated, but a fresh smell  as if he had come out of a hayloft. He offered twenty-three pounds for  me, but that was refused, and he walked away. I looked after him, but  he was gone, and a very hard-looking, loud-voiced man came. I was  dreadfully afraid he would have me; but he walked off. One or two more  came who did not mean business. Then the hard-faced man came back again  and offered twenty-three pounds. A very close bargain was being driven,  for my salesman began to think he should not get all he asked, and must  come down; but just then the gray-eyed man came back again. I could not  help reaching out my head toward him. He stroked my face kindly.    \"Well, old chap,\" he said, \"I think we should suit each other. I'll give  twenty-four for him.\"    \"Say twenty-five and you shall have him.\"    \"Twenty-four ten,\" said my friend, in a very decided tone, \"and not  another sixpence--yes or no?\"    \"Done,\" said the salesman; \"and you may depend upon it there's a  monstrous deal of quality in that horse, and if you want him for cab  work he's a bargain.\"    The money was paid on the spot, and my new master took my halter, and  led me out of the fair to an inn, where he had a saddle and bridle  ready. He gave me a good feed of oats and stood by while I ate it,  talking to himself and talking to me. Half an hour after we were on our  way to London, through pleasant lanes and country roads, until we came  into the great London thoroughfare, on which we traveled steadily, till  in the twilight we reached the great city. The gas lamps were already  lighted; there were streets to the right, and streets to the left, and  streets crossing each other, for mile upon mile. I thought we should  never come to the end of them. At last, in passing through one, we  came to a long cab stand, when my rider called out in a cheery voice,  \"Good-night, governor!\"    \"Halloo!\" cried a voice. \"Have you got a good one?\"    \"I think so,\" replied my owner.    \"I wish you luck with him.\"    \"Thank you, governor,\" and he rode on. We soon turned up one of the side  streets, and about halfway up that we turned into a very narrow street,  with rather poor-looking houses on one side, and what seemed to be  coach-houses and stables on the other.    My owner pulled up at one of the houses and whistled. The door flew  open, and a young woman, followed by a little girl and boy, ran out.  There was a very lively greeting as my rider dismounted.    \"Now, then, Harry, my boy, open the gates, and mother will bring us the  lantern.\"    The next minute they were all standing round me in a small stable-yard.    \"Is he gentle, father?\"    \"Yes, Dolly, as gentle as your own kitten; come and pat him.\"    At once the little hand was patting about all over my shoulder without  fear. How good it felt!    \"Let me get him a bran mash while you rub him down,\" said the mother.    \"Do, Polly, it's just what he wants; and I know you've got a beautiful  mash ready for me.\"    \"Sausage dumpling and apple turnover!\" shouted the boy, which set them  all laughing. I was led into a comfortable, clean-smelling stall, with  plenty of dry straw, and after a capital supper I lay down, thinking I  was going to be happy.          33 A London Cab Horse      Jeremiah Barker was my new master's name, but as every one called him  Jerry, I shall do the same. Polly, his wife, was just as good a match as  a man could have. She was a plump, trim, tidy little woman, with smooth,  dark hair, dark eyes, and a merry little mouth. The boy was twelve years  old, a tall, frank, good-tempered lad; and little Dorothy (Dolly they  called her) was her mother over again, at eight years old. They were all  wonderfully fond of each other; I never knew such a happy, merry family  before or since. Jerry had a cab of his own, and two horses, which he  drove and attended to himself. His other horse was a tall, white, rather  large-boned animal called \"Captain\". He was old now, but when he was  young he must have been splendid; he had still a proud way of  holding his head and arching his neck; in fact, he was a high-bred,  fine-mannered, noble old horse, every inch of him. He told me that in  his early youth he went to the Crimean War; he belonged to an officer  in the cavalry, and used to lead the regiment. I will tell more of that  hereafter.    The next morning, when I was well-groomed, Polly and Dolly came into the  yard to see me and make friends. Harry had been helping his father since  the early morning, and had stated his opinion that I should turn out a  \"regular brick\". Polly brought me a slice of apple, and Dolly a piece  of bread, and made as much of me as if I had been the \"Black Beauty\" of  olden time. It was a great treat to be petted again and talked to in a  gentle voice, and I let them see as well as I could that I wished to be  friendly. Polly thought I was very handsome, and a great deal too good  for a cab, if it was not for the broken knees.    \"Of course there's no one to tell us whose fault that was,\" said Jerry,  \"and as long as I don't know I shall give him the benefit of the doubt;  for a firmer, neater stepper I never rode. We'll call him 'Jack', after  the old one--shall we, Polly?\"    \"Do,\" she said, \"for I like to keep a good name going.\"    Captain went out in the cab all the morning. Harry came in after school  to feed me and give me water. In the afternoon I was put into the  cab. Jerry took as much pains to see if the collar and bridle fitted  comfortably as if he had been John Manly over again. When the crupper  was let out a hole or two it all fitted well. There was no check-rein,  no curb, nothing but a plain ring snaffle. What a blessing that was!    After driving through the side street we came to the large cab stand  where Jerry had said \"Good-night\". On one side of this wide street were  high houses with wonderful shop fronts, and on the other was an old  church and churchyard, surrounded by iron palisades. Alongside these  iron rails a number of cabs were drawn up, waiting for passengers; bits  of hay were lying about on the ground; some of the men were standing  together talking; some were sitting on their boxes reading the  newspaper; and one or two were feeding their horses with bits of hay,  and giving them a drink of water. We pulled up in the rank at the back  of the last cab. Two or three men came round and began to look at me and  pass their remarks.    \"Very good for a funeral,\" said one.    \"Too smart-looking,\" said another, shaking his head in a very wise way;  \"you'll find out something wrong one of these fine mornings, or my name  isn't Jones.\"    \"Well,\" said Jerry pleasantly, \"I suppose I need not find it out till it  finds me out, eh? And if so, I'll keep up my spirits a little longer.\"    Then there came up a broad-faced man, dressed in a great gray coat  with great gray cape and great white buttons, a gray hat, and a blue  comforter loosely tied round his neck; his hair was gray, too; but  he was a jolly-looking fellow, and the other men made way for him.  He looked me all over, as if he had been going to buy me; and then  straightening himself up with a grunt, he said, \"He's the right sort for  you, Jerry; I don't care what you gave for him, he'll be worth it.\" Thus  my character was established on the stand.    This man's name was Grant, but he was called \"Gray Grant\", or \"Governor  Grant\". He had been the longest on that stand of any of the men, and  he took it upon himself to settle matters and stop disputes. He was  generally a good-humored, sensible man; but if his temper was a little  out, as it was sometimes when he had drunk too much, nobody liked to  come too near his fist, for he could deal a very heavy blow.    The first week of my life as a cab horse was very trying. I had never  been used to London, and the noise, the hurry, the crowds of horses,  carts, and carriages that I had to make my way through made me feel  anxious and harassed; but I soon found that I could perfectly trust my  driver, and then I made myself easy and got used to it.    Jerry was as good a driver as I had ever known, and what was better, he  took as much thought for his horses as he did for himself. He soon found  out that I was willing to work and do my best, and he never laid the  whip on me unless it was gently drawing the end of it over my back when  I was to go on; but generally I knew this quite well by the way in which  he took up the reins, and I believe his whip was more frequently stuck  up by his side than in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2710"],[0,"Louise de la Valliere (#20)"],[1,"he will remain some time in  London,\" said De Wardes, chuckling.    \"You think so,\" said De Guiche, simply.    \"Think so, indeed! do you suppose he was sent to London for no other  purpose than to go there and return again immediately? No, no; he was  sent to London to remain there.\"    \"Ah! De Wardes,\" said De Guiche, grasping De Wardes's hand, \"that is a  very serious suspicion concerning Bragelonne, which completely confirms  what he wrote to me from Boulogne.\"    De Wardes resumed his former coldness of manner: his love of raillery  had led him too far, and by his own imprudence, he had laid himself open  to attack.    \"Well, tell me, what did he write to you about?\" he inquired.    \"He told me that you had artfully insinuated some injurious remarks  against La Valliere, and that you had seemed to laugh at his great  confidence in that young girl.\"    \"Well, it is perfectly true I did so,\" said De Wardes, \"and I was quite  ready, at the time, to hear from the Vicomte de Bragelonne that which  every man expects from another whenever anything may have been said  to displease him. In the same way, for instance, if I were seeking a  quarrel with you, I should tell you that Madame after having shown  the greatest preference for the Duke of Buckingham, is at this moment  supposed to have sent the handsome duke away for your benefit.\"    \"Oh! that would not wound me in the slightest degree, my dear De  Wardes,\" said De Guiche, smiling, notwithstanding the shiver that  ran through his whole frame. \"Why, such a favor would be too great a  happiness.\"    \"I admit that, but if I absolutely wished to quarrel with you, I should  try and invent a falsehood, perhaps, and speak to you about a certain  arbor, where you and that illustrious princess were together--I should  speak also of certain gratifications, of certain kissings of the hand;  and you who are so secret on all occasions, so hasty, so punctilious--\"    \"Well,\" said De Guiche, interrupting him, with a smile upon his lips,  although he almost felt as if he were going to die; \"I swear I should  not care for that, nor should I in any way contradict you; for you must  know, my dear marquis, that for all matters which concern myself I am a  block of ice; but it is a very different thing when an absent friend  is concerned, a friend, who, on leaving, confided his interests to my  safe-keeping; for such a friend, De Wardes, believe me, I am like fire  itself.\"    \"I understand you, Monsieur de Guiche. In spite of what you say, there  cannot be any question between us, just now, either of Bragelonne or of  this insignificant girl, whose name is La Valliere.\"    At this moment some of the younger courtiers were crossing the  apartment, and having already heard the few words which had just been  pronounced, were able also to hear those which were about to follow. De  Wardes observed this, and continued aloud:--\"Oh! if La Valliere were a  coquette like Madame, whose innocent flirtations, I am sure, were, first  of all, the cause of the Duke of Buckingham being sent back to England,  and afterwards were the reason of your being sent into exile; for you  will not deny, I suppose, that Madame's pretty ways really had a certain  influence over you?\"    The courtiers drew nearer to the speakers, Saint-Aignan at their head,  and then Manicamp.    \"But, my dear fellow, whose fault was that?\" said De Guiche, laughing.  \"I am a vain, conceited fellow, I know, and everybody else knows it too.  I took seriously that which was only intended as a jest, and got myself  exiled for my pains. But I saw my error. I overcame my vanity, and I  obtained my recall, by making the _amende honorable_, and by promising  myself to overcome this defect; and the consequence is, that I am so  thoroughly cured, that I now laugh at the very thing which, three or  four days ago, would have almost broken my heart. But Raoul is in love,  and is loved in return; he cannot laugh at the reports which disturb his  happiness--reports which you seem to have undertaken to interpret, when  you know, marquis, as I do, as these gentlemen do, as every one does in  fact, that all such reports are pure calumny.\"    \"Calumny!\" exclaimed De Wardes, furious at seeing himself caught in the  snare by De Guiche's coolness of temper.    \"Certainly--calumny. Look at this letter from him, in which he tells me  you have spoken ill of Mademoiselle de la Valliere; and where he asks  me, if what you reported about this young girl is true or not. Do you  wish me to appeal to these gentlemen, De Wardes, to decide?\" And with  admirable coolness, De Guiche read aloud the paragraph of the letter  which referred to La Valliere. \"And now,\" continued De Guiche, \"there  is no doubt in the world, as far as I am concerned, that you wished  to disturb Bragelonne's peace of mind, and that your remarks were  maliciously intended.\"    De Wardes looked round him, to see if he could find support from any  one; but, at the idea that De Wardes had insulted, either directly or  indirectly, the idol of the day, every one shook his head; and De Wardes  saw that he was in the wrong.    \"Messieurs,\" said De Guiche, intuitively divining the general feeling,  \"my discussion with Monsieur de Wardes refers to a subject so delicate  in its nature, that it is most important no one should hear more than  you have already heard. Close the doors, then, I beg you, and let us  finish our conversation in the manner which becomes two gentlemen, one  of whom has given the other the lie.\"    \"Messieurs, messieurs!\" exclaimed those who were present.    \"Is it your opinion, then, that I was wrong in defending Mademoiselle  de la Valliere?\" said De Guiche. \"In that case, I pass judgment upon  myself, and am ready to withdraw the offensive words I may have used to  Monsieur de Wardes.\"    \"The deuce! certainly not!\" said Saint-Aignan. \"Mademoiselle de la  Valliere is an angel.\"    \"Virtue and purity itself,\" said Manicamp.    \"You see, Monsieur de Wardes,\" said De Guiche, \"I am not the only one  who undertakes the defense of that poor girl. I entreat you, therefore,  messieurs, a second time, to leave us. You see, it is impossible we  could be more calm and composed than we are.\"    It was the very thing the courtiers wished; some went out at one door,  and the rest at the other, and the two young men were left alone.    \"Well played,\" said De Wardes, to the comte.    \"Was it not?\" replied the latter.    \"How can it be wondered at, my dear fellow; I have got quite rusty in  the country, while the command you have acquired over yourself, comte,  confounds me; a man always gains something in women's society; so, pray  accept my congratulations.\"    \"I do accept them.\"    \"And I will make Madame a present of them.\"    \"And now, my dear Monsieur de Wardes, let us speak as loud as you  please.\"    \"Do not defy me.\"    \"I do defy you, for you are known to be an evil-minded man; if you do  that, you will be looked upon as a coward, too; and Monsieur would have  you hanged, this evening, at his window-casement. Speak, my dear De  Wardes, speak.\"    \"I have fought already.\"    \"But not quite enough, yet.\"    \"I see, you would not be sorry to fight with me while my wounds are  still open.\"    \"No; better still.\"    \"The deuce! you are unfortunate in the moment you have chosen; a duel,  after the one I have just fought, would hardly suit me; I have lost too  much blood at Boulogne; at the slightest effort my wounds would open  again, and you would really have too good a bargain.\"    \"True,\" said De Guiche; \"and yet, on your arrival here, your looks and  your arms showed there was nothing the matter with you.\"    \"Yes, my arms are all right, but my legs are weak; and then, I have not  had a foil in my hand since that devil of a duel; and you, I am sure,  have been fencing every day, in order to carry your little conspiracy  against me to a successful issue.\"    \"Upon my honor, monsieur,\" replied De Guiche, \"it is six months since I  last practiced.\"    \"No, comte, after due reflection, I will not fight, at least, with you.  I will await Bragelonne's return, since you say it is Bragelonne who  finds fault with me.\"    \"Oh no, indeed! You shall not wait until Bragelonne's return,\" exclaimed  the comte, losing all command over himself, \"for you have said that  Bragelonne might, possibly, be some time before he returns; and, in the  meanwhile, your wicked insinuations would have had their effect.\"    \"Yet, I shall have my excuse. So take care.\"    \"I will give you a week to finish your recovery.\"    \"That is better. We will wait a week.\"    \"Yes, yes, I understand; a week will give time to my adversary to make  his escape. No, no; I will not give you one day, even.\"    \"You are mad, monsieur,\" said De Wardes, retreating a step.    \"And you are a coward, if you do not fight willingly. Nay, what is  more, I will denounce you to the king, as having refused to fight, after  having insulted La Valliere.\"    \"Ah!\" said De Wardes, \"you are dangerously treacherous, though you pass  for a man of honor.\"    \"There is nothing more dangerous than the treachery, as you term it, of  the man whose conduct is always loyal and upright.\"    \"Restore me the use of my legs, then, or get yourself bled, till you are  as white as I am, so as to equalize our chances.\"    \"No, no; I have something better than that to propose.\"    \"What is it?\"    \"We will fight on horseback, and will exchange three pistol-shots each.  You are a first rate marksman. I have seen you bring down swallows with  single balls, and at full gallop. Do not deny it, for I have seen you  myself.\"    \"I believe you are right,\" said De Wardes; \"and as that is the case, it  is not unlikely I might kill you.\"    \"You would be rendering me a very great service, if you did.\"    \"I will do my best.\"    \"Is it agreed? Give me your hand upon it.\"    \"There it is: but on one condition, however.\"    \"Name it.\"    \"That not a word shall be"]]]
