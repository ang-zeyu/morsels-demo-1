Algeria's    primary political party, the National Liberation Front (FLN), has    dominated politics ever since. Many Algerians in the subsequent    generation were not satisfied, however, and moved to counter the    FLN's centrality in Algerian politics. The surprising first round    success of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) in the December 1991    balloting spurred the Algerian army to intervene and postpone the    second round of elections to prevent what the secular elite feared    would be an extremist-led government from assuming power. The army    began a crack down on the FIS that spurred FIS supporters to begin    attacking government targets. The government later allowed elections    featuring pro-government and moderate religious-based parties, but    did not appease the activists who progressively widened their    attacks. The fighting escalated into an insurgency, which saw    intense fighting between 1992-98 and which resulted in over 100,000    deaths - many attributed to indiscriminate massacres of villagers by    extremists. The government gained the upper hand by the late-1990s    and FIS's armed wing, the Islamic Salvation Army, disbanded in    January 2000. However, small numbers of armed militants persist in    confronting government forces and conducting ambushes and occasional    attacks on villages. The army placed Abdelaziz BOUTEFLIKA in the    presidency in 1999 in a fraudulent election but claimed neutrality    in his 2004 landslide reelection victory. Longstanding problems    continue to face BOUTEFLIKA in his second term, including the ethnic    minority Berbers' ongoing autonomy campaign, large-scale    unemployment, a shortage of housing, unreliable electrical and water    supplies, government inefficiencies and corruption, and the    continuing - although significantly degraded - activities of    extremist militants. Algeria must also diversify its petroleum-based    economy, which has yielded a large cash reserve but which has not    been used to redress Algeria's many social and infrastructure    problems.

But soon, ashamed of their terror, they attempted another attack, and  came attired in the colour of the Prophet. This time no mysterious  stranger speared to forbid their passage and with a cry they climbed the  mountain, listening for any supernatural warning. Nothing disturbed the  silence and solitude save the bleating of flocks and the cries of birds  of prey. Arrived on the platform of Libokovo, they prepared in silence  to surprise the guards, believing the castle full of them. They  approached crawling, like hunters who stalk a deer, already they had  reached the gate of the enclosure, and prepared to burst it open, when  lo! it opened of itself, and they beheld Chainitza standing before them,  a carabine in her hand, pistols in her belt, and, for all guard, two  large dogs.    \"Halt! ye daring ones,\" she cried; \"neither my life nor my treasure will  ever be at your mercy. Let one of you move a step without my permission,  and this place and the ground beneath your feet' will engulf you. Ten  thousand pounds of powder are in these cellars. I will, however, grant  your pardon, unworthy though you are. I will even allow you to take  these sacks filled with gold; they may recompense you for the losses  which my brother's enemies have recently inflicted on you. But depart  this instant without a word, and dare not to trouble me again; I have  other means of destruction at command besides gunpowder. Life is nothing  to me, remember that; but your mountains may yet at my command become  the tomb of your wives and children. Go!\"    She ceased, and her would-be murderers fled terror.    Shortly after the plague broke out in these mountains, Chainitza had  distributed infected garments among gipsies, who scattered contagion  wherever they went.    \"We are indeed of the same blood!\" cried Ali with pride, when he heard  of his sister's conduct; and from that hour he appeared to regain all  the fire and audacity of his youth. When, a few days later, he was  informed that Mouktar and Veli, seduced by the brilliant promises of  Dacha Bey, had surrendered Prevesa and Argyro-Castron, \"It does not  surprise me,\" he observed coldly. \"I have long known them to be unworthy  of being my sons, and henceforth my only children and heirs are those  who defend my cause.\" And on hearing a report that both had been  beheaded by Dacha Bey's order, he contented himself with saying, \"They  betrayed their father, and have only received their deserts; speak no  more of them.\" And to show how little it discouraged him, he redoubled  his fire upon the Turks.    But the latter, who had at length obtained some artillery, answered his  fire with vigour, and began to rally to discrown the old pacha's  fortress. Feeling that the danger was pressing, Ali redoubled both his  prudence and activity. His immense treasures were the real reason of the  war waged against him, and these might induce his own soldiers to rebel,  in order to become masters of them. He resolved to protect them from  either surprise or conquest. The sum necessary for present use was  deposited in the powder magazine, so that, if driven to extremity, it  might be destroyed in a moment; the remainder was enclosed in  strong-boxes, and sunk in different parts of the lake. This labour  lasted a fortnight, when, finally, Ali put to death the gipsies who had  been employed about it, in order that the secret might remain with  himself.    While he thus set his own affairs in order, he applied himself to the  troubling those of his adversary. A great number of Suliots had joined  the Ottoman army in order to assist in the destruction of him who  formerly had ruined their country. Their camp, which for a long time had  enjoyed immunity from the guns of Janina, was one day overwhelmed with  bombs. The Suliots were terrified, until they remarked that the bombs  did not burst. They then, much astonished, proceeded to pick up and  examine these projectiles. Instead of a match, they found rolls of paper  enclosed in a wooden cylinder, on which was engraved these words, \"Open  carefully.\" The paper contained a truly Macchiavellian letter from Ali,  which began by saying that they were quite justified in having taken up  arms against him, and added that he now sent them a part of the pay of  which the traitorous Ismail was defrauding them, and that the bombs  thrown into their cantonment contained six thousand sequins in gold. He  begged them to amuse Ismail by complaints and recriminations, while his  gondola should by night fetch one of them, to whom he would communicate  what more he had to say. If they accepted his proposition, they were to  light three fires as a signal.    The signal was not long in appearing. Ali despatched his barge, which  took on board a monk, the spiritual chief of the Suliots. He was clothed  in sackcloth, and repeated the prayers for the dying, as one going to  execution. Ali, however, received him with the utmost cordiality: He  assured the priest of his repentance, his good intentions, his esteem  for the Greek captains, and then gave him a paper which startled him  considerably. It was a despatch, intercepted by Ali, from Khalid Effendi  to the Seraskier Ismail, ordering the latter to exterminate all  Christians capable of bearing arms. All male children were to be  circumcised, and brought up to form a legion drilled in European  fashion; and the letter went on to explain how the Suliots, the  Armatolis, the Greek races of the mainland and those of the Archipelago  should be disposed of. Seeing the effect produced on the monk by the  perusal of this paper, Ali hastened to make him the most advantageous  offers, declaring that his own wish was to give Greece a political  existence, and only requiring that the Suliot captains should send him a  certain number of their children as hostages. He then had cloaks and  arms brought which he presented to the monk, dismissing him in haste, in  order that darkness might favour his return.    The next day Ali was resting, with his head on Basilissa's lap, when he  was informed that the enemy was advancing upon the intrenchments which  had been raised in the midst of the ruins of Janina. Already the  outposts had been forced, and the fury of the assailants threatened to  triumph over all obstacles. Ali immediately ordered a sortie of all his  troops, announcing that he himself would conduct it. His master of the  horse brought him the famous Arab charger called the Dervish, his chief  huntsman presented him with his guns, weapons still famous in Epirus,  where they figure in the ballads of the Skipetars. The first was an  enormous gun, of Versailles manufacture, formerly presented by the  conqueror of the Pyramids to Djezzar, the Pacha of St. Jean-d'Arc, who  amused himself by enclosing living victims in the walls of his palace,  in order that he might hear their groans in the midst of his  festivities. Next came a carabine given to the Pacha of Janina in the  name of Napoleon in 1806; then the battle musket of Charles XII of  Sweden, and finally-- the much revered sabre of Krim-Guerai. The signal  was given; the draw bridge crossed; the Guegues and other adventurers  uttered a terrific shout; to which the cries of the assailants replied.  Ali placed himself on a height, whence his eagle eye sought to discern  the hostile chiefs; but he called and defied Pacho Bey in vain.  Perceiving Hassan-Stamboul, colonel of the Imperial bombardiers outside  his battery, Ali demanded the gun of Djezzar, and laid him dead on the  spot. He then took the carabine of Napoleon, and shot with it Kekriman,  Bey of Sponga, whom he had formerly appointed Pacha of Lepanto. The  enemy now became aware of his presence, and sent a lively fusillade in  his direction; but the balls seemed to diverge from his person. As soon  as the smoke cleared, he perceived Capelan, Pacha of Croie, who had been  his guest, and wounded him mortally in the chest. Capelan uttered a  sharp cry, and his terrified horse caused disorder in the ranks. Ali  picked off a large number of officers, one after another; every shot was  mortal, and his enemies began to regard him in, the light of a  destroying angel. Disorder spread through the forces of the Seraskier,  who retreated hastily to his intrenchments.    The Suliots meanwhile sent a deputation to Ismail offering their  submission, and seeking to regain their country in a peaceful manner;  but, being received by him with the most humiliating contempt, they  resolved to make common cause with Ali. They hesitated over the demand  for hostages, and at length required Ali's grandson, Hussien Pacha, in  exchange. After many difficulties, Ali at length consented, and the  agreement was concluded. The Suliots received five hundred thousand  piastres and a hundred and fifty charges of ammunition, Hussien Pacha  was given up to them, and they left the Ottoman camp at dead of night.  Morco Botzaris remained with three hundred and twenty men, threw down  the palisades, and then ascending Mount Paktoras with his troops, waited  for dawn in order to announce his defection to the Turkish army. As soon  as the sun appeared he ordered a general salvo of artillery and shouted  his war-cry. A few Turks in charge of an outpost were slain, the rest  fled. A cry of \"To arms\" was raised, and the standard of the Cross  floated before the camp of the infidels.    Signs and omens of a coming general insurrection appeared on all sides;  there was no lack of prodigies, visions, or popular rumours, and the  Mohammedans became possessed with the idea that the last hour of their  rule in Greece had struck. Ali Pacha favoured the general  demoralisation; and his agents, scattered throughout the land, fanned  the flame of revolt. Ismail Pacha was deprived of his title of  Seraskier, and superseded by Kursheed Pacha. As soon as Ali heard this,  he sent a messenger to Kursheed, hoping to influence him in his favour."]]]
