May Jehovah bring a  curse upon me, if anything but death separate you and me.\" When Naomi  saw that Ruth had made up her mind to go with her, she ceased urging her  to return.    So they travelled on until they came to Bethlehem. When they arrived  there, the whole town was interested, and the women said, \"Is this  Naomi?\" But she said to them, \"Do not call me Naomi which means  Sweetness: call me Mara which means Bitterness, for the Almighty has  given me a bitter lot. I had plenty when I left, but Jehovah has brought  me back empty-handed. Why should you call me Naomi, now that Jehovah has  turned against me, and the Almighty has afflicted me?\" So Naomi and Ruth  returned from Moab; and they came to Bethlehem at the beginning of the  barley harvest.    Now Naomi was related through her husband to Boaz, a very wealthy man of  the family of Elimelech. Ruth, the Moabitess, said to Naomi, \"Let me now  go into the fields and pick up the scattered heads of grain after him  whose favor I should win.\" Naomi said to her, \"Go, my daughter.\"    So she went to pick up grain in the field after the reapers; and it was  her good fortune to pick up grain in that part of the field which  belonged to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech. When Boaz come  from Bethlehem and said to the reapers, \"Jehovah be with you,\" they  answered him, \"May Jehovah bless you.\" Then Boaz said to his servant who  had charge of the reapers, \"Whose maiden is this?\" The servant replied,  \"It is the Moabite maiden who came back with Naomi from the land of  Moab; and she said, 'Let me pick up the scattered grain and gather  sheaves after the reapers.' So she came and has worked all the time  until now, and she has not rested a moment in the field.\"    Then Boaz said to Ruth, \"Listen, my daughter. Do not go to pick up grain  in another field nor leave this place, but stay here with my maidens. I  have told the young men not to trouble you. When you are thirsty, go to  the jars and drink of that which the young men have drawn.\"    Then she bowed low and said to him, \"Why are you so kind to me, to take  interest in me who am from another land?\" Boaz replied, \"I have heard  what you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your  husband, and how you left your father and mother and your native land to  come to a people that you did not know before. May Jehovah repay you for  what you have done, and may you be fully rewarded by the God of Israel,  under whose wings you have come to take refuge.\" Then she said, \"I trust  I may please you, my lord, for you have comforted me and spoken kindly  to your servant, although I am not really equal to one of your own  servants.\"    At noonday Boaz said to her, \"Come here and eat some of the food and dip  your piece of bread in the wine.\" So she sat beside the reapers; and he  passed her the roasted grain, and she ate until she had had enough and  had some left. When she rose to gather grain, Boaz gave this order to  his young men: \"Let her gather grain even among the sheaves and do not  disturb her. Also pull out some for her from the bundles and leave it  for her to gather and do not find fault with her.\"    So she gathered grain in the field until evening, then beat out that  which she had gathered; and it was about a bushel of barley. Then she  took it up and went into the city and showed her mother-in-law what she  had gathered. She also brought out and gave her that which she had left  from her meal after she had had enough.    Her mother-in-law said to her, \"Where did you gather grain to-day and  where did you work? A blessing on him who took interest in you!\" Then  she told her mother-in-law where she had worked, and said, \"The name of  the man with whom I worked to-day is Boaz.\" Naomi said to her  daughter-in-law, \"May the blessing of Jehovah rest upon him who has not  ceased to show his love to the living and to the dead.\" Naomi also said  to her, \"The man is a near relative of ours.\" Ruth the Moabitess added,  \"He said to me, 'You must keep near my young men until they have  completed all my harvest.'\" Naomi said to Ruth, \"It is best, my  daughter, that you should go out with his maidens and that no one should  find you in another field.\" So she gathered grain with the maidens of  Boaz until the end of the barley and wheat harvest; but she lived with  her mother-in-law.    [Illustration: (C) _Photographische Gesellschaft, Berlin_    _Ruth_    Painted by Henry Ryland]    Then Naomi said to her, \"My daughter, shall I not try to find a home for  you where you will be happy and contented? Is not Boaz, with whose  maidens you have been, a relative of ours? This very night he is going  to winnow barley on the threshing-floor. So bathe and anoint yourself  and put on your best clothes and go down to the threshing-floor; but do  not make yourself known to the man until he is through eating and  drinking. Then when he lies down, you mark the place where he lies. Go  in, uncover his feet, lie down, and then he will tell you what to  do.\" Ruth said to her, \"I will do as you say.\"    So she went down to the threshing-floor and did just as her  mother-in-law told her. When Boaz was through eating and drinking and  was in a happy mood, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of  grain. Then Ruth came softly and uncovered his feet and lay down. At  midnight the man was startled and turned over, and there was a woman  lying at his feet. He said, \"Who are you?\" She answered, \"I am Ruth your  servant; spread therefore your skirt over your servant, for you are a  near relative.\" He said, \"May you be blest by Jehovah, my daughter; for  you have shown me greater favor now than at first, for you have not  followed young men, whether poor or rich. My daughter, have no fear; I  will do for you all that you ask; for all my townsmen know that you are  a good woman. Now it is true that I am a near relative; yet there is one  nearer than I. Stay here to-night, and then in the morning, if he will  marry you, well, let him do it. But if he, being your nearest relative,  will not marry you, then as surely as Jehovah lives, I will do so. Lie  down until morning.\"    So she lay at his feet until morning, but rose before any one could tell  who she was, for Boaz said, \"Let it not be known that a woman came to  the threshing-floor.\" He also said, \"Bring the cloak which you have on  and hold it.\" So she held it while he poured into it six measures of  barley and laid it on her shoulders. Then he went into the city.    When Ruth came to her mother-in-law, Naomi said, \"Is it you, my  daughter?\" Then Ruth told Naomi all that the man had done for her. She  said, \"He gave me these six measures of barley; for he said, 'Do not go  to your mother-in-law empty-handed.'\" Naomi said, \"Wait quietly, my  daughter, until you know how this will turn out, for the man will not  rest unless he settles it all to-day.\"    Then Boaz went up to the gate and sat down. Just then the near relative  of whom Boaz had spoken came along. To him Boaz said, \"Ho!\" calling him  by name, \"come here and sit down.\" So he stopped and sat down. Boaz also  took ten of the town elders and said, \"Sit down here.\" So they sat down.    Then he said to the near relative, \"Naomi, who has come back from the  country of Moab, is offering for sale the piece of land which belonged  to our relative Elimelech, and I thought that I would lay the matter  before you, and ask you to buy it in the presence of these men who sit  here and of the elders of my people. If you will buy it and so keep it  in the family, do so; but if not, then tell me, that I may know; for no  one but you has the right to buy it, and I am next to you.\" He said, \"I  will buy it.\"    Then Boaz said, \"On the day you buy the field from Naomi, you must also  marry Ruth the Moabitess, the widow of Mahlon, that a son may be born to  bear his name and to receive this field.\" The near relative said, \"I  cannot buy it for myself, for fear I should lose what already belongs to  me. You take my right of buying it as a relative, for I cannot do so.\"    Now in those days this was the custom in Israel: to make an agreement  between two men the one drew off his shoe and gave it to the other. So  when the near relative said to Boaz, \"Buy it for yourself,\" Boaz drew  off the man's shoe.    Then Boaz said to the elders and to all the people, \"You are witnesses  at this time that I have bought all that was Elimelech's and all that  was Chilion's and Mahlon's from Naomi. Moreover, I have secured Ruth,  the Moabitess, the widow of Mahlon, to be my wife so that she may have a  son who will receive this land and carry on Mahlon's name. You are  witnesses this day.\"    Then all the people who were at the gate and the elders said, \"We are  witnesses. May Jehovah make the woman who is coming into your house like  Rachel and Leah, and make you also famous in Bethlehem.\"    So Boaz married Ruth, and she became his wife; and Jehovah gave to her a  son. Then the women said to Naomi, \"Blessed be Jehovah who has not left  you at this time without a near relative, and may his name be famous in  Israel. This child will bring back your strength and take care of you in  your old age; for your daughter-in-law who loves you, who is worth more  to you than seven sons, has a son!\"    So Naomi took the child in her arms and she became its nurse. Her  neighbors also said, \"Naomi has a son!\" and they named him Obed; he  became the father of Jesse, who was the father of David.

The older painting had resembled a careful and  deeply studied diagram, illustrative of the most important facts; it was  not to be understood or relished without application of serious  thought; on the contrary, it developed and addressed the highest powers  of mind belonging to the human race; while the Claude and Salvator  painting was like a scene in a theater, viciously and falsely painted  throughout, and presenting a deceptive appearance of truth to nature;  understood, as far as it went, in a moment, but conveying no accurate  knowledge of anything, and, in all its operations on the mind,  unhealthy, hopeless, and profitless.    89. It was, however, received with avidity; for this main reason, that  the architecture, domestic life, and manners of the period were  gradually getting more and more artificial; as I showed you last  evening, all natural beauty had ceased to be permitted in architectural  decoration, while the habits of society led them more and more to live,  if possible, in cities; and the dress, language, and manners of men in  general were approximating to that horrible and lifeless condition in  which you find them just before the outbreak of the French Revolution.    Now, observe: exactly as hoops, and starch, and false hair, and all that  in mind and heart these things typify and betray, as these, I say,  gained upon men, there was a necessary reaction in favor of the  _natural_. Men had never lived so utterly in defiance of the laws of  nature before; but they could not do this without feeling a strange  charm in that which they defied; and, accordingly, we find this  reactionary sentiment expressing itself in a base school of what was  called _pastoral_ poetry; that is to say, poetry written in praise of  the country, by men who lived in coffee-houses and on the Mall. The  essence of pastoral poetry is the sense of strange delightfulness in  grass, which is occasionally felt by a man who has seldom set his foot  on it; it is essentially the poetry of the cockney, and for the most  part corresponds in its aim and rank, as compared with other literature,  to the porcelain shepherds and shepherdesses on a chimney-piece as  compared with great works of sculpture.    90. Of course all good poetry, descriptive of rural life, is  essentially pastoral, or has the effect of the pastoral on the minds of  men living in cities; but the class of poetry which I mean, and which  you probably understand by the term pastoral, is that in which a  farmer's girl is spoken of as a \"nymph,\" and a farmer's boy as a  \"swain,\" and in which, throughout, a ridiculous and unnatural refinement  is supposed to exist in rural life, merely because the poet himself has  neither had the courage to endure its hardships, nor the wit to conceive  its realities. If you examine the literature of the 17th and 18th  centuries you will find that nearly all its expressions, having  reference to the country, show something of this kind; either a foolish  sentimentality, or a morbid fear, both of course coupled with the most  curious ignorance. You will find all its descriptive expressions at once  vague and monotonous. Brooks are always \"purling;\" birds always  \"warbling;\" mountains always \"lift their horrid peaks above the clouds;\"  vales always \"are lost in the shadow of gloomy woods;\" a few more  distinct ideas about hay-making and curds and cream, acquired in the  neighborhood of Richmond Bridge, serving to give an occasional  appearance of freshness to the catalogue of the sublime and beautiful  which descended from poet to poet; while a few true pieces of pastoral,  like the \"Vicar of Wakefield,\" and Walton's \"Angler,\" relieved the  general waste of dullness. Even in these better productions, nothing is  more remarkable than the general conception of the country merely as a  series of green fields, and the combined ignorance and dread of more  sublime scenery; of which the mysteries and dangers were enhanced by the  difficulties of traveling at the period. Thus in Walton's \"Angler,\" you  have a meeting of two friends, one a Derbyshire man, the other a lowland  traveler, who is as much alarmed, and uses nearly as many expressions of  astonishment, at having to go down a steep hill and ford a brook, as a  traveler uses now at crossing the glacier of the Col du Geant. I am not  sure whether the difficulties which, until late years, have lain in the  way of peaceful and convenient traveling, ought not to have great weight  assigned to them among the other causes of the temper of the period;  but be that as it may, if you will examine the whole range of its  literature--keeping this point in view--I am well persuaded that you  will be struck most forcibly by the strange deadness to the higher  sources of landscape sublimity which is mingled with the morbid  pastoralism. The love of fresh air and green grass forced itself upon  the animal natures of men; but that of the sublimer features of scenery  had no place in minds whose chief powers had been repressed by the  formalisms of the age. And although in the second-rate writers  continually, and in the first-rate ones occasionally, you find an  affectation of interest in mountains, clouds, and forests, yet whenever  they write from their heart, you will find an utter absence of feeling  respecting anything beyond gardens and grass. Examine, for instance, the  novels of Smollett, Fielding, and Sterne, the comedies of Moliere, and  the writings of Johnson and Addison, and I do not think you will find a  single expression of true delight in sublime nature in any one of them.  Perhaps Sterne's \"Sentimental Journey,\" in its total absence of  sentiment on any subject but humanity, and its entire want of notice of  anything at Geneva, which might not as well have been seen at Coxwold,  is the most striking instance I could give you; and if you compare with  this negation of feeling on one side, the interludes of Moliere, in  which shepherds and shepherdesses are introduced in court dress, you  will have a very accurate conception of the general spirit of the age.    91. It was in such a state of society that the landscape of Claude,  Gaspar Poussin, and Salvator Rosa attained its reputation. It is the  complete expression on canvas of the spirit of the time. Claude embodies  the foolish pastoralism, Salvator the ignorant terror, and Gaspar the  dull and affected erudition.    It was, however, altogether impossible that this state of things could  long continue. The age which had buried itself in formalism grew weary  at last of the restraint; and the approach of a new era was marked by  the appearance, and the enthusiastic reception, of writers who took  true delight in those wild scenes of nature which had so long been  despised.    92. I think the first two writers in whom the symptoms of a change are  strongly manifested are Mrs. Radcliffe and Rousseau; in both of whom the  love of natural scenery, though mingled in the one case with what was  merely dramatic, and in the other with much that was pitifully morbid or  vicious, was still itself genuine, and intense, differing altogether in  character from any sentiments previously traceable in literature. And  then rapidly followed a group of writers, who expressed, in various  ways, the more powerful or more pure feeling which had now become one of  the strongest instincts of the age. Of these, the principal is your own  Walter Scott. Many writers, indeed, describe nature more minutely and  more profoundly; but none show in higher intensity the peculiar passion  for what is majestic or lovely in _wild_ nature, to which I am now  referring. The whole of the poem of the \"Lady of the Lake\" is written  with almost a boyish enthusiasm for rocks, and lakes, and cataracts; the  early novels show the same instinct in equal strength wherever he  approaches Highland scenery; and the feeling is mingled, observe, with a  most touching and affectionate appreciation of the Gothic architecture,  in which alone he found the elements of natural beauty seized by art; so  that, to this day, his descriptions of Melrose and Holy Island  Cathedral, in the \"Lay of the Last Minstrel\" and \"Marmion,\" as well as  of the ideal abbeys in the \"Monastery\" and \"Antiquary,\" together with  those of Caerlaverock and Lochleven Castles in \"Guy Mannering\" and \"The  Abbot,\" remain the staple possessions and text-books of all travelers,  not so much for their beauty or accuracy, as for their _exactly  expressing that degree of feeling with which most men in this century  can sympathize_.    Together with Scott appeared the group of poets--Byron, Wordsworth,  Keats, Shelley, and, finally, Tennyson--differing widely in moral  principles and spiritual temper, but all agreeing more or less in this  love for natural scenery.    93. Now, you will ask me--and you will ask me most reasonably--how this  love of nature in modern days can be connected with Christianity, seeing  it is as strong in the infidel Shelley as in the sacred Wordsworth. Yes,  and it is found in far worse men than Shelley. Shelley was an honest  unbeliever, and a man of warm affections; but this new love of nature is  found in the most reckless and unprincipled of the French novelists--in  Eugene Sue, in Dumas, in George Sand--and that intensely. How is this?  Simply because the feeling is reactionary; and, in this phase of it,  common to the diseased mind as well as to the healthy one.
