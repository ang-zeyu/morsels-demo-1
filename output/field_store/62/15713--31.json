His friend took the  decanter from the boy and poured out the brown liquid into the delicate  glasses. He then offered one to Harland and held up his own in token of  courtesy.    \"Well, here's to luck,\" he said, and nodded to Harland. Harland nodded  in return. His nerves twitched him. What was this new sensation of  repugnance? He lifted his glass higher to his mouth. He tried to put it  to his lips. It would not go. He tried again. His arm refused him  service. But the fumes of this familiar liquor mounted to his nostrils,  which dilated with horror. What was this terrible thing which he was  asked to drink? Never had he felt such physical repulsion. A shudder of  disgust shook him. With a curse he dashed the glass to the floor, and  glared suspiciously upon his companion.    \"How dare you ask me to drink this stuff?\" His voice rang with passion.  \"I loathe it! I cannot stand it. Let me go. This is an infernal den, and  I will get out!\"    The men around jumped up and held him. They thought that D. T. had come  at last.    \"Somebody send for the nearest expert,\" said his nearest friend.    This inebriate's first resistance to his dipsomania was interpreted  darkly, with sundry shrugs and winks and gestures.    \"It is too devilish bad,\" said his companion, \"but I knew it would  happen some day.\"    They called a cab and put him in and sent him home. But he gave no  further evidence of insanity. His case became a seven days' gossip and  warning behind the bulging windows of the great Club.    Harland Slack went straightway to Colorado, and came back a man. He went  into law, and succeeded. It is well known that he does not drink. The  committee elected a new heir to damnation in Harland's place at the  Club.           *       *       *       *       *    At the end of an address delivered a year afterward before a close  medical meeting Dr. Alaric Randolph said:    \"A bit of bright, cut glass, and a healthy will, and the proportional  training did this thing. I have not given the man's name, not only on  account of his high social standing and marked mental ability, but also  because he himself is still ignorant of the facts. I have no fear of a  relapse. He has forgotten that he ever believed himself to have murdered  a woman who never existed. But he has not forgotten that he no longer  drinks. This case is now a tested cure. My first successful experiment  in this great, unknown field, rests upon its facts. Alcoholism is  probably as serious an illustration as we could present. The hypnotic  therapeutics have come to stay.\"          SCUD.      It was the morning after my arrival. I had just come, jaded from  examination papers, agued with the incessant ring of orations, abhorrent  of the rustle of white tarlatans, distrustful of the future attitude of  trustees, and utterly wilted from the effect of a country academy  exhibition held in the heat of June in the torridest of Western towns. I  had never seen the ocean, and before my window the glorious old Atlantic  heaved solemnly. Its intermittent swash upon the rocks sent peace into  my soul. I found myself near enough even to throw something into the  water. The longing to communicate with this new friend, dreamed of for  so many inland years, overpowered me. A box of buttons was all I had,  and I leaned far out into the air, pungent with a mixture of fish and  kelp, and cast into the deep these feminine necessities, one by one.  Now a tiny disk of mother-of-pearl would glance on the float and bounce  off into a gray ripple; and then a bit of jet would clatter on the red  granite rocks, and be swallowed by a lapping wavelet that seemed to rise  on purpose for this strange offering. Too soon the box was emptied of  its contents; then there came a mad desire to throw cologne, shoes,  satchel, anything, everything, myself, from the second-story window into  this mysterious, beckoning, repelling Atlantic tide beneath me. Leaning  on the sill, with my whole soul absorbed in this new Nirvana, I was  suddenly and yet not unpleasantly aroused by a strident yell:    \"Hellow, Scud! Wha'che got this mornin'?\"    \"Oh, no-thin', only twenty-six little 'uns, an' a couple bucket o'  bait.\"    The answer came back in a deep, orotund, sing-song voice. It was the  natural intoning of the man of the sea. Two boats shot from under a  rocky headland a few hundred yards before me to the left. One of the  boats made fast to some black corks that formed a huge rectangle in the  water, and two men began pulling in a net. The one in the other boat,  who answered to the name of Scud, stopped rowing for a moment, exchanged  a word or two, and laughed aloud, then cast a critical look at the sun's  altitude, and pulled lazily away. When he was at some distance, he  rested on his oars, and hilloaed with that penetrating sea cry:    \"I hope you'll get two barr'l. I guess thar's 'nough to go all round.\"    That undulatory cadence is entirely lacking in landsmen's tones. Still  this was an extraordinarily joyous voice, as if the life of a fisherman  were a dream without a care or a struggle. But Scud and his queer, green  boat disappeared behind the jagged outline of the rocks, and I turned at  the sound of the first bell to dress for breakfast.    \"Well, how do you like your room? I hope that the fishermen didn't wake  you up too early.\"    My cousin offered me some smoking flakes of fish, new to my limited  experience. This, he said, was inland hake, and was caught that morning  in Scud's trap. Now, although I was hitherto ignorant of this delicious  fish with its paradoxical cognomen, I felt that Scud and I were already  friends; and gravely informed my host that Scud had caught twenty-six  little ones that morning. This piece of information was immediately  greeted with impertinent hilarity.    \"So Scud woke you up?\" said my cousin. \"He's always doing that. There  was one nervous boarder here. She threatened to have him arrested for  breaking the peace. But you might as well arrest a fog-whistle.\"    \"Does he always get up as early in the morning?\" I asked,  apprehensively. \"He must be a very energetic person. Do tell me about  it. What are 'little 'uns'?\"    I must confess to a degree of perplexity when the the whole family burst  into further roars of laughter at my simple question.    \"Scud energetic? Why, he is the easiest, the slowest, the sleepiest, the  most lovable, good-natured fellow on the whole coast. He makes the  surest and perhaps the best living of any of the fishermen around here.  If he didn't get up early he wouldn't do even that. As it is, Salt does  most of the work. Salt is his oldest boy,\" explained my cousin.    \"I am sure Scud needs all he can make,\" interrupted Mabel (she is my  cousin's wife), \"with his dozen children and a wife to support, and only  one trap to do it on.\"    \"For my part,\" interposed the oldest daughter, with a pert motion of her  head, \"I am tired to death having to save clothes for that--You needn't  look so shocked, mamma. Yes, I am. It's always 'Take care of that  petticoat; Betty can use it;' or, 'That dress can be turned and made  over nicely for the twins.' I declare I don't get a new dress but the  whole Scud family troop over and inspect it, and criticise it, and  quarrel over it, and gloat over it the first day I wear it. I caught two  of their boys fighting over which of them should have Reginald's summer  ulster when he was done with it.\"    \"I shall give it to Tommy,\" observed her mother, in an absent,  comfortable tone.    After breakfast my cousin rowed over to the station; the eldest two  children took their guest, a boy of about sixteen, out fishing; while I  eagerly accompanied Mabel across the rocks and fields to Scud's house--a  little rented hut, hidden and sheltered from the east winds behind a  huge barrack of a boarding-house.    How clear the day! How warm the sun! How hospitable this forbidding,  granite-clad North Shore! As I look back upon that memorable morning it  seemed as if the bay could never be ruffled by any but the tenderest  breezes, or its bright water reflect any but the dazzling glare of the  hottest sun. Clouds hovered over us, delicate and fleecy as the feathers  of the marabou, and white and curly as the feathers of the ostrich. They  radiated from a centre in translucent films, and shot out monstrous  ciliated fingers like a fan. Such a sky was never seen in my part of  the country, and I attributed this ravishing cloud phenomenon to the  peculiar influence of the sea, being too ignorant to notice that these  streamers shot out from the west. The stillness was intoxicating after  the scurry of the school-room. And now even the water made no ripples on  the beach. The sea was motionless, like a distilled elixir in a serrated  alembic.    We stopped before a low, pitch-roofed house that looked as if it  contained three rooms at most. The yard was piled up with wreckage and  drift-wood. Who ever heard of a fisherman buying kindling? Within the  gate four children were playing with twice as many cats and kittens.  They were all fighting like animals between themselves for a plateful of  scraps of fried fish. A baby would grab a piece from the plate, and  offer the remainder to a grave tabby, which in turn distributed it to  her offspring. Then the kittens and \"humans\" rolled and scratched, and  shrieked and scratched again.    \"Keep yer mouths shet out there, or I'll be after ye with a stick!\" This  maternal sentiment, spoken in a loud shrill voice, greeted us as we  stepped within the gate.    \"It's I, Betty. I have brought you a little something, and a friend who  wants to see the children.\"    \"Dear sakes! 'tain't you, is it?\" The shrill voice was now modulated in  an entirely different tone. \"Ain't I glad you've come! Step right in and  set down. No? Then I'll be out and see ye ez soon ez I've tended the  baby.\"    \"Baby!\" I gasped, looking at"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33687"],[0,"Illustrative Anecdotes of the Animal Kingdom (#20)"],[1," had gained a  complete victory; but in a few minutes the wolf returned to the charge,  and, approaching as near as he could to the head of the mule, shook  himself, and spouted a quantity of water into the animal's eyes, which  caused him immediately to shut them. That moment, the wolf leaped upon  him, and killed the poor animal before the farmer could come to his  assistance.    In the commencement of the reign of Louis XIV., of France, in the depth  of winter, a party of dragoons were attacked, at the foot of the  mountains of Jurat, by a multitude of wolves; the dragoons fought  bravely, and killed many hundreds of them; but at last, overpowered by  numbers, they and their horses were all devoured. A cross is erected on  the place of combat, with an inscription in commemoration of it, which  is to be seen at this day.      THE FOX.    This animal, which resembles a small dog, is widely distributed over  the colder portions of both continents. There are several species, as  the red, gray, black, silver, arctic, &c. In all ages and countries,  the fox has been remarkable for his cunning, and, from the time of AEsop  to the present day, has figured, in allegory and fable, as the  personification of artifice and duplicity.    _Fruitless Enterprise._--A fox finding himself hard run by the hounds,  at a hunt in Ireland, ran up a stone wall, from which he sprang on the  roof of an adjoining cabin, and mounted up to the chimney-top. From  that elevated station, he looked all around him, as if reconnoitring  the coming enemy. A wily old hound approaching, and having gained the  roof, was preparing to seize the fox, when, lo! renard dropped suddenly  down the chimney. The dog looked wistfully down the dark opening, but  dared not pursue the fugitive.    Meanwhile renard, half enrobed in soot, had fallen into the lap of an  old woman, who, surrounded by a number of children, was gravely smoking  her pipe, not at all expecting the entrance of this abrupt visitor.  \"_Emiladh deouil!_\" said the affrighted female, as she threw from  her the red and black quadruped. Renard grinned, growled, and showed  his fangs; and when the huntsmen, who had secured the door, entered,  they found him in quiet possession of the kitchen, the old woman and  children having retired, in terror of the invader, to an obscure corner  of the room. The fox was taken alive without much difficulty.    _Unavailing Artifice._--Two gentlemen in New Jersey went out to hunt  rabbits. In a low, bushy swamp, the dogs started a fox, and off they  went in swift pursuit. After a chase of two miles, he entered a very  dense thicket, and, making a circuit of the place, returned to the  point whence he first started. The dogs closely pursuing the fox, he  again started for the thicket, when one of the sportsmen shot at him,  and he fell apparently dead at his feet. As he stooped to pick him up,  however, he rose upon his legs and escaped. For two hours and a half,  the thicket was the scene of the wiles of renard; but at last he was  taken, and, being carried home by the men, was thrown, apparently quite  dead, into the corner of the room.    The family sat down to supper. Finding them all busily engaged, he  ventured to reconnoitre, and had cautiously raised himself on his fore  legs for the purpose, but, on finding himself observed, resumed his  quiescent state. One of the party, to ascertain whether the fox was  alive or not, passed a piece of lighted paper under his nose; but the  inanimate stone or log appeared not more senseless at that moment.  Finding all attempts to get away unavailing, renard submitted to his  destiny with a very good grace, and the next morning was as well as  ever, bating a slight wound in the shoulder and a dirty skin.    _Unexpected Resentment._--Some country people in Germany once caught a  pike, but in conveying it home during the night, it escaped. As it was  a large fish, they returned with torches to secure their prize, and  after some time found it on the grass, having fast hold of a fox by the  nose. The animal caught in this novel trap made every effort to escape,  without success; and it was not until the pike was killed, that it was  possible to separate them. It seems that, after the pike was dropped by  the fisherman, renard came across it, and in paying his addresses to  it, was received in the manner we have described.      THE HYENA.    This animal, which is the size of a large dog, belongs to Africa. It is  very ferocious, feeds on flesh, and prefers that which is in a state of  decay. It seems, with the vulture, to be a scavenger to remove masses  of putrid flesh, which, in these hot regions, would otherwise breed  infection and disease.    _Miscellaneous Anecdotes._--Bruce, in his \"Travels in Africa,\" gives us  the following account of the hyena:--    \"One night, being very busily engaged in my tent, I heard something  pass behind me towards the bed, but, upon looking round, could perceive  nothing. Having finished what I was about, I went out, resolving  directly to return, which I did. I now perceived a pair of large blue  eyes glaring at me in the dark. I called to my servant to bring a  light, and there stood a hyena, near the head of my bed, with two or  three large bunches of candles in his mouth. As his mouth was full, I  was not afraid of him; so, with my pike, I struck him as near the heart  as I could judge. It was not till then that he showed any signs of  fierceness; but, feeling his wound, he let the candles drop, and  endeavored to climb up the handle of the spear, to arrive at me; so  that, in self-defence, I was obliged to draw a pistol from my girdle,  and shoot him; nearly at the same time, my servant cleft his skull with  a battle-axe.    \"The hyena appears to be senseless and stupid during the day. I have  locked up with him a goat, a kid, and a lamb, all day, when he was  fasting, and found them in the evening alive and unhurt. Repeating the  experiment one night, he ate up a young ass, a goat, and a fox, all  before morning, so as to leave nothing but some small fragments of the  ass's bones.\"    Sparman furnishes us with the following story:--\"One night, at a feast  near the Cape, a trumpeter, who had got himself well filled with  liquor, was carried out of doors in order to cool and sober him. The  scent of him soon attracted a spotted hyena, which threw him on his  back, and carried him away to Sable Mountain, thinking him a corpse,  and consequently a fair prize.    \"In the mean time, our drunken musician awoke, sufficiently sensible to  know the danger of his situation, and to sound his alarm with his  trumpet, which he carried at his side. The beast, as it may be  imagined, was greatly frightened, in its turn, and immediately ran  away.\"      THE LION.    This animal stands at the head of the numerous family of cats, and has  often been ranked by naturalists as the lord of the brute creation, and  holding the same relation to quadrupeds as the eagle does to birds.    Like all the rest of his genus, the lion steals upon his prey, and,  when at a proper distance, rushes upon it with a bound, securing it in  his sharp claws. In general he is cowardly; but, in pursuit of his  prey, he is, to the last degree, fearless and ferocious. His strength  is so great that he can break a man's skull with the stroke of his paw,  and can drag the body of a cow over the ground at a gallop. His roar is  terrific, and when heard, the animals around seem agitated with the  wildest terror. The lion is common in the hot parts of Africa, and is  occasionally found in India.    _Miscellaneous Anecdotes._--Some Hottentots once perceived a lion  dragging a buffalo from the plain to a neighboring woody hill. They  soon forced him to quit his prey, in order to secure it for themselves.  They now found that the lion had had the sagacity to take out those  inner parts of the buffalo that it rejected as food, in order to make  it easier to carry away the fleshy and eatable parts of the carcass,  thus showing reflection on his part.    It is probable that the lion does not easily venture upon any one who  puts himself in a posture of defence. The following anecdote would seem  to show that this is the case. A young man was walking one day on his  lands in the southern parts of Africa, when he unexpectedly met a large  lion. Being an excellent shot, he thought himself sure of killing him,  and therefore fired. But unfortunately, the charge had been in the  piece for some time, and the ball fell before it reached the animal.  The young man, seized with panic, now took to his heels; but being soon  out of breath, and closely pursued by the lion, he jumped upon a little  heap of stones, and there made a stand, presenting the butt-end of his  gun to his adversary, fully resolved to defend his life as well as he  could.    This movement had such an effect upon the lion, that he likewise came  to a stand; and what was still more singular, laid himself down at some  paces' distance from the stones, seemingly quite unconcerned. The  sportsman, in the mean while, did not dare to stir a step from the  spot; besides, in his flight, he had lost his powder-horn. At length,  after waiting a good half hour, the lion rose up, and retreated slowly,  step by step, as if it had a mind to steal off; but as soon as it got  to a greater distance, it began to bound away with great rapidity.    It is related that Geoffrey de la Tour, one of the knights that went  upon the first crusade to the Holy Land, heard, one day, as he rode  through a forest, a cry of distress. Hoping to rescue some unfortunate  sufferer, the knight rode boldly into the thicket; but what was his  astonishment, when he beheld a large lion, with a serpent coiled round  his body! To relieve the distressed was the duty of every knight;  therefore, with a single stroke of the sword, and regardless of the  consequences to himself, he killed the serpent, and extricated the  "]]]
