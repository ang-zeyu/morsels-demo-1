Pechlin mentions a young man,  who during a complaint originating from worms, possessed an  astonishing memory and lively imagination, both of which he nearly  lost by being cured. Haller mentions a man who was able to see in the  night, while his eyes were inflamed, but lost this power as he got  well. All these facts show, that a certain action or energy is  necessary for the performance of any of the functions of the body or  mind; and whatever increases this action will, within certain limits,  increase those functions.    Feeling is by far the most useful, extensive, and important of the  senses, and may be said indeed to be the basis of them all. Vision  would be of very little use to us, if it were not aided by the sense  of feeling; we shall afterwards see that the same observation may be  applied to the other senses. In short, it is to this sense that we  are indebted, either immediately or indirectly, for by far the  greatest part of our knowledge; for without it we should not be able  to procure any idea with respect to the magnitude, distance, shape,  heat, hardness or softness, asperity or smoothness of bodies; indeed,  if we were deprived of this sense, it is difficult to say whether we  should have any idea of the existence of any external bodies; on the  contrary, it seems probable that we should not.    LECTURE VI.  TASTE AND SMELL.    From the sense of touch we proceed naturally to that of taste, for  there seems to be less difference between these two senses than  between any of the others. The sense of taste appears to be seated  chiefly in the tongue; for any sweet substance, such as sugar,  applied to any other part of the mouth, scarcely excites the least  sensation of taste. The same may be observed with respect to any  other sapid body, which, unless it is strongly acrid or irritating,  produces no effect on any other part than the tongue; but if it is  possessed of much acrimony, it then not only affects the palate, and  uvula, but even the oesophagus.    The tongue is a muscular substance, placed in the mouth, connected by  one end with the adjacent bones and cartilages, while the other end  remains free, and easily moveable. The tongue is furnished,  particularly on its upper surface, with innumerable nervous papillae,  which are much larger than those I described as belonging to the  skin. These papillae are of a conical figure, and extremely sensible,  forming, without doubt, the true organ of taste; other papillae are  found between them, which are partly conical, and partly cylindrical.    Over the papillae of the tongue is spread a single mucous, and  semipellucid covering, which adheres firmly to them, and serves the  purpose of a cuticle.    Under these papillae are spread the muscles which make up the fleshy  part of the tongue: these are extremely numerous, and by their means  the tongue possesses the power of performing a great variety of  motions with surprising velocity.    The arteries leading to the tongue are extremely numerous; and, when  injected with a red fluid, the whole substance appears of a beautiful  red.    The tongue is likewise furnished with a large supply of nerves, some  of which undoubtedly serve to supply its muscles with nervous energy,  while others terminate in the papillae, and form the proper organ of  taste: this office seems to be performed by the third branch of the  fifth pair of nerves. The papillae, before described, are formed or  composed of a number of small nerves, arteries, and veins, firmly  united together by cellular substance. These papillae are excited to  action by the application of any sapid body; in consequence of which  they receive a greater supply of blood, become enlarged, and vastly  more sensible.    The structure of the tongue differs in different animals, which  likewise possess corresponding differences with respect to taste. In  those quadrupeds, in which it is armed with sharp points, the sense  of taste is by no means acute. The same is the case with birds and  reptiles, whose tongues are very dry and rough.    In a former lecture I took notice of a liquor which is secreted by  the glands of the mouth and neighbouring parts, which is called  saliva. This liquor acts an important part in the production of  taste; it does not differ much from water, excepting by containing a  quantity of mucilage; and nothing is sapid, or capable of affecting  the sense of taste, unless it is in some degree soluble in this  liquor. Hence earthy substances, which are nearly insoluble, have  little or no taste.    It is not, however, sufficient that the substance be possessed of  solubility alone; it is necessary likewise that it should be  possessed of saline properties, or, at least, of a kind of acrimony,  which renders it capable of stimulating the nervous papillae. Hence  it is that those substances which are less saline, and less acrid  than the saliva, have no taste.    We are capable of distinguishing various kinds of taste, but some of  them with less accuracy than others. Among the different kinds of  taste, the following have been considered by Haller, and some other  physiologists, as primitive: sweet, sour, bitter, and saline. The  others have been thought to be compounded of these; for the sense of  taste, as well as sight and hearing, is capable of perceiving  compound impressions. To these primitive tastes, Boerhaave added  alkaline, spirituous, aromatic, and some others. Of these, in  different proportions, all the varieties of tastes, which are  extremely numerous, are composed.    Some tastes are pleasant and agreeable, others disagreeable, and  scarcely tolerable: there is, however, a great diversity in this  respect experienced by different persons; for the same taste, which  is highly grateful to some, is extremely unpleasant to others.    But the most pleasant tastes, agreeably to the general laws of  sensation, which I described in the last lecture, become gradually  less pleasant, and at last disgusting; while, on the contrary, the  most disagreeable savours, such as tobacco, opium, and assafoetida,  become, by custom, not only tolerable, but highly agreeable.    Nature designed this difference of tastes that we might know and  distinguish such foods as are salutary; for we may in general  observe, that no kind of food which is healthy, and affords proper  nutriment to the body, is disagreeable to the taste; nor are any that  are ill tasted proper for our nourishment. Those substances,  therefore, which possess strong or disagreeable savours, and which,  in general, possess a power of producing great changes on our  constitution, are to be ranked as medicines, and only to be used when  the constitution is deranged; whereas, in general, those which are  pleasant, or mild tasted, are proper for nourishing the body. We are  therefore excited or prompted to receive nourishment by the pleasant  smell or taste of the food; but the avidity with which we take it  depends much on the state of the stomach, and likewise on a certain  inanition or emptiness; for the coarsest food is grateful to those  who are hungry, and whose digestion is good; whereas, to those who  have lately eaten, or whose digestive powers are impaired, the most  delicate food affords little pleasure. While we are eating, the  saliva flows into the mouth more copiously, which excites a more  acute sensation of taste. This flow of saliva is likewise frequently  excited by the smell or sight of substances agreeable to the taste,  which causes an appetite, or desire of eating, similar to that caused  by an accumulation of gastric juice in the stomach.    In brute animals, who have not, like ourselves, the advantage of  learning from each other by instruction, the faculty of taste is much  more acute, by which they are admonished to abstain from noxious or  unhealthy food. This sense, for the same reason, is more acute in  savages than in those who live in civiilsed society, which, whatever  perfection it gives to the reasoning faculties of man, certainly  diminishes the acuteness of all our senses, partly by affording fewer  inducements to exercise them, and partly by our manner of living, and  by the application of substances to the organs of sense, which tend  to vitiate them, and render them depraved.    Taste is modified by age, temperament, habit, and disease; and in  this it obeys the general laws of sensation. Children are pleased  with the taste of what is sweet, and little stimulating; as we  advance in years the taste of more stimulating substances becomes  agreeable to us; so that we are admonished by this sense to take into  the stomach the kind of nourishment fitted to each period of life. We  often, however, counteract this salutary monitor by depraving our  sense of taste, by the too free use of vinous or spirituous liquors,  which so far deadens the sense of taste, that sweet substances become  unpleasant, and nothing but acrid and stimulating things can make an  impression on our diminished and vitiated sense of taste.    This sense, as well as others, is liable to be diseased. In order  that the sense may be perfect, it is necessary that the membrane  which envelopes the nervous papillae of the tongue, and serves as a  cuticle, should neither be too thick nor too thin, too dry nor too  moist. It is necessary likewise that the qualities of the saliva be  natural; for alterations in the nature of this liquor affect very  much the sense of taste; if it is bitter, which sometimes happens in  bilious complaints, all kinds of food have a bitter taste; if it is  sweet, the food has a faint and unpleasant flavour; and if it is  acid, the food too tastes sour.    This sense is seldom observed to be too acute, unless from a vitiated  state of the cuticle, or membrane, which covers the tongue: if this  has"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27778"],[0,"Outlines of Dairy Bacteriology, 8th edition (#20)"],[1,"of spores, it is  practically impossible to destroy entirely _all_ these hardy forms. If  milk is heated at temperatures above the boiling point, as is done where  steam pressure is utilized, it can be rendered practically germ-free.  Such methods are employed where it is designed to keep milk sweet for a  long period of time. The treatment of milk by sterilization has not met  with any general favor in this country, although it has been more widely  introduced abroad. In most cases the process is carried out after the  milk is bottled; and considerable ingenuity has been exercised in the  construction of devices which will permit of the closure of the bottles  after the sterilizing process has been completed. Milks heated to so  high a temperature have a more or less pronounced boiled or cooked  taste, a condition that does not meet with general favor in this  country. The apparatus suitable for this purpose must, of necessity, be  so constructed as to withstand steam pressure, and consequently is  considerably more expensive than that required for the simpler  pasteurizing process.    ~Pasteurization.~ In this method the degree of heat used ranges from 140  deg. to 185 deg. F. and the application is made for only a limited length  of time. The process was first extensively used by Pasteur (from whom it  derives its name) in combating various maladies of beer and wine. Its  importance as a means of increasing the keeping quality of milk was not  generally recognized until a few years ago; but the method is now  growing rapidly in favor as a means of preserving milk for commercial  purposes. The method does not destroy all germ-life in milk; it affects  only those organisms that are in a growing, vegetative condition; but if  the milk is quickly cooled, it enhances the keeping quality very  materially. It is unfortunate that this same term is used in connection  with the heating of cream as a preparatory step to the use of pure  cultures in cream-ripening in butter-making. The objects to be  accomplished vary materially and the details of the two processes are  also quite different.    While pasteurizing can be performed on a small scale by the individual,  the process can also be adapted to the commercial treatment of large  quantities of milk. The apparatus necessary for this purpose is not  nearly so expensive as that used in sterilizing, a factor of importance  when other advantages are considered. In this country pasteurization has  made considerable headway, not only in supplying a milk that is designed  to serve as children's food, but even for general purposes.    ~Requirements essential in pasteurization.~ While considerable latitude  with reference to pasteurizing limits is permitted, yet there are  certain conditions which should be observed, and these, in a sense, fix  the limits that should be employed. These may be designated as (1) the  _physical_, and (2) the _biological_ requirements.    ~Physical requirements.~ _1. Avoidance of scalded or cooked taste._ The  English and American people are so averse to a scalded or cooked flavor  in milk that it is practically impossible for a highly heated product to  be sold in competition with ordinary raw milk. In pasteurization then,  care must be taken not to exceed the temperature at which a permanently  cooked flavor is developed. As previously observed, this point varies  with the period of exposure. A momentary exposure to a temperature of  about 170 deg. F. may be made without any material alteration, but if  the heat is maintained for a few minutes (ten minutes or over), a  temperature of 158 deg. to 160 deg. F. is about the maximum that can be  employed with safety.    _2. Normal creaming of the milk._ It is especially desirable that a  sharp and definite cream line be evident on the milk soon after  pasteurization. If this fails to appear, the natural inference of the  consumer is that the milk is skimmed. If the milk be heated to a  temperature sufficiently high to cause the fat-globule clusters to  disintegrate (see Figs. 22 and 23), the globules do not rise to the  surface as readily as before and the cream line remains indistinct.  Where the exposure is made for a considerable period of time (10 minutes  or more), the maximum temperature which can be used without producing  this change is about 140 deg. F.; if the exposure is made for a very  brief time, a minute or less, the milk may be heated to 158 deg.-160 F.  deg. without injuring the creaming property.    _3. No diminution in cream \"body.\"_ Coincident with this change which  takes place in the creaming of the milk is the change in body or  consistency which is noted where cream is pasteurized at too high a  temperature. For the same reason as given under (2) cream heated above  these temperatures is reduced in apparent thickness and appears to  contain less butter-fat. Of course the pasteurizing process does not  change the fat content, but its \"body\" is apparently so affected. Thus a  25 per cent. cream may seem to be no thicker or heavier than an 18 per  cent. raw cream. This real reduction in consistency naturally affects  the readiness with which the cream can be whipped.    ~Biological requirements.~ _1. Enhanced keeping quality._ In commercial  practice the essential biological requirement is expressed in the  enhanced keeping quality of the pasteurized milk. This expresses in a  practical way the reduction in germ life accomplished by the  pasteurizing process. The improvement in keeping quality depends upon  the temperature and time of exposure, but fully as much also on the way  in which the pasteurized product is handled after heating. The lowest  temperature which can be used with success to kill the active,  vegetative bacteria is about 140 deg. F., at which point it requires  about ten minutes exposure. If this period is curtailed the temperature  must be raised accordingly. An exposure to a temperature of 175 deg. F.  for a minute has approximately the same effect as the lower degree of  heat for the longer time.    The following bacteriological studies as to the effect which a variation  in temperature exerts on bacterial life in milk are of importance as  indicating the foundation for the selection of the proper limits. In the  following table the exposures were made for a uniform period (20  minutes):    _The bacterial content of milk heated at different temperatures._                              Number of bacteria per cc. in milk.                              45 deg.

F. (60 deg. C.). It should also be observed  that an increase in heat above this temperature did not materially  diminish the number of organisms present, indicating that those forms  remaining were in a spore or resistant condition. It was noted, however,  that the developing colonies grew more slowly in the plates made from the  highly heated milk, showing that their vitality was injured to a greater  extent even though not killed.    _2. Destruction of disease bacteria._ While milk should be pasteurized  so as to destroy all active, multiplying bacteria, it is particularly  important to destroy any organisms of a disease nature that might find  their way into the same. Fortunately most of the bacteria capable of  thriving in milk before or after it is drawn from the animal are not  able to form spores and hence succumb to proper pasteurization. Such is  the case with the diphtheria, cholera and typhoid organisms.    The organism that is invested with most interest in this connection is  the tubercle bacillus. On account of its more or less frequent  occurrence in milk and its reputed high powers of resistance, it may  well be taken as a standard in pasteurizing.    ~Thermal death limits of tubercle bacillus.~ Concerning the exact  temperature at which this germ is destroyed there is considerable  difference of opinion. Part of this arises from the inherent difficulty  in determining exactly when the organism is killed (due to its failure  to grow readily on artificial media), and part from the lack of uniform  conditions of exposure. The standards that previously have been most  generally accepted are those of De Man,[137] who found that thirty  minutes exposure at 149 deg. F., fifteen minutes at 155 deg. F., or ten  minutes at 167 deg. F., sufficed to destroy this germ.    More recently it has been demonstrated,[138] and these results  confirmed,[139] that if tuberculous milk is heated in closed receptacles  where the surface pellicle does not form, the vitality of this disease  germ is destroyed at 140 deg. F. in 10-15 minutes, while an exposure at  160 deg. F. requires only about one minute.[140] If the conditions of  heating are such that the surface of the milk is exposed to the air, the  resistance of bacteria is greatly increased. When heated in open vessels  Smith found that the tubercle organism was not killed in some cases where  the exposure was made for at least an hour. Russell and Hastings[141]  have shown an instance where the thermal death-point of a micrococcus  isolated from pasteurized milk was increased 12.5 deg. F., by heating it  under conditions that permitted of the formation of the scalded layer.  It is therefore apparent that apparatus used for pasteurization should  be constructed so as to"]]]
