[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2441"],[0,"The Burgess Animal Book for Children (#20)"],[1,"Mother Nature, as soon  as everybody was on hand the next morning.    \"I wouldn't be without my pockets for any thing,\" spoke up  Striped Chipmunk.    Old Mother Nature smiled.  \"You certainly do make good use of yours,\"  said she.  \"But there are others who have even greater need of  pockets, and among them are the Pocket Mice.  Of course, it is  because of their pockets that they are called Pocket Mice.  All of  these pretty little fellows live in the dry parts of the Far West  and Southwest in the same region where Longfoot the Kangaroo Rat  lives.  They are close neighbors and relatives of his.    \"Midget the Silky Pocket Mouse is one of the smallest animals in  all the Great World, so small that Whitefoot the Wood Mouse is a  giant compared with him.  He weighs less than an ounce and is a  dear little fellow.  His back and sides are yellow, and beneath  he is white.  He has quite long hind legs and a long tail, and  these show at once that he is a jumper.  In each cheek is a pocket  opening from the outside, and these pockets are lined with hair.  He is called Silky Pocket Mouse because of the fineness and  softness of his coat.  He has some larger cousins, one of them  being a little bigger than Nibbler the House Mouse.  Neighbors  and close relatives are the Spiny Pocket Mice.\"    \"Do they have spines like Prickly Porky?\" demanded Peter Rabbit.    Old Mother Nature laughed.  \"I don't wonder you ask,\" said she.  \"I think it is a foolish name myself, for they haven't any spines at  all.  Their fur isn't as fine as that of Midget, and it has all  through it long coarse hairs almost like bristles, and from these  they get their name.  The smallest of the Spiny Pocket Mice is  about the size of Nibbler the House Mouse and the largest is twice  as big.  They are more slender than their Silky cousins, and their  tails are longer in proportion to their size and have little tufts  of hair at the ends.  Of course, they have pockets in their cheeks.    \"In habits all the Pocket Mice are much alike.  They make burrows  in the ground, often throwing up a little mound with several  entrances which lead to a central passageway connecting with the  bedroom and storerooms.  By day the entrances are closed with  earth from inside, for the Mice are active only at night.  Sometimes the burrows are hidden under bushes, and sometimes  they are right out in the open.  Living as they do in a hot, dry  country, the Pocket Mice have learned to get along without  drinking water.  Their food consists mainly of a variety of  small seeds.    \"Another Mouse of the West looks almost enough like Whitefoot to  be a member of his branch of the family.  He has a beautiful  yellowish-brown coat and white waistcoat, and his feet are white.  But his tail is short in comparison with Whitefoot's and instead  of being slim is quite thick.  His fur is like velvet.  He is  called the Grasshopper Mouse.\"    \"Is that because he eats Grasshoppers?\" asked Peter Rabbit at once.    \"You've guessed it,\" laughed Old Mother Nature.  \"He is very, very  fond of Grasshoppers and Crickets.  He eats many kinds of insects,  Moths, Flies, Cutworms, Beetles, Lizards, Frogs and Scorpions.  Because of his fondness for the latter he is called the Scorpion  Mouse in some sections.  He is fond of meat when he can get it.  He also eats seeds of many kinds.  He is found all over the West  from well up in the North to the hot dry regions of the Southwest.  When he cannot find a convenient deserted burrow of some other  animal, he digs a home for himself and there raises several families  each year.  In the early evening he often utters a fine, shrill,  whistling call note.    \"Another little member of the Mouse family found clear across the  country is the Harvest Mouse.  He is never bigger than Nibbler the  House Mouse and often is much smaller.  In fact, he is one of the  smallest of the entire family.  In appearance he is much like  Nibbler, but his coat is browner and there are fine hairs on his  tail.  He loves grassy, weedy or brushy places.    \"As a rule he does little harm to man, for his food is chiefly  seeds of weeds, small wild fruits and parts of wild plants of no  value to man.  Once in a while his family becomes so large that  they do some damage in grain fields.  But this does not happen  often.  The most interesting thing about this little Mouse is the  way he builds his home.  Sometimes he uses a hole in a tree or  post and sometimes a deserted birds' nest, but more frequently  he builds a nest for himself--a little round ball of grass and  other vegetable matter.  This is placed in thick grass or weeds  close to the ground or in bushes or low trees several feet from  the ground.    \"They are well-built little houses and have one or more little  doorways on the under side when they are in bushes or trees.  Inside  is a warm, soft bed made of milkweed or cattail down, the very  nicest kind of a bed for the babies.  No one has a neater home than  the Harvest Mouse.  He is quite as much at home in bushes and low  trees as Happy Jack Squirrel is in bigger trees.  His long tail  comes in very handy then, for he often wraps it around a twig to  make his footing more secure.    \"Now this is all about the native Mice and--what is it, Peter?\"    \"You've forgotten Nibbler the House Mouse,\" replied Peter.    \"How impatient some little folks are and how fearful that their  curiosity will not be satisfied,\" remarked Old Mother Nature.  \"As  I was saying, this is all about our native Mice; that is, the Mice  who belong to this country.  And now we come to Nibbler the House  Mouse, who, like Robber the Brown Rat, has no business here at all,  but who has followed man all over the world and like Robber has  become a pest to man.\"    Peter Rabbit looked rather sheepish when he discovered that Old  Mother Nature hadn't for gotten, and resolved that in the future  he would hold his tongue.    \"Have any of you seen Nibbler?\" asked Old Mother Nature.    \"I have,\" replied Danny Meadow Mouse.  \"Once I was carried to  Farmer Brown's barn in a shock of corn and I found Nibbler living  in the barn.\"    \"It is a wonder he wasn't living in Farmer Brown's house,\" said  Old Mother Nature.  \"Probably other members of his family were.  He is perfectly at home in any building put up by man, just as  is Robber the Rat.  Because of his small size he can go where  Robber cannot.  He delights to scamper about between the walls.  Being a true Rodent he is forever gnawing holes in the corners  of rooms and opening on to pantry shelves so that he may steal  food.  He eats all sorts of food, but spoils more for man, by  running about over it, than he eats.  In barns and henhouses he  gets into the grain bins and steals a great deal of grain.    \"It is largely because of Robber the Rat and Nibbler that men keep  the Cats you all hate so.  A Cat is Nibbler's worst enemy.  Nibbler  is slender and graceful, with a long, hairless tail and ears of  good size.  He is very timid, ready to dart into his hole at the  least sound.  He raises from four to nine babies at a time and  several sets of them in a year.    \"If Mr. and Mrs. Nibbler are living in a house, their nest is made  of scraps of paper, cloth, wool and other soft things stolen from  the people who live in the house.  In getting this material they  often do great damage.  If they are living in a barn, they make  their nest of hay and any soft material they can find.    \"While Nibbler prefers to live in or close to the homes of men,  he sometimes is driven out and then takes to the fields, especially  in summer.  There he lives in all sorts of hiding places, and isn't  at all particular what the place is, if it promises safety and food  can be obtained close by.  I'm sorry Nibbler ever came to this  country.  Man brought him here and now he is here to stay and quite  as much at home as if he belonged here the way the rest of you do.    \"This finishes the lessons on the order of Rodents, the animals  related by reason of having teeth for the purpose of gnawing.  I  suspect these are the only ones in whom you take any interest, and  so you will not care to come to school any more.  Am I right?\"    \"No, marm,\" answered Happy Jack the Gray Squirrel, who, you remember,  had laughed at Peter Rabbit for wanting to go to school.  \"No, marm.  There are ever so many other people of the Green Forest and the  Green Meadows we want to know more about than we now know.  Isn't  that so?\"  Happy Jack turned to the others and every one nodded,  even Prickly Porky.    \"There is one little fellow living right near here who looks to me  as if he must be a member of the Mouse family, but he isn't like any  of the Mice you have told us about,\" continued Happy Jack.  \"He is  so small he can hide under a leaf.  I'm sure he must be a Mouse.\"    \"You mean Teeny Weeny the Shrew,\" replied Old Mother Nature, smiling  at Happy Jack.  \"He isn't a Mouse.  He isn't even a Rodent.  I'll  try to have him here to-morrow morning and we will see what we can  find out about him and his relatives.\"        CHAPTER XIX  Teeny Weeny and His Cousin    \"Of course Old Mother Nature knows, but just the same it is hard  for me not to believe that Teeny Weeny is a member of the Mouse  family,\" said Happy Jack Squirrel to Peter Rabbit, as they  scampered along to school.  \"I never have had a real good look  at him, but I've had glimpses of him lots of times and always  supposed him a little Mouse with a short tail.  It is hard to  believe that he isn't.\"    \"I hope Old Mother Nature will put him where we can get a good  look at him,\" replied Peter.  \"Perhaps when you really see him he  won't look so much like a Mouse.\"    When all had arrived Old Mother Nature began the morning lesson at  once.  \"You have learned about all the families in the order of  Rodents,\" said she, \"so now we will take up another and much smaller  order called Insectivora.  I wonder if any of you can guess what  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24416"],[0,"Life and Work in Benares and Kumaon, 1839-1877 (#20)"],[1,"as if it trenched on their dignity. Indeed the pundit  in a party that has few facilities for cooking has, as I remember well  in one instance, this honour conferred on him on account of his caste  being higher than that of those who are with him. All of every caste can  eat what he has prepared, but he helps himself first, and eats apart.    To return to the mela. The evening is well advanced before the repast is  over. We might suppose that after the stir of the day all would be ready  for sleep, and no doubt many lie down and sleep soundly; but quite a  number are too eager for the enjoyment of the fair to give themselves to  rest. Singing, drumming, and boisterous mirth go on till the small hours  of the morning, as I have known to my unpleasant experience--not at  Allahabad, but elsewhere when I have been in their close neighhourhood.    How do the vast multitudes who attend a mela, such as that of Allahabad,  dispose of themselves at night? Their arrangements are of the simplest  kind. Many wrap themselves in their sheet or blanket, if they have one,  and lie down on the ground without any idea they are enduring hardship.  Others rig out a temporary tent with sticks and a blanket over it,  creep under this, and deem themselves luxuriously accommodated. This  gathering at Allahabad is in the cold weather, and if the nights be very  cold, as they sometimes are at that season, no doubt many suffer  severely. Every now and then heavy rain falls, and then, as may be  supposed, the suffering is extreme. Sanitary precautions are of the  utmost importance where such vast crowds meet and remain together for  days, and these are taken by the authorities. They cannot, however,  provide against suffering caused by bad weather. Occasionally cholera  breaks out, and then the scenes witnessed are appalling. At the mela of  1840 the weather was good, and there was no indication of disease among  the people. Some years afterwards we were travelling towards Allahabad  at an early period of the mela, and met crowds fleeing from it on  account of the outbreak of cholera. Here and there we saw corpses at the  side of the road, occasionally without one person near, at other times  with a weeping group around, who were preparing to carry off the body to  some rivulet to have it burnt, or, as it often happens, to have it  scorched, and then left to be devoured by jackals and vultures. Some had  held on their way with weary limbs till the fell disease seized them,  and then they succumbed, lay down, and died. We remember stopping where  a young man was dying, with two or three sorrowful ones around him. We  spoke to him, but got no reply. His glazed eye told he was beyond all  human help.    One of the first things I saw at this Allahabad mela was a quantity of  human hair, and was told that it had been cut off after the fulfilment  of vows, reminding one of a custom to which we find frequent reference  in both the Old and New Testaments. I also saw a very disgusting  sight--men in stark nudity, sitting in a very composed dignified  fashion, and women approaching them with folded hands, and paying them  profound homage. These were deemed men of great sanctity, whose blessing  brought signal benefit, while their curse entailed terrible calamities.  At an early period of our residence at Benares we sometimes met these  naked creatures in the streets; but for many years they have  disappeared, as there is a magisterial order that they be flogged for  their indecency, however loud may be their pretension of sanctity. At  Allahabad there were many devotees with their tangled hair, besmeared  bodies, and _very_ scanty clothing--if what they had on could be called  clothing. These are yet seen all over the country. The time has not yet  come for stringent orders in these cases.    [Sidenote: HINDU SOCIAL FEELING.]    On the occasion of a gathering such as that of Allahabad a stranger sees  no sign of the separating influence of caste. The people move about and  mix with each other as freely as people do in Europe when assembled in  large numbers. There is nothing in caste to prevent people conversing  with each other and being on friendly terms; but the friendliness must  not go the length of eating together or of intermarriage. There are  indeed large classes deemed so low, so outside the pure Hindu castes,  that, so far as is possible, their touch is shunned, and they are not  allowed to enter temples; but even these may be spoken to and caste  purity retained. We have not in Northern India a class so low that they  must hide themselves when a Brahman appears, as Pariahs have to do in  some parts of Southern India. In fact, at Hindu melas one receives a  pleasing impression of the social character of the people, when he  observes their good humour and friendly intercourse.    We do not wonder at the popularity of these gatherings. The social  feeling is as strong among the Hindus as among any people on the face of  the earth. The vast majority lead lives of monotonous toil in places  where there is no excitement greater than that of ordinary village and  hamlet life, and to them it must be a great pleasure to resort to the  gatherings of their people, where religion, business, and amusement are  very happily combined, and where there is so much to interest,  exhilarate, and gratify them. These times are to them the red-letter  days of the year, without which life would be intolerably dull. Resort  to these gatherings no doubt involves them in toil, in expense, and  sometimes in great suffering; but they do not shrink from the cost, as  they anticipate the expected benefit.    [Sidenote: CHRISTIAN SOCIAL FEELING.]    There cannot be a doubt that Hinduism is greatly strengthened by these  melas. Judaism was greatly strengthened by the people according to the  Divine command going up thrice every year, at appointed times, to the  place where the name of the Lord was, and by their repairing in vast  numbers once a year to their sacred capital after they had become widely  scattered among the nations. Muhammadans, by long journeys and perilous  voyages, make their way to Mecca and Medina, their sacred cities, and  make it a point to be present at the most sacred season, when many  thousands are assembled. These pilgrims return to their homes more  devoted than ever to Islam. It would be strange if Christianity, which  above every other religion aims at producing and sustaining the feeling  of universal brotherhood, did not avail itself of this social feeling,  to which so much scope is given in human religions, and which is so  potent in confirming the devotion of their adherents. Our blessed  Saviour, the Head of the Church, has by the institution of Churches, and  the instruction given to them through His Apostles, provided for the  fellowship of His people; and the occasional gathering of the members of  different Churches, to which the principles of the Gospel point, and to  which it gives the fullest sanction, presents precious opportunities for  the manifestation and exercise of the brotherliness so characteristic of  the kingdom of heaven which our Lord came to set up on the earth.    [Illustration]          CHAPTER XI.    THE OBJECT OF MISSIONS, AND VARIOUS MODES OF OPERATION.      There is no difference of opinion among missionaries as to the object  for which they have gone to the heathen. They are all agreed their  object is to make known the Gospel, the message of salvation, to all to  whom they obtain access, to explain its nature, and press its claims on  their acceptance. To this nothing can be held superior; to this  everything must be deemed subordinate. To place anything above it, or  even beside it, would be to lose sight of the very _raison d'etre_ of  their missionary calling.    [Sidenote: VARIETY OF EFFORT NEEDED.]    There may be, however, and there often is, a difference of opinion as to  the line of operation best fitted to secure success. Missionaries find  themselves in presence of widely-separated classes, who must be  approached in different ways, and it is the part of wisdom to find out  the most direct path to their understanding, conscience, and heart.  About these modes of operation there has often been marked diversity of  opinion, some pleading for one mode, and others for another. It cannot  be denied that in the discussion thus carried on there has often been  one-sidedness, resulting in some cases from natural liking, in some from  special fitness, in others from the peculiarities of the sphere into  which missionaries find themselves introduced so that they fail to  realize the peculiarities in the qualifications, likings, and spheres of  their brethren, who are as eager as themselves to bring the people to  the feet of the Lord Jesus. Hinduism is a strong fortress, and those who  assail it by hurling at it--if I may so speak--the red-hot shot of  exposure of its errors, and the fire of the truth as it is in Jesus, act  very unwisely in depreciating those who are quietly preparing the  ammunition required for carrying on the siege, or are undermining the  foundations, and thus preparing for entering the breach. The erection of  the Christian Church in India is a most arduous, and at the same time a  most glorious, enterprise, and a variety of workmen is required. Those  who handle the trowel and the hammer act very unwisely in depreciating  those who plan the structure, clear away the rubbish, and lay the  foundation, or who in other ways help on the building. These  illustrations require no enlargement. They indicate the views which  every succeeding period of my missionary career has led me to entertain  with increasing firmness. The translation and revision of the  Scriptures, the preparation of Christian tracts and books, teaching in  schools and colleges, taking charge of orphanages, the going among the  people in city, town, and hamlet, wherever they can be reached, to speak  to"]]]
