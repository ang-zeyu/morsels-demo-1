He took part  in the battle of the Brandywine; and at the battle of Germantown he  led his regiment against the British opposing him, drove them back, and  pushed on to the center of the town, where he captured a regiment of the  enemy. Shortly after this, while engaged in a skirmish, his courage led  him too close to the British. He was knocked down, severely wounded by  a bayonet thrust, and taken prisoner. He was sent to the British prison  ship in New York Harbor. He was there treated with so much cruelty that  he appealed to his government for relief. In response to that appeal,  Thomas Jefferson, who was then governor of Virginia, wrote him a  personal letter, in which he said, \"We know that the ardent spirit and  hatred of tyranny which brought you into your present situation  will enable you to bear up against it with the firmness which has  distinguished you as a soldier, and look forward with pleasure to the  day when events shall take place against which the wounded spirit of  your enemies will find no comfort, even from reflections on the most  refined of the cruelties with which they have glutted themselves.\"    General Matthews was not exchanged until the close of the war. He then  joined the Southern army under General Greene, and commanded the Third  Virginia Regiment. While in the South, he bought a tract of land on  Broad River, known as the Goose Pond. He settled there with his family  in 1784. The fame he had won as a soldier made General Matthews at that  time the principal man in Georgia. He was elected governor in 1786. When  his term expired, he was sent to Congress. In 1794-95 he was again made  governor; and it was at this time, that, contrary to all expectations,  he was prevailed on to sign the Yazoo Act. No charge of corruption was  ever made against him. No thief or swindler was ever bold enough to try  to bribe such a high-spirited and fearless man. But excitement in  the State ran so high, that General Matthews was ruined so far as his  influence was concerned. He left Georgia, and never afterwards made the  State his home for any long period.    In 1811 a lot of runaway negroes, ruffians, and lawless men congregated  in Florida in such numbers that they were able to get control of  affairs. They formed a government of their own, and then petitioned  the United States to make Florida one of their territories. President  Madison appointed General Matthews the agent of the United States to  negotiate with the \"constituted authorities\" for the annexation of  Florida. General Matthews made a treaty with those who were in control  of Florida; but Spain protested, and the President finally declared that  the treaty had not been made with the \"constituted authorities.\"    General Matthews was not a learned man (he knew nothing of books),  and he could not understand the fuss that was made over the term  \"constituted authorities.\" He became very angry with the President, said  that that officer had a cowardly fear of Spain and Great Britain, and  declared that he would go to Washington to \"thrash\" the President. He  actually set out on that errand; but the fatigue and exposure which he  had experienced in Florida, and the high state of excitement under  which he labored, threw him into a fever while he was on his journey to  Washington, and he died in Augusta in March, 1812.    Previous to his Florida appointment, General Matthews had been nominated  to be governor of the Territory of Mississippi by President Adams; but  the opposition was so great that the President withdrew the nomination.  When General Matthews heard of this, he promptly set out for  Philadelphia to call the President to account. He rode to Mr. Adams's  house, gave a loud knock on the door, and told the servant he wished  to see the President. The servant said the President was engaged; but  General Matthews bristled with anger at the bare thought that any man,  even the President, could be engaged in any business more important  than talking to George Matthews, late colonel of the Virginia line, and  governor of the State of Georgia. Therefore he told the servant to go at  once and tell the President that a gentleman wished to speak to him;  and he added, that, if the message was not carried at once, the servant  would find his head taken from his shoulders. General Matthews wore his  Revolutionary sword and cocked hat, and he succeeded in convincing the  servant that he was not to be trifled with. He was promptly admitted  into the presence of Mr. Adams, and, with the touch of Irish brogue he  had caught from his father, he made himself and his business known. He  introduced himself, and then said to the President,--    \"Now, sir, I understand that you nominated me to the Senate of these  United States, to be governor of the Territory of Mississippi, and that  afterwards you took back the nomination. Sir, if you had known me, you  would not have taken the nomination back. If you did not know me, you  should not have nominated me to so important an office. Now, sir, unless  you can satisfy me, your station as President of these United States  shall not screen you from my vengeance.\"    Mr. Adams at once made himself agreeable, for he had nothing but good  will for the stanch Georgia Federalist. The outcome of the meeting was  that the President promised to appoint the general's son John to be  supervisor of the revenue, and this promise he carried out.    Governor Gilmer, in his racy reminiscences of the people who settled  in the Broad River region, draws an interesting portrait of General  Matthews. He describes him as a short, thick man, with stout legs, on  which he stood very straight. \"He carried his head rather thrown back.  His features were full and bluff, his hair light red, and his complexion  fair and florid. He admitted no superior but General Washington. He  spoke of his services to his country as unsurpassed except by those of  his great chief. He wore a three-cornered cocked hat, top boots, a shirt  full ruffled at the bosom and wrists, and sometimes a long sword at  his side. To listen to his talk about himself, his children, and his  affairs, one would have thought that he was but a puff of wind. Trade  or talk of history with him, and he was found to be one of the shrewdest  of men. Fight with him, and he never failed to act the hero. He was  unlearned. He spelled 'coffee' k-a-u-g-h-p-h-y. He wrote 'Congress' with  a K.\"    When it is considered that he had small opportunity to train himself in  any direction except rough fighting, General Matthews must be regarded  as one of the most remarkable men of his time.    Another remarkable man who figured largely in both the military and  political history of the State was General John Clarke, son of the  famous Elijah Clarke. John Clarke became a soldier in the Revolutionary  War when a mere boy. He had followed his father to camp, and remained  with him. He took part in many skirmishes; but at the battle of Kettle  Creek, in Wilkes County, he distinguished himself by his coolness and  courage. He fought through the war. He was made a lieutenant at sixteen  years of age, and when the war ended he was a major. After the war he  was made a brigadier, and then a major general of the militia. After  aiding to run the British out of the State, and subduing the Tories,  General Clarke turned his attention to the Indians. At the battle  of Jacks Creek, in Walton County, in 1787, he greatly distinguished  himself, having charge of one of the wings of the Georgia forces.    It was natural that a man raised in camp, and brought up in the midst of  the rough and tough elements that are collected together there, should  possess qualities not calculated to fit him for the polite transactions  that take place in drawing rooms and parlors. General Clarke's  self-reliance was extreme. Having commanded men from the time he was  sixteen, it was natural that his temper and his manners should be  offensive, to some extent, to those who were not thoughtful enough to  make due allowance for these things. It thus happened that when peace  came, John Clarke's methods and practices made him many bitter enemies.  On the other hand, the sterling qualities of his character made him many  strong friends.    Coming out of the war with neither trade nor profession, and with only  the rudiments of an education, John Clarke was compelled to turn his  attention to politics. With him politics was simply a modified form of  war. He had never given any quarter to the Tories, and he gave small  quarter to his political enemies. But he was as faithful to his friends  in politics as he had been to the cause of American liberty. He was  uncompromising, whether dealing with friends or enemies, and his temper  was such that he regarded his opponents as his personal enemies. Of  his political career, mention will be made in another place. It is  sufficient to say that a quarrel he had with a judge divided the people  of the State into two parties, and the contest between them was carried  on for several years. The prejudices that sprang up in that contest  lasted for more than a generation, and strong traces of them are to be  found in estimates of General Clarke's character written long after he  was dead.    Only a man of the strongest character, and possessing the most  remarkable qualities, could have made such a marked impression on the  political history of a commonwealth.            AFTER THE REVOLUTION.    [Illustration: After the Revolution 152]    The Revolution came to an end in Georgia when, on the 11th of July,  1782, Savannah was taken possession of by the American troops under  General Anthony Wayne. It ended for the whole country when, on the 30th  of November of the same year, the treaty of peace was signed at Paris  between the United States and Great Britain. The King of Great Britain  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24737"],[0,"The Children of Odin: The Book of Northern Myths (#20)"],[1,"you,  Andvari, snatched from the heap.\"    \"I snatched nothing,\" said the Dwarf. But he shook with anger and his  teeth gnashed together and froth came on his lips. \"I snatched nothing  from the heap.\"    But Loki pulled up his arm and there fell to the ground the ring that  Andvari had hidden under his armpit.    It was the most precious thing in all the hoard. Had it been left with  him Andvari would have thought that he still possessed a treasure, for  this ring of itself could make gold. It was made out of gold that was  refined of all impurities and it was engraven with a rune of power.    Loki took up this most precious ring and put it on his finger. Then the  Dwarf screamed at him, turning his thumbs toward him in a curse:         The ring with the rune       Of power upon it:       May it weigh down your fortune,       And load you with evil,       You, Loki, and all       Who lust to possess       The ring I have cherished.    As Andvari uttered this curse Loki saw a figure rise up in the cave and  move toward him. As this figure came near he knew who it was: Gulveig, a  Giant woman who had once been in Asgard.    Far back in the early days, when the Gods had come to their holy hill  and before Asgard was built, three women of the Giants had come amongst  the AEsir. After the Three had been with them for a time, the lives of  the AEsir changed. Then did they begin to value and to hoard the gold  that they had played with. Then did they think of war. Odin hurled his  spear amongst the messengers that came from the Vanir, and war came into  the world.    The Three were driven out of Asgard. Peace was made with the Vanir. The  Apples of Lasting Youth were grown in Asgard. The eagerness for gold was  curbed. But never again were the AEsir as happy as they were before the  women came to them from the Giants.    Gulveig was one of the Three who had blighted the early happiness of the  Gods. And, behold, she was in the cave where Andvari had hoarded his  treasure and with a smile upon her face she was advancing toward Loki.    \"So, Loki,\" she said, \"thou seest me again. And Odin who sent thee to  this cave will see me again. Lo, Loki! I go to Odin to be thy messenger  and to tell him that thou comest with Andvari's hoard.\"    And speaking so, and smiling into his face, Gulveig went out of the cave  with swift and light steps. Loki drew the ends of the Magic Net together  and gathering all the treasures in its meshes he, too, went out.    Odin, the Eldest of the Gods, stood leaning on his spear and looking at  the skin of the otter that was spread out before him. One came into the  dwelling swiftly. Odin looked and saw that she who had come in on such  swift, glad feet was Gulveig who, once with her two companions, had  troubled the happiness of the Gods. Odin raised his spear to cast it at  her.    \"Lay thy spear down, Odin,\" she said. \"I dwelt for long in the Dwarf's  cave. But thy word unloosed me, and the curse said over Andvari's ring  has sent me here. Lay thy spear down, and look on me, O Eldest of the  Gods.    \"Thou didst cast me out of Asgard, but thy word has brought me to come  back to thee. And if ye two, Odin and Loki, have bought yourselves free  with gold and may enter Asgard, surely I, Gulveig, am free to enter  Asgard also.\"    Odin lowered his spear, sighing deeply. \"Surely it is so, Gulveig,\" he  said. \"I may not forbid thee to enter Asgard. Would I had thought of  giving the man Kvasir's Mead or Mimir's well water rather than this gold  as a recompense.\"    As they spoke Loki came into Hreidmar's dwelling. He laid on the floor  the Magic Net. Old Hreidmar with his sharp eyes, and huge Fafnir, and  lean and hungry-looking Regin came in to gaze on the gold and gems that  shone through the meshes. They began to push each other away from gazing  at the gold. Then Hreidmar cried out, \"No one may be here but these two  kings and I while we measure out the gold and gems and see whether the  recompense be sufficient. Go without, go without, sons of mine.\"    Then Fafnir and Regin were forced to go out of the dwelling. They went  out slowly, and Gulveig went with them, whispering to both.    With shaking hands old Hreidmar spread out the skin that once covered  his son. He drew out the ears and the tail and the paws so that every  single hair could be shown. For long he was on his hands and knees, his  sharp eyes searching, searching over every line of the skin. And still  on his knees he said, \"Begin now, O kings, and cover with a gem or a  piece of gold every hair on the skin that was my son's.\"    Odin stood leaning on his spear, watching the gold and gems being paid  out. Loki took the gold--the ingots, and the lumps and the circlets; he  took the gems--the rubies, and the emeralds and the sapphires, and he  began to place them over each hair. Soon the middle of the skin was all  covered. Then he put the gems and the gold over the paws and the tail.  Soon the otter-skin was so glittering that one would think it could  light up the world. And still Loki went on finding a place where a gem  or a piece of gold might be put.    At last he stood up. Every gem and every piece of gold had been taken  out of the net. And every hair on the otter's skin had been covered with  a gem or a piece of gold.    And still old Hreidmar on his hands and knees was peering over the skin,  searching, searching for a hair that was not covered. At last he lifted  himself up on his knees. His mouth was open, but he was speechless. He  touched Odin on the knees, and when Odin bent down he showed him a hair  upon the lip that was left uncovered.    \"What meanest thou?\" Loki cried, turning upon the crouching man.    \"Your ransom is not paid yet--look, here is still a hair uncovered. You  may not go until every hair is covered with gold or a gem.\"    \"Peace, old man,\" said Loki roughly. \"All the Dwarf's hoard has been  given thee.\"    \"Ye may not go until every hair has been covered,\" Hreidmar said again.    \"There is no more gold or gems,\" Loki answered.    \"Then ye may not go,\" cried Hreidmar, springing up.    It was true. Odin and Loki might not leave that dwelling until the  recompense they had agreed to was paid in full. Where now would the AEsir  go for gold?    And then Odin saw the gleam of gold on Loki's finger: it was the ring he  had forced from Andvari. \"Thy fingerring,\" said Odin. \"Put thy  fingerring over the hair on the otter's skin.\"    Loki took off the ring that was engraved with the rune of power, and he  put it on the lip-hair of the otter's skin. Then Hreidmar clapped his  hands and screamed aloud. Huge Fafnir and lean and hungry-looking Regin  came within, and Gulveig came behind them. They stood around the skin of  the son and the brother that was all glittering with gold and gems. But  they looked at each other more than they looked on the glittering mass,  and very deadly were the looks that Fafnir and Regin cast upon their  father and cast upon each other.    Over Bifroest, the Rainbow Bridge, went all of the AEsir and the Vanir  that had been at old AEgir's feast--Frey and Freya, Frigga, Iduna, and  Sif; Tyr with his sword and Thor in his chariot drawn by the goats. Loki  came behind them, and behind them all came Odin, the Father of the Gods.  He went slowly with his head bent, for he knew that an unwelcome one was  following--Gulveig, who once had been cast out of Asgard and whose  return now the Gods might not gainsay.          PART III    THE WITCH'S HEART    [Illustration]    FOREBODING IN ASGARD      What happened afterwards is to the shame of the Gods, and mortals may  hardly speak of it. Gulveig the Witch came into Asgard, for Heimdall  might not forbid her entrance. She came within and she had her seat  amongst the AEsir and the Vanir. She walked through Asgard with a smile  upon her face, and where she walked and where she smiled Care and dire  Foreboding came.    Those who felt the care and the foreboding most deeply were Bragi the  Poet and his wife, the fair and simple Iduna, she who gathered the  apples that kept age from the Dwellers in Asgard. Bragi ceased to tell  his never-ending tale. Then one day, overcome by the fear and the  foreboding that was creeping through Asgard, Iduna slipped down  Ygdrassil, the World Tree, and no one was left to pluck the apples with  which the AEsir and the Vanir stayed their youth.    Then were all the Dwellers in Asgard in sore dismay. Strength and beauty  began to fade from all. Thor found it hard to lift Mioelnir, his great  hammer, and the flesh under Freya's necklace lost its white radiance.  And still Gulveig the Witch walked smiling through Asgard, although now  she was hated by all.    It was Odin and Frey who went in search of Iduna. She would have been  found and brought back without delay if Frey had had with him the magic  sword that he had bartered for Gerda. In his search he had to strive  with one who guarded the lake wherein Iduna had hidden herself. Beli was  the one he strove against. He overcame him in the end with a weapon made  of stags' antlers. Ah, it was not then but later that Frey lamented the  loss of his sword: it was when the Riders of Muspell came against  Asgard, and the Vanir, who might have prevailed, prevailed not because  of the loss of Frey's sword.    They found Iduna and they brought her back. But still Care and  Foreboding crept through Asgard. And it was known, too, that the witch  Gulveig was changing the thoughts of the Gods.    At last Odin had to judge Gulveig. He judged her and decreed her death.  And only Gungnir, the spear of Odin, might slay Gulveig, who was not of  mortal race.    Odin hurled Gungnir. The spear went through Gulveig. But still she stood  smiling at the Gods. A second time Odin hurled his spear. A second time  Gungnir pierced the witch. She stood livid as one dead but fell not  down. A third time Odin hurled his spear. And now, pierced for the third  time, the witch gave a"]]]
