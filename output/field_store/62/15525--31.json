In twenty minutes his great megaphone ears, so close  to the ground, caught a regular sound--crunch, crunch, crunch--the  tramp of a human foot, and he started up to see the man with the  shining stick in his hand, now drawing near.    Warhorse bounded out and away for the fence. Never once did he rise to  a \"spy-hop\" till the wire and rails were between him and his foe, an  unnecessary precaution as it chanced, for the man was watching the  trail and saw nothing of the Rabbit.    Jack skimmed along, keeping low and looking out for other enemies. He  knew now that the man was on his track, and the old instinct born of  ancestral trouble with Weasels was doubtless what prompted him to do  the double trail. He ran in a long, straight course to a distant fence,  followed its far side for fifty yards, then doubling back he retraced  his trail and ran off in a new direction till he reached another of his  dens or forms. He had been out all night and was very ready to rest,  now that the sun was ablaze on the snow; but he had hardly got the  place a little warmed when the \"tramp, tramp, tramp\" announced the  enemy, and he hurried away.    After a half-a-mile run he stopped on a slight rise and marked the man  still following, so he made a series of wonderful quirks in his trail,  a succession of blind zigzags that would have puzzled most trailers;  then running a hundred yards past a favorite form, he returned to it  from the other side, and settled to rest, sure that now the enemy would  be finally thrown off the scent.    It was slower than before, but still it came--\"tramp, tramp, tramp.\"    Jack awoke, but sat still. The man tramped by on the trail one hundred  yards in front of him, and as he went on, Jack sprang out unseen,  realizing that this was an unusual occasion needing a special effort.  They had gone in a vast circle around the home range of the Warhorse  and now were less than a mile from the farm-house of the black Dog.  There was that wonderful board fence with the happily planned hen-hole.  It was a place of good memory--here more than once he had won, here  especially he had baffled the Greyhound.    These doubtless were the motive thoughts rather than any plan of  playing one enemy against another, and Warhorse bounded openly across  the snow to the fence of the big black Dog.    The hen-hole was shut, and Warhorse, not a little puzzled, sneaked  around to find another, without success, until, around the front, here  was the gate wide open, and inside lying on some boards was the big  Dog, fast asleep. The Hens were sitting hunched up in the warmest  corner of the yard. The house Cat was gingerly picking her way from  barn to kitchen, as Warhorse halted in the gateway.    The black form of his pursuer was crawling down the far white prairie  slope. Jack hopped quietly into the yard. A long-legged Rooster, that  ought to have minded his own business, uttered a loud cackle as he saw  the Rabbit hopping near. The Dog lying in the sun raised his head and  stood up, and Jack's peril was dire. He squatted low and turned himself  into a gray clod. He did it cleverly, but still might have been lost  but for the Cat. Unwittingly, unwillingly, she saved him. The black Dog  had taken three steps toward the Warhorse, though he did not know the  Rabbit was there, and was now blocking the only way of escape from the  yard, when the Cat came round the corner of the house, and leaping to a  window-ledge brought a flower-pot rolling down. By that single awkward  act she disturbed the armed neutrality existing between herself and the  Dog. She fled to the barn, and of course a flying foe is all that is  needed to send a Dog on the war-path. They passed within thirty feet of  the crouching Rabbit. As soon as they were well gone, Jack turned, and  with-out even a \"Thank you, Pussy,\" he fled to the open and away on the  hard-beaten road.    The Cat had been rescued by the lady of the house; the Dog was once  more sprawling on the boards when the man on Jack's trail arrived. He  carried, not a gun, but a stout stick, sometimes called \"dog-medicine,\"  and that was all that prevented the Dog attacking the enemy of his prey.    This seemed to be the end of the trail. The trick, whether planned or  not, was a success, and the Rabbit got rid of his troublesome follower.    Next day the stranger made another search for the Jack and found, not  himself, but his track. He knew it by its tail-mark, its long leaps and  few spy-hops, but with it and running by it was the track of a smaller  Rabbit. Here is where they met, here they chased each other in play,  for no signs of battle were there to be seen; here they fed or sat  together in the sun, there they ambled side by side, and here again  they sported in the snow, always together. There was only one  conclusion: this was the mating season. This was a pair of  Jack-rabbits--the Little Warhorse and his mate.      IV    Next summer was a wonderful year for the Jack-rabbits. A foolish law  had set a bounty on Hawks and Owls and had caused a general massacre of  these feathered policemen. Consequently the Rabbits had multiplied in  such numbers that they now were threatening to devastate the country.    The farmers, who were the sufferers from the bounty law, as well as the  makers of it, decided on a great Rabbit drive. All the county was  invited to come, on a given morning, to the main road north of the  county, with the intention of sweeping the whole region up-wind and at  length driving the Rabbits into a huge corral of close wire netting.  Dogs were barred as unmanageable, and guns as dangerous in a crowd; but  every man and boy carried a couple of long sticks and a bag full of  stones. Women came on horseback and in buggies; many carried rattles or  horns and tins to make a noise. A number of the buggies trailed a  string of old cans or tied laths to scrape on the wheel-spokes, and  thus add no little to the deafening clatter of the drive. As Rabbits  have marvellously sensitive hearing, a noise that is distracting to  mankind, is likely to prove bewildering to them.    The weather was right, and at eight in the morning the word to advance  was given. The line was about five miles long at first, and there was a  man or a boy every thirty or forty yards. The buggies and riders kept  perforce almost entirely to the roads; but the beaters were supposed,  as a point of honor, to face everything, and keep the front unbroken.  The advance was roughly in three sides of a square. Each man made as  much noise as he could, and threshed every bush in his path. A number  of Rabbits hopped out. Some made for the lines, to be at once assailed  by a shower of stones that laid many of them low. One or two did get  through and escaped, but the majority were swept before the drive. At  first the number seen was small, but before three miles were covered  the Rabbits were running ahead in every direction. After five  miles--and that took about three hours--the word for the wings to close  in was given. The space between the men was shortened up till they were  less than ten feet apart, and the whole drive converged on the corral  with its two long guide wings or fences; the end lines joined these  wings, and the surround was complete. The drivers marched rapidly now;  scores of the Rabbits were killed as they ran too near the beaters.  Their bodies strewed the ground, but the swarms seemed to increase; and  in the final move, before the victims were cooped up in the corral, the  two-acre space surrounded was a whirling throng of skurrying, jumping,  bounding Rabbits. Round and round they circled and leaped, looking for  a chance to escape; but the inexorable crowd grew thicker as the ring  grew steadily smaller, and the whole swarm was forced along the chute  into the tight corral, some to squat stupidly in the middle, some to  race round the outer wall, some to seek hiding in corners or under each  other.    And the Little Warhorse--where was he in all this? The drive had swept  him along, and he had been one of the first to enter the corral. But a  curious plan of selection had been established. The pen was to be a  death-trap for the Rabbits, except the best, the soundest. And many  were there that were unsound; those that think of all wild animals as  pure and perfect things, would have been shocked to see how many halt,  maimed, and diseased there were in that pen of four thousand or five  thousand Jack-rabbits.    It was a Roman victory--the rabble of prisoners was to be butchered.  The choicest were to be reserved for the arena. The arena? Yes, that is  the Coursing Park.    In that corral trap, prepared beforehand for the Rabbits, were a number  of small boxes along the wall, a whole series of them, five hundred at  least, each large enough to hold one Jack.    In the last rush of driving, the swiftest Jacks got first to the pen.  Some were swift and silly; when once inside they rushed wildly round  and round. Some were swift and wise; they quickly sought the hiding  afforded by the little boxes; all of these were now full. Thus five  hundred of the swiftest and wisest had been selected, in, not by any  means an infallible way, but the simplest and readiest. These five  hundred were destined to be coursed by Greyhounds. The surging mass of  over four thousand were ruthlessly given to slaughter.    Five hundred little boxes with five hundred bright-eyed Jack-rabbits  were put on the train that day, and among them was Little Jack Warhorse.      V    Rabbits take their troubles lightly, and it is not to be supposed that  any great terror was felt by the boxed Jacks, once the uproar of the  massacre was over; and when they reached the Coursing Park near the  great city and were turned out one by one, very gently,--yes, gently;  the Roman guards were careful of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22849"],[0,"The History of Tasmania , Volume II (#20)"],[1," or the utility of that office, does not  belong to this work to discuss. By treaty with Sir George Gipps, the  government of Van Diemen's Land agreed to pay a sum annually for each  ten who might survive. The deportation was sanctioned by the blacks  themselves: the certificate, which bears their signatures, might be  supposed to represent a congress of heroes, or the pack of a  huntsman--names, which are chiefly borne by dogs and princes.[22] They  were anxious for the change, but quite incapable of estimating its  results. A party of twenty-two therefore accompanied Mr. Robinson, but  the issue was disastrous: called away by the duties of his office, he  could not extend to them a proper supervision: they were again exposed,  in another land, to their old adversaries and seducers, the  stock-keepers: they were too few to form a village, and death thinned  their numbers: two returned to Van Diemen's Land, and afterwards to  Flinders'. Of the rest, two were executed for murder. Mr. Batman had in  his house at Port Phillip, a native woman and two boys; but the New  Hollanders were rather the objects of aversion than sympathy: and,  fearful of their violence, the Tasmanians avoided their company, and  showed no disposition to forsake their protector.    During the whole period of their residence at Flinders' Island, it does  not appear that any white man on the station, or even of their own  colour, had preferred a criminal charge against one of them. The  commandant, as magistrate, possessed a summary jurisdiction; and the  restrictions in his court he could supplement with the forms and  ensignia of power. A late commandant, when he sentenced to small  penalties for petty offences, sat at night; and to impress their  imaginations, the hall of justice was guarded with drawn swords.    FOOTNOTES:    [Footnote 22: Achilles, Ajax, Buonaparte, King George, Hannibal, Peter  Pindar, Neptune, Tippoo Saib, Washington. A few only bore the names of  ordinary mortals.]        SECTION IX.    The advances towards the final extinction of the natives, have been more  rapid than was expected; but the certainty of that event was never the  subject of doubt. Sir George Murray, on the 5th November, 1830,  anticipated, and wrote down their fate; and inferred, from their  decrease, that at no distant period the whole race would become extinct:  but he declared that the adoption of any course of conduct, with this  design, either avowed or secret, would leave an indelible stain upon the  government of Great Britain! It will be seen, however, that the progress  of decay was never arrested for a moment. The mortality at Brune and  Swan Islands was not less than at Flinders'; but from 1832, a regular  account has been preserved.[23]    Of the forty-five landed at Oyster Cove, in 1847, thirteen  were men, twenty-two women, and ten children. Such has been the progress  of their decline, and with numbers so inconsiderable, the problem of  their fate is solved.    The original amount of the natives has been a question much debated:  like a procession in a circle, a population in motion, when not  personally distinguished, will appear more numerous than the actual  census. Mr. Kelly, who often had passed the coasts, calculated them at,  originally, 7,000, but he guessed their number to be 5,000 in 1830: the  obvious error of the last estimate, would naturally suggest a doubt with  reference to the former. Several hundreds were, however, seen in one  assembly, within the last thirty years. At Hobart Town and Launceston,  from one to two hundred have appeared together. It was their custom to  distribute themselves in parties, of from forty to fifty each. Their  fires, kindled on the sea shore, were often left burning, when they had  moved on to the next stage; and those who saw the flames from  ship-board, concluded that aborigines were lying around them, and thus  telling their numbers by the fires, they were often greatly deceived.  The rapidity of their movements led to the same mistake: they appeared  at places sufficient to establish an _alibi_, according to the current  measures of distance. They had innumerable paths which shorten a  journey, then unknown to the English: it was thus, that they were twice  reckoned, even when carefully counted. No reliance, however, will be  placed by persons of experience on the rumour of numbers. Nearly all who  report an assembly, judge by imagination rather than minute inspection;  thus, mobs are spoken of as tens or hundreds of thousands, without any  intention to mislead. It will be the hope of the humane, that the lowest  estimate is the true one: it can hardly be doubted, however, that they  were originally from 4,000 to 5,000: they were estimated by Mr. Robinson  at 700, when he commenced his mission; 203 were captured--many, in the  mean time, fell by unknown violence and perpetual persecution: a  thousand muskets were charged for their destruction.    The causes of their diminution in Tasmania have been already stated; but  some of these continued their operation even after the capture: their  natural consequences followed. Towards the last days of their savage  life, the sexes were disproportionate, although the balance was partly  restored by associating the women who had been longer in captivity, with  the men whose wives had died; but many of these women had become  licentious, and by an extraordinary oversight the government permitted  unmarried convicts and others to have them in charge, or to assist in  the preliminary labor of their establishment: the result need not be  told. The infant children had perished, by the misery or contrivance of  their parents: thus in 1838, of eighty-two there were only fourteen  children, and of the remainder, eight had attained the usual term of  human life: many who surrendered, were exhausted by sickness, fatigue,  and decripitude. They were the worn out relics of their nation, and they  came in to lie down and die.    The assumption of clothing occasioned many deaths: they were sometimes  drenched with rain--perspiration was repressed, and inflammatory  diseases followed: the licentiousness, and occasional want of the few  last years, generated disorders, which a cold brought to a crisis. Among  savages, the blanket has sometimes slain more than the sword: it  destroyed the Indian of North America, and even threatened the New  Zealander with a similar fate.[24] The abundant supply of food, and  which followed destitution, tended to the same result: it was a  different diet. The habits of the chase were superseded, and perhaps  discouraged: the violent action to which they had been accustomed; the  dancing, shouting, hurling the waddy and the spear--climbing for the  opossum--diving, and leaping from rock to rock--assisted the animal  functions, and developed muscular power. To continue them required the  occasion, as well as the permission; but the stimulus was gone.    It is said, by writers not favorable to the establishment at Flinders',  that attempts to force the customs and habits of a civilised people were  unreasonably, and even ridiculously severe. However docile the blacks,  and generous the intention of their teachers, the physical effects of a  total change in the habits of a race are not to be disputed, or that  what may be harmless when the result of choice, and founded on new  mental and physical stimulants, is dangerous when the mind is vacant,  and the objects of civilised exertion unappreciated. Perhaps, no one is  blameable. In their social circumstances, we may indeed trace the  occasion of decay, but they were no longer produced by cruelty.    There were, other causes. The site of the settlement was unhealthy: they  were often destitute of good water; the tanks preserved an insufficient  supply. It is admitted that they frequently suffered this lack; but it  is stated, that they had sufficient allowed them when sick!    It is, however, clear, that many perished by that strange disease, so  often fatal to the soldiers and peasants of Switzerland, who die in  foreign lands from regret of their native country. They were within  sight of Tasmania, and as they beheld its not distant but forbidden  shore, they were often deeply melancholy: to this point the testimony of  Mr. Robinson is decisive, though not solitary.[25] They suffered much  from mental irritation: when taken with disease, they often refused  sustenance, and died in delirium. The wife, or the husband in perfect  health, when bereaved, would immediately sicken, and rapidly pine  away.[26]    Count Strzelecki has propounded a curious notion of the laws of  extinction, in reference to this race. He states that the mother of a  half-caste can never produce a black child, and thus the race dies. His  statement would need the most positive and uniform testimony; but it may  be added to the curiosities of literature. The decrease of population  among the inferior race, when harassed or licentious, is certain; but  surely there is nothing occult in this, or requiring further explanation  than is afforded by human cruelty and vice.    Among those who survive, is the wife of the native Walter George  Arthur, the half-caste daughter of Sarah an aboriginal woman. [Looking  lately at a picture of Don Quixote, she pointed him out as the man who  fought with the windmill.] Her mother has a younger son, now or lately  at the Queen's School, and of pure aboriginal blood. A natural law, by  which the extinction of a race is predicted, will not admit of such  serious deviations.    In 1844, a Finance Committee of the Legislative Council proposed the  restoration of the natives to this colony. The frequent reference to  head-quarters by the officers in charge, perplexed the government; who  alleged that the distance permitted the oppression of the natives, and  exposed them to the caprice of their guardians. The measure was delayed  for four years; but in 1847, the dismissal of"]]]
