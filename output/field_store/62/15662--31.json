The most thoroughgoing proscription of  Confederates was found in the constitutions of Mississippi, Alabama, and  Virginia; and in these states the voter must also purge himself of guilt  by agreeing to accept the \"civil and political equality of all men\" or  by supporting reconstruction. Only in South Carolina and Louisiana were  race lines abolished by law.    The legislative work of the conventions was more interesting than the  constitution making. By ordinance the legality of Negro marriages was  dated from November 1867, or some date later than had been fixed by the  white conventions of 1865. Mixed schools were provided in some States;  militia for the black districts but not for the white was to be raised;  while in South Carolina it was made a penal offense to call a person a  \"Yankee\" or a \"nigger.\" Few of the Negro delegates demanded proscription  of whites or social equality; they wanted schools and the vote. The  white radicals were more anxious to keep the former Confederates from  holding office than from voting. The generals in command everywhere used  their influence to secure moderate action by the conventions, and for  this they were showered with abuse.    As provided by the reconstruction acts, the new constitutions were  submitted to the electorate created by those instruments. Unless a  majority of the registered voters in a State should take part in the  election, the reconstruction would fail and the State would remain under  military rule. The whites now inaugurated a more systematic policy of  abstention and in Alabama, on February 4, 1868, succeeded in holding  the total vote below a majority. Congress then rushed to the rescue of  radicalism with the act of the 11th of March, which provided that a  mere majority of those voting in the State was sufficient to inaugurate  reconstruction. Arkansas had followed the lead of Alabama, but too late;  in Mississippi the constitution was defeated by a majority vote; in  Texas the convention had made no provision for a vote; and in Virginia  the commanding general, disapproving of the work of the convention,  refused to pay the expenses of an election. In the other six States the  constitutions were adopted.*         * Except in Texas, the work of constitution making was       completed between November 5, 1867, and May 18, 1868.    These elections gave rise to more violent contests than before. They  also were double elections, as the voters cast ballots for state and  local officials and at the same time for or against the constitution.  The radical nominations were made by the Union League and the Freedmen's  Bureau, and nearly all radicals who had been members of conventions were  nominated and elected to office. The Negroes, expecting now to reap some  benefits of reconstruction, frequently brought sacks to the polls to  \"put the franchise in.\" The elections were all over by June 1868,  and the newly elected legislatures promptly ratified the Fourteenth  Amendment.    It now remained for Congress to approve the work done in the South  and to readmit the reorganized states. The case of Alabama gave some  trouble. Even Stevens, for a time, thought that this state should stay  out; but there was danger in delay. The success of the abstention  policy in Alabama and Arkansas and the reviving interest of the whites  foreshadowed white majorities in some places; the scalawags began  to forsake the radical party for the conservatives; and there were  Democratic gains in the North in 1867. Only six states, New York and  five New England States, allowed the Negro to vote, while four states,  Minnesota, Michigan, Kansas, and Ohio, voted down Negro suffrage after  the passage of the reconstruction acts. The ascendancy of the radicals  in Congress was menaced. The radicals needed the support of their  radical brethren in Southern States and they could not afford to wait  for the Fourteenth Amendment to become a part of the Constitution or  to tolerate other delay. On the 22d and the 25th of June, acts  were therefore passed admitting seven states, Alabama included, to  representation in Congress upon the \"fundamental condition\" that \"the  constitutions of neither of said States shall ever be so amended or  changed as to deprive any citizens or class of citizens of the United  States of the right to vote in said State, who are entitled to vote by  the constitution thereof herein recognized.\"    The generals now turned over the government to the recently  elected radical officials and retired into the background. Military  reconstruction was thus accomplished in all the States except Virginia,  Mississippi, and Texas.        CHAPTER VII. THE TRIAL OF PRESIDENT JOHNSON    While the radical program was being executed in the South, Congress  was engaged not only in supervising reconstruction but in subduing the  Supreme Court and in \"conquering\" President Johnson. One must admire the  efficiency of the radical machine. When the Southerners showed that they  preferred military rule as permitted by the Act of the 2nd of  March, Congress passed the Act of the 23d of March which forced the  reconstruction. When the President ventured to assert his power in  behalf of a considerate administration of the reconstruction acts,  Congress took the power out of his hands by the law of the 19th of July.  The Southern plan to defeat the new state constitutions by abstention  was no sooner made clear in the case of Alabama than Congress came to  the rescue with the Act of March 11, 1868.    Had it seemed necessary, Congress would have handled the Supreme Court  as it did the Southerners. The opponents of radical reconstruction were  anxious to get the reconstruction laws of March 1867, before the Court.  Chief Justice Chase was known to be opposed to military reconstruction,  and four other justices were, it was believed, doubtful of the  constitutionality of the laws. A series of conservative decisions gave  hope to those who looked to the Court for relief. The first decision, in  the case of ex parte Milligan, declared unconstitutional the trials of  civilians by military commissions when civil courts were open. A  few months later, in the cases of Cummings vs. Missouri and ex parte  Garland, the Court declared invalid, because ex post facto, the state  laws designed to punish former Confederates.    But the first attempts to get the reconstruction acts before the Supreme  Court failed. The State of Mississippi, in April 1867, brought suit to  restrain the President from executing the reconstruction acts. The Court  refused to interfere with the executive. A similar suit was then brought  against Secretary Stanton by Georgia with a like result. But in 1868,  in the case of ex parte McCardle, it appeared that the question of  the constitutionality of the reconstruction acts would be passed upon.  McCardle, a Mississippi editor arrested for opposition to reconstruction  and convicted by military commission, appealed to the Supreme Court,  which asserted its jurisdiction. But the radicals in alarm rushed  through Congress an act (March 27, 1868) which took away from the Court  its jurisdiction in cases arising under the reconstruction acts. The  highest court was thus silenced.    The attempt to remove the President from office was the only part of  the radical program that failed, and this by the narrowest of margins.  During the spring and summer of 1866, there was some talk among  politicians of impeaching President Johnson, and in December a  resolution was introduced by Representative Ashley of Ohio looking  toward impeachment. Though the committee charged with the investigation  of \"the official conduct of Andrew Johnson\" reported that enough  testimony had been taken to justify further inquiry, the House took no  action. There were no less than five attempts at impeachment during the  next year. Stevens, Butler, and others were anxious to get the President  out of the way, but the majority were as yet unwilling to impeach for  merely political reasons. There were some who thought that the radicals  had sufficient majorities to ensure all needed legislation and did not  relish the thought of Ben Wade in the presidency.* Others considered  that no just grounds for action had been found in the several  investigations of Johnson's record. Besides, the President's authority  and influence had been much curtailed by the legislation relating to the  Freedmen's Bureau, tenure of office, reconstruction, and command of  the army, and Congress had also refused to recognize his amnesty and  pardoning powers.         * Senator Wade of Ohio was President pro tempore of the       Senate and by the act of 1791 would succeed President       Johnson if he were removed from office.    But the desire to impeach the President was increasing in power, and  very little was needed to provoke a trial of strength between the  radicals and the President. The drift toward impeachment was due in  part to the legislative reaction against the executive, and in part  to Johnson's own opposition to reconstruction and to his use of the  patronage against the radicals. Specific grievances were found in  his vetoes of the various reconstruction bills, in his criticisms of  Congress and the radical leaders, and in the fact, as Stevens asserted,  that he was a \"radical renegade.\" Johnson was a Southern man, an  old-line State Rights Democrat, somewhat anti-Negro in feeling. He knew  no book except the Constitution, and that he loved with all his soul.  Sure of the correctness of his position, he was too stubborn to change  or to compromise. He was no more to be moved than Stevens or Sumner. To  overcome Johnson's vetoes required two-thirds of each House of Congress;  to impeach and remove him would require only a majority of the House and  two-thirds of the Senate.    The"]]]
