[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23860"],[0,"The Young Man's Guide (#20)"],[1,"     There are _two sorts_ of _busy_ men. One sort are busy, as the        result of _benevolent purpose_. These are often among the best of        mankind; and though always _busy_ in carrying out their plans,        they find time to perform a thousand little acts of goodness,        notwithstanding.--It has, indeed, been sometimes said, that when        a great public enterprise is about to be undertaken, which        requires the aid of individual contributions, either of time or        money, those who are most busy, and from whom we might naturally        expect the least, often do the _most_. It is also said that men        of business have the most leisure; and it sometimes seems to be        true, where they methodize their plans properly. These maxims,        however, apply with the most force to men devoted to a higher        purpose than the worship of this world--men who live for God,        and the good of his universe, generally.          There are also two sorts of _rich_ men. Some men may have        property in their hands to an immense amount, without possessing        a worldly spirit. The _rich_ man referred to above, is of another        sort. He is the man who '_gets all he can_, and _keeps_ all he        can _get_.' This is probably the gospel definition of the term,        a _rich man_, who, it is said, can no more enter a world of        spiritual enjoyment than a camel or a cable can go through 'the        eye of a needle.'      SECTION XII. _Of desiring the good opinion of others._    A young man is not far from ruin, when he can say, without blushing,  _I don't care what others think of me_. To be insensible to public  opinion, or to the estimation in which we are held by others, by no  means indicates a good and generous spirit.    But to have a due regard to public opinion is one thing, and to make  that opinion the principal rule of action, quite another. There is no  greater weakness than that of letting our happiness depend _too much_  upon the opinion of others. Other people lie under such disadvantages  for coming at our true characters, and are so often misled by prejudice  for or against us, that if our own conscience condemns us, their  approbation can give us little consolation. On the other hand, if we  are sure we acted from honest motives, and with a reference to proper  ends, it is of little consequence if the world should happen to find  fault. Mankind, for the most part, are so much governed by fancy, that  what will win their hearts to-day, will disgust them to-morrow; and he  who undertakes to please every body at all times, places, and  circumstances, will never be in want of employment.    A wise man, when he hears of reflections made upon him, will consider  whether they are _just_. If they are, he will correct the faults in  question, with as much cheerfulness as if they had been suggested by  his dearest friend.    I have sometimes thought that, in this view, enemies were the best of  friends. Those who are merely friends in name, are often unwilling to  tell us a great many things which it is of the highest importance that  we should know. But our enemies, from spite, envy, or some other cause,  mention them; and we ought on the whole to rejoice that they do, and to  make the most of their remarks.      SECTION XIII. _Intermeddling with the affairs of others._    There are some persons who never appear to be _happy_, if left to  themselves and their own reflections. All their enjoyment seems to come  from without; none from within. They are ever for having something to  do with the affairs of others. Not a single petty quarrel can take  place, in the neighborhood, but they suffer their feelings to be  enlisted, and allow themselves to \"take sides\" with one of the parties.  Those who possess such a disposition are among the most miserable of  their race.    An old writer says that 'Every one should mind his own business; for he  who is perpetually concerning himself about the good or ill fortune of  others, will never be at rest.' And he says truly.    It is not denied that some men are professionally bound to attend to  the concerns of others. But this is not the case supposed. The bulk of  mankind will be happier, and do more for others, by letting them alone;  at least by avoiding any of that sort of meddling which may be  construed into officiousness.    Some of the worst meddlers in human society are those who have been  denominated _match-makers_. A better name for them, however, would be  match-_breakers_, for if they do not actually break more matches than  they make, they usually cause a great deal of misery to those whom they  are instrumental in bringing prematurely together.    Many people who, in other respects, pass for excellent, do not hesitate  to take sides on almost all occasions, whether they know much about the  real merits of the case or not. Others judge, at once, of every one of  whom they hear any thing evil, and in the same premature manner.    All these and a thousand other kinds of 'meddling' do much evil. The  tendency is to keep men like Ishmael, with their hands against every  man, and every man's hands against theirs.      SECTION XIV. _On Keeping Secrets._    It is sometimes said that in a good state of society there would be no  necessity of _keeping_ secrets, for no individual would have any thing  to conceal. This _may_ be true; but if so, society is far--very  far--from being as perfect as it ought to be. At present we shall find  no intelligent circle, except it were the society of the glorified  above, which does not require occasional secrecy. But if there are  secrets to be kept, somebody must keep them.    Some persons can hardly conceal a secret, if they would. They will  promise readily enough; but the moment they gain possession of the  fact, its importance rises in their estimation, till it occupies so  much of their waking thoughts, that it will be almost certain, in some  form or other, to escape them.    Others are not very anxious to conceal things which are entrusted to  them. They may not wish to make mischief, exactly; but there is a sort  of recklessness about them, that renders them very unsafe confidants.    Others again, when they promise, mean to perform. But no sooner do they  possess the _treasure_ committed to their charge, than they begin to  grow forgetful of the _manner_ of coming by it. And before they are  aware, they reveal it.    There are not many then, whom it is safe to trust. These you will value  as they do diamonds, in proportion to their scarcity.    But there _are_ individuals who merit your highest confidence, if you  can but find them. Husbands, where a union is founded as it ought to  be, can usually trust their wives. This is one of the prominent  advantages of matrimony. It gives us an opportunity of unbosoming our  feelings and views and wishes not only with safety, but often with  _sympathy_.    But confidence may sometimes be reposed, in other circumstances. Too  much reserve makes us miserable. Perhaps it were better that we should  suffer a little, now and then, than that we should never trust.    As an instance of the extent to which mankind can sometimes be confided  in, and to show that celibacy, too, is not without this virtue, you  will allow me to relate, briefly, an anecdote.    A certain husband and wife had difficulties. They both sought advice of  a single gentleman, their family physician. For some time there was  hope of an amicable adjustment of all grievances; but at length every  effort proved vain, and an open quarrel ensued. But what was the  surprise of each party to learn by accident, some time afterward, that  both of them had sought counsel of the same individual, and yet he had  not betrayed the trust.    In a few instances, too, secrets have been confided to husbands,  without their communicating them to their wives; and the contrary. This  was done, however, by particular request. It is a requisition which,  for my own part, I should be very unwilling to make.      SECTION XV. _Fear of Poverty._    The ingenious but sometimes fanciful Dr. Darwin, reckons the fear of  poverty as a disease, and goes on to prescribe for it.    The truth is, there is not much _real_ poverty in this country. Our  very paupers are rich, for they usually have plenty of wholesome food,  and comfortable clothing, and what could a Croesus, with all _his_  riches, have more? Poverty exists much more in imagination than in  reality. The _shame of being thought poor_, is a great and fatal  weakness, to say the least. It depends, it is true, much upon the  fashion.    So long as the phrase 'he is a good man,' means that the person spoken  of is rich, we need not wonder that every one wishes to be thought  richer than he is. When adulation is sure to follow wealth, and when  contempt would be sure to follow many if they were not wealthy; when  people are spoken of with deference, and even lauded to the skies  because their riches are very great; when this is the case, I say, we  need not wonder if men are ashamed to be thought poor. But this is one  of the greatest dangers which young people have to encounter in setting  out in life. It has brought thousands and hundreds of thousands to  pecuniary ruin.    One of the most amiable features of _good_ republican society is this;  that men seldom boast of their riches, or disguise their poverty, but  speak of both, as of any other matters that are proper for  conversation. No man shuns another because he is poor; no man is  preferred to another because he is rich. In hundreds and hundreds of  instances have men in this country, not worth a shilling, been chosen  by the people to take care of their rights and interests, in preference  to men who ride in their carriages.    The shame of being thought poor leads to everlasting efforts to  _disguise_ one's poverty. The carriage--the domestics--the wine--the  spirits--the decanters--the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23875"],[0,"The Relief of Mafeking (#20)"],[1,"shooting back at the guns. Meanwhile the infantry was  threading out to the left, from which direction a shot now and then  sounded; and the remark of the onlookers (the onlooker is invariably a  critic) was, \"Why is he committing all his force to a left-flank turning  movement, leaving only a hundred and fifty men to watch his centre and  right, when there may be only a dozen men on that left kopje?\"    So said we, who sat on the gun limbers looking very wise; and, by one of  those unfortunate chances which sometimes justify the amateur critic and  encourage him in his vice, we turned out to be right. What was really  happening was this. The 150 or 400 Boers (I never discovered which,  although I believe it was the smaller number) who sat on that hill and  saw us coming did not wish to stay. So they held the middle kopje, and  threw out what is called a \"false flank\" on to the left kopje; and then,  seeing our whole force committed to the left, they went behind the hill  and filled their pipes, and packed their saddlebags and rode off,  leaving the six men to keep us busy while they went. And then the six  men departed also; and after much careful scouting, we rode victoriously  over the kopje. If we had attacked on the right flank also, we should  probably have caught them, as Lord Chesham would in a little longer have  got round to their rear and cut them off. Of course, the whole  difficulty in such cases arises from the invisible fire of smokeless  powder. One never knows whether the banging is produced by six men  firing briskly or by sixty firing slowly, and that was why Lord Chesham  had to tire out his horses by taking them round twelve miles to avoid  six men.    Our only \"casualty\" was carried out of action in a stretcher--he was a  member of the volunteer company of the Northamptons.    \"They've got me, sir,\" he said to me, in tones of mingled pride and  martyrdom, \"'it in the leg.\"    As a matter of fact, the man was only scratched; he could easily walk,  but could not resist the circumstance of the stretcher; and he fell into  his place for the rest of the march, a very proud man.    We bivouacked at Granaatz Plaatz farm that night, whence the heliograph  winked the news of our engagement to our camp. It was a day of alternate  sunshine and cloud, and the messages gave the signallers much trouble. I  had one to send after the official messages, and the sun was getting low  by the time it began. The shine never lasted for more than twenty  seconds, but they managed to edge the words into the blinks until they  came to \"Zwaartzkopjesfontein.\" The sun always gave out in the middle of  it; the regulations demanded that the word should be begun afresh every  time, and finally the sun sank victoriously on the fell word. Darkness  set in, and a blinding thunderstorm with deluges of rain, but the  signallers were not to be beaten.    \"We'll do ut on the lamp, sorr, and divil take the ould sun for goin'  out on us,\" said the Irish sergeant.    I should not like to say how many people had to do with that message  before it got near the cable. In the first place, the light could hardly  penetrate the twelve-mile space of rain; and even when they had  succeeded in \"calling up\" headquarters the lightning flashes interfered  with our feeble dots and dashes. I shall always remember that little  group of men working most admirably on the kopje high up amid the storm  and rain--one lying on his face in the mud with a telescope propped on a  stone reading the reply; another keeping the paper dry under his helmet  while he spelt the message to the operator; and a third working the  shutter that, by occulting the light, makes flashes from the lamp.    \"_Guardian_--G-u-a-r-d-i-a-n,\" says the reader.    \"Bang, bang; rattle; bang, rattle, rattle; bang; bang, bang, rattle;  bang, rattle; bang, rattle, rattle; bang, bang, bang,\" goes the lamp.    An anxious pause is enlivened by a clap of thunder.    \"Answered,\" says Spy-glass. And often a word had to be repeated three or  four times before it was answered, but at the fourth letter of  \"Zwaartzkopjesfontein\" the answering signal was plainly given, followed  by DDDD, which, although not in the code-book, is an expression well  understood by all signallers.    All that night it rained, and the men in their wretched bivouacs sang  through it all with a most admirable heroism. Imagine yourself with two  other people lying in three inches of water with two blankets supported  by rifles over your head, and you have their condition. And they started  again in the cold, rainy darkness, wet and chilled to the bone, still  singing. But that is the private soldier all over. Put him in really  happy circumstances, and he grumbles himself hoarse; give him something  really to grumble at, and he is cheerful; give him misery, and he sings.  We marched fifteen miles on Thursday, the 12th, and encamped at  Buitendam, the farm of a field-cornet, where a few of the enemy sniped  at us as we arrived and had the satisfaction of seeing the whole force  turned out after a weary march. But of course the Boers are in their  element at this kind of game. A hundred of them wish to drive away some  stock; they leave a dozen to snipe from a ridge, while we send Tommy  plodding round for miles on a flanking movement (for you must keep him  out of range); and when the cattle have been driven far enough away,  Mr. Boer jumps on his horse and is off also, while we ruefully \"occupy\"  the vacant hill.    We found a noisy and rather gratifying revenge in destroying some  ammunition which was buried in the garden; the throwing of three  thousand rounds of cordite ammunition into the fire is a peculiarly  exciting game. Some presiding genius, instead of blowing up the two  cases of dynamite, threw them into the dam, whence, I have been told,  they were fished up, not a penny the worse, by the Boers after our  departure next day.    A thing happened in connection with this Boer ammunition which shows  once more how very easy it is to attribute all kinds of sins to one's  enemy. Someone came running up to a little group of us with several  packets of cartridges, one with the seal broken.    \"Here's a pretty thing,\" he said; \"poisoned bullets--the brutes!\"    Sure enough, there were the steel bullets projecting out of the  cartridges, each completely coated with something very like verdigris up  to the edge of the brass envelope. The sealed packets showed that they  must have been so received from the makers, which easily proved the  most premeditated barbarity. Exclamations were rife; a brigadier was  making notes in his pocket-book; someone was urging a correspondent to  send home a cable announcing the fact, when a man, who had been sitting  quietly through it all, said--    \"That's all very well, but how about the rifling in the barrel? I guess  there wouldn't be much of that stuff left on by the time the bullet was  spinning.\"    Silence fell like a cloud on the group, and the bubble was finally  pricked when another officer came up and said--    \"More bad grease! I've had to chuck out half a box of ammunition because  the grease has gone bad and fouls the rifles.\"    Of course; it was as simple as day. The bullets had, as usual, been  dipped in grease to preserve them, and the grease had gone bad. When I  returned to the little circle there was an animated conversation in  progress on the subject of visiting patrols.    We marched in next day, eighteen miles, having covered a pear-shaped  track eastwards of about forty miles, while the men behaved like Trojans  under most uncomfortable circumstances.    We remained for some days in camp, waiting for Lord Roberts to move, and  fighting no more dangerous enemy than the wet and boisterous weather of  young winter. Certainly Lord Methuen had a fine force there, well tried  and in excellent condition, and we all hoped that he might be given a  chance to do something with it. There is something at once lonely and  lofty in the position of a General Officer in the field that wins one's  sympathy. You see it most plainly at a full church parade such as was  held on Easter Sunday, when the whole force was formed into a hollow  square. Walls of living faces; before them, a few paces, company  officers; before them again, commanding officers; the chaplain in the  middle; and then the pleasant-looking Guardsman striding into his place  in front of all and saluting the chaplain--the only person to whom that  honour is rendered. After the short service the General's position is  still more sharply indicated, when the shouting of orders takes the  place of the parson's placid tones.    \"Northamptons! _'shon_! Fours left, by the left--quick--_march_!\" and  the tramp of feet nears the spot where the General stands alone. Down  the whole battalion you hear the order run, \"Company! eyes _left_!\" and  hundreds of eyes are turned on the General, until the (to him) welcome  \"Eyes _front_!\" relieves him from so particular a scrutiny. Is it not a  paragon of what he has to endure from the world?          XVI    A SURPRISE ON THE MARCH      Strangely enough, I had just written the last chapter, describing the  profound peace of our environments, when from my tent near the farmhouse  I saw one after another of the headquarters staff mount their horses and  gallop westwards up the hill after Lord Methuen, who was easily first.  One learns to read signs quickly in a military camp, and it did not  require much intuition to understand that something was, in the phrase  of the orderly at the vacant headquarters, \"bloomin' well hup.\" My own  horse was ready in five minutes, and when I reached the top of the hill  I found the cavalry horse lines vacant.    The site of the Zwaartzkopjesfontein camp turns an abrupt face  eastwards, but on the westward side the plateau slopes almost  imperceptibly to the plain, which is, in its immediate neighbourhood,  thickly sown with kopjes."]]]
