I understood the  situation at a glance; the bird was afraid to come forth and brave the  anger of the male. Not till I had rapped smartly upon the limb with my  stick did she come out and attempt to escape; but she had not gone ten  feet from the tree before the male was in hot pursuit, and in a few  moments had driven her back to the same tree, where she tried to avoid  him among the branches. There is probably no gallantry among the birds  except at the mating season. I have frequently seen the male woodpecker  drive the female away from the bone upon the tree. When she hopped  around to the other end and timidly nibbled it, he would presently dart  spitefully at her. She would then take up her position in his rear and  wait till he had finished his meal. The position of the female among the  birds is very much the same as that of women among savage tribes. Most  of the drudgery of life falls upon her, and the leavings of the males  are often her lot.    [Illustration: DOWNY WOODPECKER]    My bird is a genuine little savage, doubtless, but I value him as a  neighbor. It is a satisfaction during the cold or stormy winter nights  to know he is warm and cozy there in his retreat. When the day is bad  and unfit to be abroad in, he is there too. When I wish to know if he is  at home, I go and rap upon his tree, and, if he is not too lazy or  indifferent, after some delay he shows his head in his round doorway  about ten feet above, and looks down inquiringly upon me--sometimes  latterly I think half resentfully, as much as to say, \"I would thank you  not to disturb me so often.\" After sundown, he will not put his head out  any more when I call, but as I step away I can get a glimpse of him  inside looking cold and reserved. He is a late riser, especially if it  is a cold or disagreeable morning, in this respect being like the barn  fowls; it is sometimes near nine o'clock before I see him leave his  tree. On the other hand, he comes home early, being in, if the day is  unpleasant, by four P.M. He lives all alone; in this respect I do not  commend his example. Where his mate is, I should like to know.    I have discovered several other woodpeckers in adjoining orchards, each  of which has a like home, and leads a like solitary life. One of them  has excavated a dry limb within easy reach of my hand, doing the work  also in September. But the choice of tree was not a good one; the limb  was too much decayed, and the workman had made the cavity too large; a  chip had come out, making a hole in the outer wall. Then he went a few  inches down the limb and began again, and excavated a large, commodious  chamber, but had again come too near the surface; scarcely more than the  bark protected him in one place, and the limb was very much weakened.  Then he made another attempt still farther down the limb, and drilled in  an inch or two, but seemed to change his mind; the work stopped, and I  concluded the bird had wisely abandoned the tree. Passing there one  cold, rainy November day, I thrust in my two fingers and was surprised  to feel something soft and warm: as I drew away my hand the bird came  out, apparently no more surprised than I was. It had decided, then, to  make its home in the old limb; a decision it had occasion to regret, for  not long after, on a stormy night, the branch gave way and fell to the  ground:--        \"When the bough breaks the cradle will fall,      And down will come baby and cradle and all.\"    Another trait our woodpeckers have that endears them to me is their  habit of drumming in the spring. They are songless birds, and yet all  are musicians; they make the dry limbs eloquent of the coming change.  Did you think that loud, sonorous hammering which proceeded from the  orchard or from the near woods on that still March or April morning was  only some bird getting its breakfast? It is Downy, but he is not rapping  at the door of a grub; he is rapping at the door of spring, and the dry  limb thrills beneath the ardor of his blows.    A few seasons ago, a downy woodpecker, probably the individual one who  is now my winter neighbor, began to drum early in March in a partly  decayed apple-tree that stands in the edge of a narrow strip of woodland  near me. When the morning was still and mild I would often hear him  through my window before I was up, or by half-past six o'clock, and he  would keep it up pretty briskly till nine or ten o'clock, in this  respect resembling the grouse, which do most of their drumming in the  forenoon. His drum was the stub of a dry limb about the size of one's  wrist. The heart was decayed and gone, but the outer shell was hard and  resonant. The bird would keep his position there for an hour at a time.  Between his drummings he would preen his plumage and listen as if for  the response of the female, or for the drum of some rival. How swiftly  his head would go when he was delivering his blows upon the limb! His  beak wore the surface perceptibly. When he wished to change the key,  which was quite often, he would shift his position an inch or two to a  knot which gave out a higher, shriller note. When I climbed up to  examine his drum, he was much disturbed. I did not know he was in the  vicinity, but it seems he saw me from a near tree, and came in haste to  the neighboring branches, and with spread plumage and a sharp note  demanded plainly enough what my business was with his drum. I was  invading his privacy, desecrating his shrine, and the bird was much put  out. After some weeks the female appeared; he had literally drummed up a  mate; his urgent and oft-repeated advertisement was answered. Still the  drumming did not cease, but was quite as fervent as before. If a mate  could be won by drumming, she could be kept and entertained by more  drumming; courtship should not end with marriage. If the bird felt  musical before, of course he felt much more so now. Besides that, the  gentle deities needed propitiating in behalf of the nest and young as  well as in behalf of the mate. After a time a second female came, when  there was war between the two. I did not see them come to blows, but I  saw one female pursuing the other about the place, and giving her no  rest for several days. She was evidently trying to run her out of the  neighborhood. Now and then, she, too, would drum briefly, as if sending  a triumphant message to her mate.    The woodpeckers do not each have a particular dry limb to which they  resort at all times to drum, like the one I have described. The woods  are full of suitable branches, and they drum more or less here and there  as they are in quest of food; yet I am convinced each one has its  favorite spot, like the grouse, to which it resorts especially in the  morning. The sugar-maker in the maple woods may notice that this sound  proceeds from the same tree or trees about his camp with great  regularity. A woodpecker in my vicinity has drummed for two seasons on a  telegraph-pole, and he makes the wires and glass insulators ring.  Another drums on a thin board on the end of a long grape-arbor, and on  still mornings can be heard a long distance.           *       *       *       *       *    I watch these woodpeckers daily to see if I can solve the mystery as to  how they hop up and down the trunks and branches without falling away  from them when they let go their hold. They come down a limb or trunk  backward by a series of little hops, moving both feet together. If the  limb is at an angle to the tree and they are on the under side of it,  they do not fall away from it to get a new hold an inch or half-inch  farther down. They are held to it as steel to a magnet. Both tail and  head are involved in the feat. At the instant of making the hop the head  is thrown in and the tail thrown out, but the exact mechanics of it I  cannot penetrate. Philosophers do not yet know how a backward-falling  cat turns in the air, but turn she does. It may be that the woodpecker  never quite relaxes his hold, though to my eye he appears to do so.      THE DOWNY WOODPECKER        Downy came and dwelt with me,        Taught me hermit lore;      Drilled his cell in oaken tree        Near my cabin door.        Architect of his own home        In the forest dim,      Carving its inverted dome        In a dozy limb.        Carved it deep and shaped it true        With his little bill;      Took no thought about the view,        Whether dale or hill.        Shook the chips upon the ground,        Careless who might see.      Hark! his hatchet's muffled sound        Hewing in the tree.        Round his door as compass-mark,        True and smooth his wall;      Just a shadow on the bark        Points you to his hall.        Downy leads a hermit life        All the winter through;      Free his days from jar and strife,        And his cares are few.        Waking up the frozen woods,        Shaking down the snows;      Many trees of many moods        Echo to his blows.        When the storms of winter rage,        Be it night or day,      Then I know my little page        Sleeps the time away.        Downy's stores are in the trees,        Egg and ant and grub;      Juicy tidbits, rich as cheese,        Hid in stump and stub.        Rat-tat-tat his chisel goes,        Cutting out his prey;      Every boring insect knows        When he comes its way.        Always rapping at their doors,        Never welcome he;      All his kind, they vote, are bores,        Whom they dread to see.        Why does Downy live alone        In his snug retreat?      Has he found that near the bone        Is the sweetest meat?        Birdie craved another fate        When the spring had come;      Advertised him for a mate        On his dry-limb drum.        Drummed her up and drew her near,        In the April morn,      Till she owned him for her dear        In his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26059"],[0,"The Ascent of Denali (Mount McKinley) (#20)"],[1,"and two calves sprang up from the brush, our approach over the moss not  giving enough notice to awake her from sleep until we were almost upon  her.    [Illustration: \"Muk,\" the author's pet malamute.]    [Sidenote: The Boat]    Instead of pursuing our way across the increasingly difficult and swampy  country to the place where our boat and supplies lay cached, we turned  aside at midday to the \"fish camp\" on the Bearpaw, and, after enjoying  the best our host possessed from the stream and from his early garden,  borrowed his boat, choosing twenty miles or so on the water to nine of  niggerhead and marsh. But the river was very low and we had much trouble  getting the boat over riffles and bars, so that it was late at night  when we reached that other habitation of dragons known as Diamond City.  While we submerged our cached poling boat to swell its sun-dried seams,  Walter and Johnny returned the borrowed boat, and, since the stream had  fallen yet more, were many hours in reaching the fish camp and in  tramping back.    [Sidenote: The Beaver and the Indians]    But the labor of the return journey was now done. A canvas stretched  over willows made a shelter for the centre of the boat, and at noon on  the second day men, dogs, and baggage were embarked, to float down the  Bearpaw to the Kantishna, to the Tanana, to the Yukon. The Bearpaw  swarmed with animal life. Geese and ducks, with their little terrified  broods, scooted ahead of us on the water, the mothers presently leaving  their young in a nook of the bank and making a flying detour to return  to them. Sometimes a duck would simulate a broken wing to lure us away  from the little ones. We had no meat and were hungry for the usual early  summer diet of water-fowl, but not hungry enough to kill these birds.  Beaver dropped noisily into the water from trees that exhibited their  marvellous carpentry, some lying prostrate, some half chiselled through.  It seemed, indeed, as though the beaver were preparing great irrigation  works all through this country. Since the law went into effect  prohibiting their capture until 1915 they have increased and multiplied  all over interior Alaska. They are still caught by the natives, but  since their skins cannot be sold the Indians are wearing beaver garments  again to the great advantage of health in the severe winters. One wishes  very heartily that the prohibition might be made perpetual, for only so  will fur become the native wear again. It is good to see the children,  particularly, in beaver coats and breeches instead of the wretched  cotton that otherwise is almost their only garb. Would it be altogether  beyond reason to hope that a measure which was enacted to prevent the  extermination of an animal might be perpetuated on behalf of the  survival of an interesting and deserving race of human beings now sorely  threatened? Or is it solely the conservation of commercial resources  that engages the attention of government? There are few measures that  would redound more to the physical benefit of the Alaskan Indian than  the perpetuating of the law against the sale of beaver skins. With the  present high and continually appreciating price of skins, none of the  common people of the land, white or native, can afford to wear furs.  Such a prohibition as has been suggested would restore to Alaskans a  small share in the resources of Alaska. Is there any country in the  world where furs are actually needed more?    Not only beaver, but nearly all fur and game animals have greatly  increased in the Kantishna country. In the year of the stampede, when  thousands of men spent the winter here, there was wholesale destruction  of game and trapping of fur. But the country, left to itself, is now  restocked of game and fur, except of foxes, the high price of which has  almost exterminated them here and is rapidly exterminating them  throughout interior Alaska. They have been poisoned in the most reckless  and unscrupulous way, and there seems no means of stopping it under the  present law. We saw scarcely a fox track in the country, though a few  years ago they were exceedingly plentiful all over the foot-hills of the  great range. Mink, marten, and muskrat were seen from time to time  swimming in the river; a couple of yearling moose started from the bank  where they had been drinking as we noiselessly turned a bend; brilliant  kingfishers flitted across the water. So down these rivers we drifted,  sometimes in sunshine, sometimes in rain, until early in the morning of  the 20th June, we reached Tanana, and our journey was concluded three  months and four days after it was begun. When the telegraph office  opened at 8 o'clock a message was sent, in accordance with promise, to a  Seattle paper, and it illustrates the rapidity with which news is spread  to-day that a ship in Bering Sea, approaching Nome, received the news  from Seattle by wireless telegraph before 11 A. M. But a message from  the Seattle paper received the same morning asking for \"five hundred  more words describing narrow escapes\" was left unanswered, for, thank  God, there were none to describe.

CHAPTER VII    THE HEIGHT OF DENALI, WITH A DISCUSSION OF THE READINGS ON THE SUMMIT  AND DURING THE ASCENT      The determination of the heights of mountains by triangulation is, of  course, the method that in general commends itself to the topographer,  though it may be questioned whether the very general use of aneroids for  barometric determinations has not thrown this latter means of measuring  altitudes into undeserved discredit when the mercurial barometer is used  instead of its convenient but unreliable substitute.    The altitude given on the present maps for Denali is the mean of  determinations made by triangulation by three different men: Muldrow on  the Sushitna[7] side in 1898, Raeburn on the Kuskokwim side in 1902, and  Porter, from the Yentna country in 1906. In addition, a determination  was made by the Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1910, from points near  Cook's Inlet. \"The work of the Coast Survey,\" writes Mr. Alfred Brooks,  \"is more refined than the rough triangulation done by our men; at the  same time they were much further away.\" \"It is a curious coincidence,\"  he adds, \"that the determination made by the Coast Survey was the mean  which we had assumed from our three determinations\" (twenty thousand  three hundred feet).    [Sidenote: Theodolites and Barometers]    There are, however, two sources of error in the determination of the  height of this mountain by triangulation--a general one and a particular  one. The general one lies in the difficulty of ascertaining the proper  correction to be applied for the refraction of the atmosphere, and the  higher the mountain the greater the liability to this error; for not  much is positively known about the angle of refraction of the upper  regions of the air. The officers of the Trigonometrical Survey of India  have published their opinion that the heights of the great peaks of the  Himalayas will have to be revised on this account. The report of the  Coast Survey's determination of the height of Denali claims a  \"co-efficient of refraction nearer the truth\" than the figure used on a  previous occasion; but a very slight difference in this factor will make  a considerable difference in the result.    The particular source of error in the case of this mountain lies in the  circumstance that its summit is flat, and there is no culminating point  upon which the cross-hairs of the surveying instrument may intersect.    The barometric determination of heights is, of course, not without  similar troubles of its own. The tables of altitudes corresponding to  pressures do not agree, Airy's table giving relatively greater altitudes  for very low pressures than the Smithsonian. All such tables as  originally calculated are based upon the hypothesis of a temperature and  humidity which decrease regularly with the altitude, and this is not  always the case; nor is the \"static equilibrium of the atmosphere\" which  Laplace assumed always maintained; that is to say an equal difference of  pressure does not always correspond to an equal difference of altitude.  There is, in point of fact, no absolute way to determine altitude save  by running an actual line of levels; all other methods are  approximations at best. But there had never been a barometric  determination of the height of this mountain made, and it was resolved  to attempt it on this expedition.    To this end careful arrangements were made and much labor and trouble  undergone. The author carried his standard mercurial mountain barometer  to Fort Gibbon on the Yukon in September, 1912, and compared it with the  instrument belonging to the Signal Corps of the United States army at  that post. A very close agreement was found in the two instruments; the  reading of the one, by himself, and of the other, by the sergeant whose  regular duty it was to read and record the instrument, being identical  to two places of decimals at the same temperature.    [Sidenote: Readings on the Summit]    Arrangements were made with Captain Michel of the Signal Corps at Fort  Gibbon, when the expedition started to the mountain in March, 1913, to  read the barometer at that post three times a day and record the reading  with the reading of the attached thermometer. Acknowledgment is here  made of Captain Michel's courtesy and kindness in this essential  co-operation. The reading at Fort Gibbon which most nearly synchronizes  with the reading on top of the mountain is the one taken at noon on the  7th June. The reading on top of the mountain was made at about 1.50  P. M., so that there was an hour and fifty minutes difference in time.  The weather, however, was set fair, without a cloud in the sky, and had  been for more "]]]
