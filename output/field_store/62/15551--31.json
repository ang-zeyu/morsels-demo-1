The whole stupendous  structure--the cross of which, lifting itself literally to the blue  skies, can be seen over the hills from the sea--occupied 116 years in  building, and was continued during the reigns of eighteen popes. Leo X.  was one of these, and his scheme of raising money for the work by the  sale of indulgences, went far to produce the Reformation. Truly God's  ways are wonderful, the almost trifling acts of a single person often  bringing about the most mighty results and changes in the world!    \"St. Peter's is less like a church than a collection of large churches  enclosed under one gigantic roof.... One is lost in it. It is a city of  columns, sculptures, and mosaics.\" So says the clever, versatile Willis,  in his \"Pencillings by the Way,\" and it would certainly take months to  examine minutely all that is worthy of attention in this vast pile. Our  time, unfortunately, was limited, and we were only able to notice some  of the more celebrated and striking features. Of the plan of the  building, and its architecture, external and internal, I will say  nothing, for what can now be said that has not been said before, and far  better than I could say it? Almost every one nowadays has formed his own  idea of what this great church is like--of its exceeding vastness and  extent, the immensity of its over-arching dome, and its gorgeous and  profuse decorations. Yet when they at length come to visit this  preconceived and idealized vision, perhaps their feeling is almost one  of vague disappointment. Like Hilda in the \"Marble Faun,\" we at first  prefer our own dream-edifice to the solid reality. It is, in fact, so  immense that you utterly fail to take it in all at once; your gaze is  arrested by ponderous columns and you must be content to see it in  fragments. You yourself seem so lost in its immensity, that you find it  impossible to take in its immeasurable vastness from any single  standpoint, the mind utterly refusing to grasp it; but on a second and  third visit, you gradually obtain a more comprehensive idea of its  proportions.                                \"Thy mind,       Expanded by the genius of the spot,       Has grown colossal....        \"Thou movest, but increasing with the advance,       Like climbing some great Alp, which still doth rise,       Deceived by its gigantic elegance;       Vastness which grows, but grows to harmonize,       All musical in its immensities:       Rich marbles, richer painting, shrines where flame       The lamps of gold, and haughty dome which vies       In air with earth's chief structures, though the frame       Sits on the firm-set ground--and this the clouds must claim.        \"Thou seest not all; but piecemeal thou must break,       To separate contemplation, the great whole:       And as the ocean many bays will make,       That ask the eye--so here condense the soul       To more immediate objects, and control         Thy thoughts until thy mind hath got by heart       Its eloquent proportions, and unroll       In mighty graduations, part by part,       The glory, which at once upon thee did not dart.        \"Not by its fault, but thine: our outward sense       Is but of gradual grasp--and as it is       That what we have of feeling most intense       Outstrips our faint expression; even so this       Outshining and o'erwhelming edifice       Fools our fond gaze, and, greatest of the great,       Defies at first our nature's littleness,       Till, growing with its growth, we thus dilate       Our spirits to the size of that they contemplate.\"    Mendelssohn says, \"You strive to distinguish the ceiling as little as  the canopy of heaven: you lose your way in St. Peter's; you take a walk  in it, and ramble till you are quite tired. When Divine Service is  performed and chanted there, you are not aware of it till you are quite  close.... When the music commences, the sounds do not reach you for a  long time, but echo and float in the vast space so that the most  singular and vague harmonies are borne toward you.\"    The interior space is the more increased by the fact of there being no  seats of any kind, and seems so immense that things of colossal size  appear of only ordinary proportions. Thus, two apparently small cherubs,  holding a vessel of holy water, are in reality six feet high; and other  figures, almost insignificant in the distance, are really wonderfully  large. The pen in the hand of St. Mark on the dome is five feet long.    There are about 134 popes buried here, and when looking at their grand  and beautiful monuments, extending up the left aisle, one cannot but  remember that these were the men whose power was at times almost  unlimited, who controlled the destinies of the world, and made emperors  tremble; and the mind travels back into the dark ages of the past. But  in these enlightened times, when the souls of men have shaken off the  fetters of mediaeval bondage, it is difficult to understand how our  ancestors could have been so enslaved--worshipping the reigning pope,  though even a Borgia, as a very God upon earth. Near the last column of  the aisle is a colossal bronze statue of St. Peter, seated on a huge  chair or throne. We noticed that every one (Roman Catholic) bowed before  the image, and afterwards advanced and kissed one of the feet, the big  toe of which is quite worn away with the friction of countless myriads  of devout lips, and the general wiping of the sacred digit by each  individual before venturing to kiss it. It would seem, alas! that the  present generation is not so very far removed from the superstitions and  absurdities of the past, after all!    In the Pieta Chapel is one of the most beautiful pieces of sculpture I  have ever seen; it is Michael Angelo's _Dead Christ_. The Saviour's head  rests on the knee of the Virgin Mother, whose face is full of the  deepest pathos of holy love and intense sorrow. Truly a God-inspired  work.        \"Art is the gift of God, and must be used       Unto His glory. That in art is highest       Which aims at this.\"    How appropriate these words are, placed in the mouth of the great  Buonaroti, we could hardly imagine till we had seen this sublime work  of art.    We felt greatly interested, in common with all our countrymen, in the  tomb which contains the ashes of the last of the Stuarts. Canova's  winged genii stand with reversed torches on either side of the door,  which is now closed for ever.    I must confess that I was neither pleased nor edified by the services  conducted in the gorgeous side chapels; they certainly seemed but a  mechanical form of prayer, little less than sacrilegious; the bishops,  priests, and choir hastening to get through the formula--those who were  not yawning taking snuff. Indeed, there was a dreadful absence of real  Christian humility and reverence. One day we arrived in time to witness  a High Church ceremonial--it was the anniversary of St. Peter. Cardinal  Howard officiated instead of the Pope, who had one of his frequent fits  of the sulks towards Italy. He was supported by all the great  dignitaries and potentates of the Romish Church, \"a grotesque company of  old womanish old men in gaudy gowns.\" The cardinal is a robust  Englishman of the Friar Tuck style--the very antithesis to the  spiritual, thoughtful, Newman type. He is, however, zealous in his  duties, and much liked by the people. The principal part of the ceremony  seemed to consist in the constant changing of the cardinal's gorgeous  robes, accompanied by procession and prayer; and finally, when he left,  the people, more especially the women, rushed to kiss his hand. In spite  of its incongruity in our eyes, it was rather a touching sight, and the  cardinal seemed to realize almost painfully, as we did, the adoration of  the poorer of his flock.    The music was instrumental and vocal, the former composed entirely of  stringed instruments, and we were not at all inspired by it. It was not  to be compared to the fine choirs of St Paul's, the Temple, or,  Westminster Abbey; and for sacred music I think there is nothing like  the grand, melodious swell of the organ. We found none of the grand  Masses or other ceremonies of the Roman Church at St. Peter's, which  could compare for a moment in reverential feeling with the solemn  impressiveness of our own large churches during our beautiful and  eloquent service, which is so full of deep and earnest feeling, and yet  withal so simple that all can understand; and what more sublime than to  hear a vast congregation singing, as with a single voice, one of our  fine old hymns, such as the imperishable and soul-inspiring \"Rock of  Ages\"? Yet even here I think there is sometimes too much of a secular  character now introduced into church music.    The more one sees of St. Peter's the less easy it is to realize that so  magnificent and wonderful an edifice has been constructed by man.  Compare the stupendous structure with the puny attempts of the present  day. Architecture seems almost a lost art. I think this is owing to  want of patience; the lack of doing all things thoroughly and well; the  preference for mere show rather than durability and beauty; and the  selfish gratification of our own generation rather than a patriotic  pride and thought for future ages. If the nineteenth century has made  great advances in the industries, science, and thought, it has also  introduced a taste for meretricious imitation in every department of  manufacture and art. This is essentially the century for contracts.  Everything is done by contract, and not only is the matter of cost, but  also that of time, made a strong point in the bargain. When St. Peter's  was built, estimates of cost were not thought of, and no one ever  dreamed of fixing a date for completion of so vast a work.

Ye well-known mountain summits high,  Ye groves whose depths I know so well,  Thou beauteous sky above, farewell!  Delicious nature, thee I fly,  The calm existence which I prize  I yield for splendid vanities,  Thou too farewell, my liberty!  Whither and wherefore do I speed  And what will Destiny concede?\"    XXVII    Farther Tattiana's walks extend--  'Tis now the hillock now the rill  Their natural attractions lend  To stay the maid against her will.  She the acquaintances she loves,  Her spacious fields and shady groves,  Another visit hastes to pay.  But Summer swiftly fades away  And golden Autumn draweth nigh,  And pallid nature trembling grieves,  A victim decked with golden leaves;  Dark clouds before the north wind fly;  It blew: it howled: till winter e'en  Came forth in all her magic sheen.    XXVIII    The snow descends and buries all,  Hangs heavy on the oaken boughs,  A white and undulating pall  O'er hillock and o'er meadow throws.  The channel of the river stilled  As if with eider-down is filled.  The hoar-frost glitters: all rejoice  In mother Winter's strange caprice.  But Tania's heart is not at ease,  Winter's approach she doth not hail  Nor the frost particles inhale  Nor the first snow of winter seize  Her shoulders, breast and face to lave--  Alarm the winter journey gave.    XXIX    The date was fixed though oft postponed,  But ultimately doth approach.  Examined, mended, newly found  Was the old and forgotten coach;  Kibitkas three, the accustomed train,(71)  The household property contain:  Saucepans and mattresses and chairs,  Portmanteaus and preserves in jars,  Feather-beds, also poultry-coops,  Basins and jugs--well! everything  To happiness contributing.  Behold! beside their dwelling groups  Of serfs the farewell wail have given.  Nags eighteen to the door are driven.    [Note 71: In former times, and to some extent the practice still  continues to the present day, Russian families were wont to  travel with every necessary of life, and, in the case of the  wealthy, all its luxuries following in their train. As the  poet complains in a subsequent stanza there were no inns;  and if the simple Larinas required such ample store of creature  comforts the impediments accompanying a great noble on his  journeys may be easily conceived.]    XXX    These to the coach of state are bound,  Breakfast the busy cooks prepare,  Baggage is heaped up in a mound,  Old women at the coachmen swear.  A bearded postillion astride  A lean and shaggy nag doth ride,  Unto the gates the servants fly  To bid the gentlefolk good-bye.  These take their seats; the coach of state  Leisurely through the gateway glides.  \"Adieu! thou home where peace abides,  Where turmoil cannot penetrate,  Shall I behold thee once again?\"--  Tattiana tears cannot restrain.    XXXI    The limits of enlightenment  When to enlarge we shall succeed,  In course of time (the whole extent  Will not five centuries exceed  By computation) it is like  Our roads transformed the eye will strike;  Highways all Russia will unite  And form a network left and right;  On iron bridges we shall gaze  Which o'er the waters boldly leap,  Mountains we'll level and through deep  Streams excavate subaqueous ways,  And Christian folk will, I expect,  An inn at every stage erect.    XXXII    But now, what wretched roads one sees,  Our bridges long neglected rot,  And at the stages bugs and fleas  One moment's slumber suffer not.  Inns there are none. Pretentious but  Meagre, within a draughty hut,  A bill of fare hangs full in sight  And irritates the appetite.  Meantime a Cyclops of those parts  Before a fire which feebly glows  Mends with the Russian hammer's blows  The flimsy wares of Western marts,  With blessings on the ditches and  The ruts of his own fatherland.    XXXIII    Yet on a frosty winter day  The journey in a sledge doth please,  No senseless fashionable lay  Glides with a more luxurious ease;  For our Automedons are fire  And our swift troikas never tire;  The verst posts catch the vacant eye  And like a palisade flit by.(72)  The Larinas unwisely went,  From apprehension of the cost,  By their own horses, not the post--  So Tania to her heart's content  Could taste the pleasures of the road.  Seven days and nights the travellers plod.    [Note 72: This somewhat musty joke has appeared in more than one  national costume. Most Englishmen, if we were to replace  verst-posts with milestones and substitute a graveyard for  a palisade, would instantly recognize its Yankee extraction.  In Russia however its origin is as ancient at least as the  reign of Catherine the Second. The witticism ran thus: A  courier sent by Prince Potemkin to the Empress drove so  fast that his sword, projecting from the vehicle, rattled  against the verst-posts as if against a palisade!]    XXXIV    But they draw near. Before them, lo!  White Moscow raises her old spires,  Whose countless golden crosses glow  As with innumerable fires.(73)  Ah! brethren, what was my delight  When I yon semicircle bright  Of churches, gardens, belfries high  Descried before me suddenly!  Moscow, how oft in evil days,  Condemned to exile dire by fate,  On thee I used to meditate!  Moscow! How much is in the phrase  For every loyal Russian breast!  How much is in that word expressed!    [Note 73: The aspect of Moscow, especially as seen from the Sparrow  Hills, a low range bordering the river Moskva at a short distance  from the city, is unique and splendid. It possesses several domes  completely plated with gold and some twelve hundred spires most of  which are surmounted by a golden cross. At the time of sunset they  seem literally tipped with flame. It was from this memorable spot  that Napoleon and the Grand Army first obtained a glimpse at the  city of the Tsars. There are three hundred and seventy churches in  Moscow. The Kremlin itself is however by far the most interesting  object to the stranger.]    XXXV    Lo! compassed by his grove of oaks,  Petrovski Palace! Gloomily  His recent glory he invokes.  Here, drunk with his late victory,  Napoleon tarried till it please  Moscow approach on bended knees,  Time-honoured Kremlin's keys present.  Not so! My Moscow never went  To seek him out with bended head.  No gift she bears, no feast proclaims,  But lights incendiary flames  For the impatient chief instead.  From hence engrossed in thought profound  He on the conflagration frowned.(74)    [Note 74: Napoleon on his arrival in Moscow on the 14th September  took up his quarters in the Kremlin, but on the 16th had to  remove to the Petrovski Palace or Castle on account of the  conflagration which broke out in all quarters of the city. He  however returned to the Kremlin on the 19th September. The Palace  itself is placed in the midst of extensive grounds just outside  the city, on the road to Tver, i.e. to the northwest. It is  perhaps worthy of remark, as one amongst numerous circumstances  proving how extensively the poet interwove his own life-experiences  with the plot of this poem, that it was by this road that he  himself must have been in the habit of approaching Moscow from his  favourite country residence of Mikhailovskoe, in the province of  Pskoff.]    XXXVI    Adieu, thou witness of our glory,  Petrovski Palace; come, astir!  Drive on! the city barriers hoary  Appear; along the road of Tver  The coach is borne o'er ruts and holes,  Past women, sentry-boxes, rolls,  Past palaces and nunneries,  Lamp-posts, shops, sledges, families,  Bokharians, peasants, beds of greens,  Boulevards, belfries, milliners,  Huts, chemists, Cossacks, shopkeepers  And fashionable magazines,  Balconies, lion's heads on doors,  Jackdaws on every spire--in scores.(75)    [Note 75: The first line refers to the prevailing shape of the  cast-iron handles which adorn the _porte cocheres_. The  Russians are fond of tame birds--jackdaws, pigeons, starlings,  etc., abound in Moscow and elsewhere.]    XXXVII    The weary way still incomplete,  An hour passed by--another--till,  Near Khariton's in a side street  The coach before a house stood still.  At an old aunt's they had arrived  Who had for four long years survived  An invalid from lung complaint.  A Kalmuck gray, in caftan rent  And spectacles, his knitting staid  And the saloon threw open wide;  The princess from the sofa cried  And the newcomers welcome bade.  The two old ladies then embraced  And exclamations interlaced.    XXXVIII    \"Princesse, mon ange!\"--\"Pachette!\"--  \"Aline!\"  \"Who would have thought it? As of yore!  Is it for long?\"--\"Ma chere cousine!\"  \"Sit down. How funny, to be sure!  'Tis a scene of romance, I vow!\"  \"Tania, my eldest child, you know\"--  \"Ah! come, Tattiana, come to me!  Is it a dream, and can it be?  Cousin, rememb'rest Grandison?\"  \"What! Grandison?\"--\"Yes, certainly!\"  \"Oh! I remember, where is he?\"--  \"Here, he resides with Simeon.  He called upon me Christmas Eve--  His son is married, just conceive!\"    XXXIX    \"And he--but of him presently--  To-morrow Tania we will show,  What say you? to the family--  Alas! abroad I cannot go.  See, I can hardly crawl about--  But you must both be quite tired out!  Let us go seek a little rest--  Ah! I'm so weak--my throbbing breast!  Oppressive now is happiness,  Not only sorrow--Ah! my dear,  Now I am fit for nothing here.  In old age life is weariness!\"  Then weeping she sank back distressed  And fits of coughing racked her chest.    XL    By the sick lady's gaiety  And kindness Tania was impressed,  But, her own room in memory,  The strange apartment her oppressed:  Repose her silken curtains fled,  She could not sleep in her new bed.  The early tinkling of the bells  Which of approaching labour tells  Aroused Tattiana from her bed.  The maiden at her casement sits  As daylight glimmers, darkness flits,  But ah! discerns nor wood nor mead--  Beneath her lay a strange courtyard,  A stable,"]]]
