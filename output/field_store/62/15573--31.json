The watch and chain was worth $200. Mrs. Bethune  subsequently learned that the watch had been pledged. Some time after,  she, Mrs. Bethune, caused the arrest of Kate Fisher at Pittsburgh, but  the case was dismissed for want of jurisdiction.    Mr. Howe then asked if the counsel had closed his case, but received an  answer in the negative, as there were more witnesses to be examined. Mr.  Howe stated that he was sorry that the case was not closed, as before he  desired to commence a cross-examination he would take all the evidence  to be exhausted. His case was a revival of one which had already been  settled at the General Sessions, and bore on its very face the evidence  of a malicious prosecution to injure the character and spotless  reputation of a lady whose profession brought her constantly before the  public, and whose good name became thereby part of her business capital.  He regretted it, therefore, that the counsel for the complainant would  not exhaust his case, as it made it necessary to adopt a course of  procedure in his cross-examination that he should have preferred not to  have done.    The counsel for Mrs. Bethune persisting that the cross-examination of  each witness should go on in regular order as each witness appeared on  the stand, Mr. Howe then proceeded by asking the witness her name.    My name is Eliza Bethune.    Are you married?    I am.    To whom?    Mr. Bethune.    What is his first name?    That is not your business.    Counsel appealed to the court, when the magistrate said the question was  a proper one, and she answered:    My husband's name is Bethune. His first name I do not choose to give.    After further questioning, she at last replied:    My first husband's name was John Bethune.    What is the name of your present husband?    That is not your business.    Is he here in court.    He is. He represents me here.    What is his first name?    After a great deal of cross-firing the answer was elicited that it was  George Bethune.    Were you ever married to George Bethune, the one who is now in court?    Objected to by counsel.    Justice Shandley: That is a proper question, and must be answered.    That is my business. He has been my husband for over ten years.    Were you ever married to him?    Objected to. Objection overruled.    I have answered already. I have answered all I am going to do.    Justice Shandley insisted that she must answer the questions, but when  she still refused, almost in a defiant manner, he rose from the bench,  and declared the case dismissed. His action was received with rounds of  applause from the persons assembled.        CHAPTER X.    A MARINER'S WOOING.    _Captain Hazard's Gushing Letters--Breakers on a Matrimonial Lee  Shore--He is Grounded in Divorce Shoals_.    Aforetime, when the mariner was entirely dependent on the winds and the  tides to make his voyage, he was, as everybody knows, a peculiarly  impulsive, generous, faithful and credulous mortal in his love affairs.  Once ashore, he spliced the main-brace, sneered oathfully at  land-lubbers, hitched up his trousers and ran alongside the first  trim-looking craft who angled for his attentions--and his money. These  fine salt-water impulses, begotten of a twelve or fifteen-months'  voyage, have mostly vanished. Steam has greatly revolutionized Jack's  sweet-hearting. He comes to port every fortnight, or so; he wears dry  goods and jewelry of the latest mode; and he marries a wife, or divorces  a wife, with the same conventional _sangfroid_ of any mercantile  \"drummer\" who travels by railroad. The conjugal history of that  distinguished son of Neptune, Captain Oliver Perry Hazard, now to be  related, haply has a delectable smack of mercantile jack's old-time  methods, mingled with the shrewder utilitarianism of the steamship Jack  of to-day.    Up in the estuary called the Y, and at the mouth of the river Amstel,  lay, some years ago, the good American ship which had safely borne young  Hazard across the Atlantic. He was a handsome, a tall, and a lively  young man of five and twenty; and, with a vivacious young mariner's  curiosity, he went ashore to sample the \"Holland,\" for which the Dutch  are so famous, to stroll across the two hundred and ninety-odd bridges,  and to take an observation of the pretty girls that loomed up in sedate  but ample old Amsterdam. There, in a saloon where the gin was a most  divine Hippocrene, and the cigars fragrant, Oliver beheld a tight little  craft, and straightway ran up his flag as a salute. She was a brunette,  with as pretty a form as the sun had ever kissed. Her dark, dark eyes  were large, lustrous and superb. Oliver shares Lord Byron's weakness for  handsome eyes. He's very fond of them. The name of the Amsterdam  divinity was Marie. He resembled the same illustrious poet in his  predilection for the name of Mary or Marie. He thought there was a  sweetness in it. And so he sank into the quicksands of Eros, right over  his tarry toplights, and, nothing loth, Marie accompanied him in the  Avernian descent. Every morning that he lay in the Dutch port our  mariner squared his yard-arms and trimmed himself for bringing-to  alongside Marie. Every night the tics were getting tauter, and when he  proposed that she should cross with him to England there was no pitching  on her part worth speaking of. And so they voyaged to Albion and to  several ports in Gaul; and there was no lee-way in their love, but still  the tics were getting tauter, evidencing strong probabilities of a life  cruise together.    A year or two after, both Oliver and Marie were in New York, and,  according to the affidavit of Captain Hazard's mother, Marie called upon  the matron and told her \"that she had been living with her son Oliver;  that she had first met him in Amsterdam, and had traveled with him as  his wife in England and in France, and that he had brought her to  America.\" Marie assured the old lady that she loved him dearly, that she  had been faithful and true to him ever since their intimacy, and hence  she was anxious that Oliver should marry her and make her an honest  woman in the eyes of the law and of the world. Whereupon, the mother  persuaded the son to marry the pretty, young, gazelle-eyed girl, who  could speak American and write like a born citizen.    Oliver's own account of this momentous event, as chronicled in his  affidavit, is not materially different. He affirms that he first met  Marie in a liquor store in Amsterdam, \"which she was in the habit of  frequenting. At this time she was of loose character;\" she \"lived with  him and traveled to England and France, and he was going to send her  back to Holland, when his mother urged him to marry her, which he did  reluctantly.\"    In what way or to what extent, if any, the relations between the young  mariner and his wife were affected after Hymen had stepped in and  chained them together, there are data for determining. If we are to  unqualifiedly accept the averments of the captain's affidavit we should  come to the conclusion that Marie's nature and disposition were woefully  transformed when she could legally designate herself, \"Mrs. Captain  Oliver P. Hazard.\" She then discovered \"a jealous disposition\" and \"an  ungovernable temper.\" When he returned from his various voyages she \"did  not receive him kindly;\" but, contrariwise, sometimes received him on  the side of \"a poker,\" on the end of \"a dirk\" or at the muzzle of  \"pistol.\" Moreover--and this is dolefully comic--\"she repeatedly left  this deponent imprisoned in the house for hours under lock and key!\"  What a situation for a foaming mariner, accustomed to roam the vastness  of the majestic, the free, the uncontrollable deep! Probably the next  arraignment is still more exasperating. \"She kept a servant to act as a  spy and treat this deponent with disrespect.\" With the lapse of years,  and with the peculiar hue which strife assumes in its backward  prospective, his once happy-home and connubial comforts wore a jaundiced  and sickly aspect. He ceased to recall the days when his heart was  linked unto Marie's as a rosebud is linked to its stem.    Mrs. Hazard possessed some letters, written to her by her whilom amorous  husband, which will enable the reader to form a pretty correct idea of  the estimation in which, until quite recently, the captain held his  pretty wife. For example, one Fourth of July, he writes from \"On board  the U. S. Steamer John Rice,\" from Fortress Monroe to \"My own dear and  precious wife,\" informing her that the ship has been landing troops,  that he feels rather seedy and low-spirited, and wishes he was at home  to spend \"the glorious Fourth\" in her company. In a postscript he blazes  into amorous enthusiasm and exclaims, \"Write your dear Olly!\" and in the  bottom left-hand corner, within a sort of fairy circle, about the size  of the orifice of a quart-bottle neck, appeared the gushing invitation,  (\"Kiss me.\")    Nearly a year afterward he writes from Havana, \"On board the steamer  Liberty, May 6, 1865,\" to \"My own dear precious wife,\" informing her  that he is safe from New Orleans, with other personal matters not  necessary to rehearse. He subscribes himself, \"Your affectionate and  loving Olly.\" Over ten years afterward we find the captain writing  another letter from on board the same steamer, October 13, 1875, lying  in Savannah, to \"My darling beloved wife,\" in which he graphically tells  her the sort of dog Jocko is. \"Jocko came on board all serene,\" writes  the captain, \"He is asleep under my sofa all the time when he is not  hunting beef, and I keep my room very warm. So that is the kind of dog  Jocko is. If he was a half decent dog I would keep him on board, but he  is asleep all the day under my sofa, and hates to be on deck. So he is  good for nix, the worse cur I ever saw. I will leave him with a good  keeper, and glad"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24726"],[0,"A History of Art for Beginners and Students: Painting, Sculpture, Architecture (#20)"],[1,"was promised that the other portion should be given him. From this  much trouble arose, because both purchasers determined to keep what they  had, and each claimed that the whole belonged to him, and as they were  equally obstinate, the two parts of the same work have never been  reunited. Fortunately, each half makes a picture by itself.    The frescoes at Parma are the greatest works of this master, and it is  very interesting to visit that quaint old city; his works are in the  Cathedral, the Church of St. John the Evangelist, and in the parlor of the  Convent of the Benedictine Nuns. This last is a wonderful room. The  ceiling is arched and high, and painted to represent an arbor of vines  with sixteen oval openings, out of which frolicsome children are peeping,  as if, in passing around behind the vines, they had stopped to look down  into the room. The pictures here will make you understand the effect  (Figs. 48 and 49). Beneath each of these openings or lunettes is a  half-circular picture of some mythological story or personage. Upon the  wall of the parlor, above the mantel, there is a picture of Diana, the  goddess of the moon and the protector of young animals, which is a  beautiful picture.    When Correggio worked on the frescoes at the Church of St. John, he lived  much in the monastery connected with it. The monks became very fond of  him, and made him a member of the Congregation Cassinensi; the poet Tasso  also was a member of this fraternity. This membership gave him the right  to share in the masses, prayers, and alms of the community, and after his  death the same offices for the repose of his soul would be performed as if  he had been a true monk.    [Illustration: FIG. 49.--LOWER PART OF A FRESCO BY CORREGGIO.]    The works of Correggio are very rarely sold. The madonna in the National  Gallery, London, known as \"_La Vierge au Panier_,\" was formerly in the  Royal Gallery at Madrid. During the French invasion of Spain, Mr. Wallace,  an English artist, obtained it. It is painted on a panel, and is 13-1/2  inches high by 10 inches wide. In 1813 it was offered for sale in London  at twelve hundred pounds. In 1825 it was sold in Paris for eighty thousand  francs, and soon after sold to the National Gallery for thirty-eight  hundred pounds, or nearly nineteen thousand dollars.    A copy of the \"Reading Magdalen\" was sold to Earl Dudley for sixteen  hundred pounds, or more than seven thousand dollars.    Correggio had but few pupils, but he had many imitators. The one most  worthy of mention was FRANCESCO MAZZUOLI (1503-1540), called IL  PARMIGIANO, or PARMIGIANINO. He was not a great painter. The \"Vision of  St. Jerome,\" in the National Gallery, London, is one of his best works. It  is said that during the sack of Rome, in 1527, he was painting the figures  of the Virgin and Child in this picture, and was so engrossed by his work  that the invaders entered his studio, and surrounded him before he was  aware of their approach. And they, for their part, were so moved by what  they saw that they went away, and left him undisturbed.    Art writers often use the term \"early masters.\" This denotes Michael  Angelo, Raphael, and other men so great that they were very prominent in  the history of art, and were imitated by so many followers that they had  an unusual effect upon the world. Titian may be called the last of these  great masters of the early school, and his life was so long that he lived  to see a great decline in art.    The painters of the close of the sixteenth century are called  \"Mannerists,\" which means that they adopted or imitated the manner or  style of some great master who had preceded them--and this was done in so  cold and spiritless a way that it may be said that true artistic  inspiration was dead in Italy. No one lived who, out of his own  imagination, could fix upon the wall or the canvas such scenes as would  befit a poet's dream or serve to arouse the enthusiasm of those who saw  the painted story born in the artist's brain.    About 1600, the beginning of the seventeenth century, there arose a new  movement in Italian art, which resulted in forming two schools between  which there came to be much bitterness of feeling, and even deadly hatred.  On one side there were those who wished to continue the study and  imitation of the works of the old masters, but with this they united a  study of nature. These men were called \"Eclectics,\" because they elected  or chose certain parts of different systems of painting, and from these  formed a new manner of their own.    Opposed to the Eclectics were the \"Naturalists,\" who insisted that nature  only should be studied, and that everything should be represented in the  most realistic way, and made to appear in the picture exactly as it did in  reality, not being beautified or adorned by any play of fancy or  imagination.    The chief school of the Eclectics, of whom I will first speak, was at  Bologna, and is known also as the \"school of the Caracci,\" because  LUDOVICO CARACCI (1555-1619) was at the head of a large academy there, and  was assisted by his nephews, AGOSTINO CARACCI (1558-1601) and ANNIBALE  CARACCI (1560-1609), the latter being the greatest artist of the three.  The lives of the Caracci are not of such interest as to require an account  of them here, neither are their works so interesting that we may not leave  these artists by saying that they have great consideration as the heads of  the Eclectic Academy, and for the work they did in it at an important era  in the history of Italian art; but the fruits of their work are shown in  that of their scholars rather than in their own paintings, and in this  view their influence can scarcely be overvalued.    The greatest of their scholars was DOMENICO ZAMPIERI (1581-1641), called  DOMENICHINO, who was born at Bologna, and was instructed by Denis Calvert,  who forbade his drawing after the works of Annibale Caracci. Domenico  disobeyed this command, and was so severely treated by Calvert that he  persuaded his father to take him from that master, and place him in the  school of the Caracci. When he entered the Academy he was so dull that his  fellow-pupils nicknamed him \"The Ox;\" but Annibale Caracci said: \"Take  care: this ox will surpass you all by and by, and will be an honor to his  art.\" Domenichino soon began to win many prizes in the school, and left it  well trained and prepared for a brilliant career.    He gave much thought to his art, shunned private society, and if he went  out at all he frequented public places where large numbers of people were  gathered, thus affording him an opportunity to study their varying  expressions. He also tried to feel in himself the emotions of the person  he was painting. For instance, it is said that when he was painting the  \"Scourging of St. Andrew,\" he threw himself into a passion, and used  threatening gestures and high words. In the midst of this his master,  Annibale Caracci, surprised him, and was so impressed with his method that  he threw his arms about his pupil's neck, exclaiming, \"To-day, my  Domenichino, thou art teaching me!\"    The most celebrated work by Domenichino is the \"Communion of St. Jerome,\"  in the Vatican. It is universally considered the second picture in Rome,  the \"Transfiguration,\" by Raphael, being the only one that is placed  before it. The scene it represents is just before the death of the saint,  when he was borne into the chapel to receive the sacrament of the  communion for the last time (Fig. 50).    [Illustration: FIG. 50.--COMMUNION OF ST. JEROME.]    Domenichino was made very unhappy in Rome, on account of the jealousy of  other artists, and he returned to Bologna. However, his fame had reached  the court at Naples, and the viceroy of that city invited the artist to  decorate the Chapel of St. Januarius. There was in Naples at that time an  association of artists who had determined that no strange artist should be  allowed to do work of any account in their city. As soon as Domenichino  began his work, therefore, he received letters threatening his life. His  colors were spoiled by having ruinous chemicals mixed with them, his  sketches were stolen from his studio, and all sorts of insults and  indignities were heaped upon him.    After a time, the painter was so disheartened that he fled to Rome; but  the viceroy sent for him and took every precaution possible to protect him  and enable him to work in peace. But just as all seemed to be going well  he sickened and died, and it has always been said that he was poisoned. Be  this as it may, there is no doubt that the fear, vexation, and anxiety of  his life caused his death, and on this account his tormentors were his  murderers.    The works of Domenichino are not numerous, and are not seen in as many  galleries as are those of some Italian painters; but there are a  considerable number scattered over Europe and very beautiful ones in  several galleries in Rome.    The next painter of importance in the Eclectic school was GUIDO RENI  (1575-1642), born at Bologna, and the son of a professor of music. His  father intended that Guido also should be a musician, and the poor boy was  much persecuted on account of his love for drawing. But after many  struggles the boy came into the Caracci school, and was soon a favorite  pupil there.    When still young he listened with great attention to a lecture from  Annibale, in which he laid down the rules which should govern a true  painter. Guido resolved to follow these rules closely, and soon he painted  so well that he was accused of trying to establish a new system of  painting. At last Ludovico Caracci turned against him and dismissed him  from his school.    [Illustration: FIG. 51.--AURORA. _By Guido Reni._]    The young artist went to Rome; but his persecutions did not cease, and it  seemed to be his fate to excite the jealousy of other painters.
