The poor princess was put under the care of Prince Ghazan,  the son of Prince Arghun, who did not ascend the throne until 1295,  when his uncle, the usurper, was strangled. What became of the  princess we do not hear, but on parting with Nicolo, Matteo, and  Marco Polo, she bestowed on them great marks of favour. It was  probably during Marco Polo's residence in Persia that he collected  some curious documents upon Turkey in Asia; they are disconnected  pieces, which he gives at the close of his narrative, and they form  a genuine history of the Mongol Khans of Persia. His travels for  exploration were at an end, and after taking leave of the Tartar  princess, the three Venetians well escorted, and with all expenses  paid, set out on their way home. They went to Trebizond, then to  Constantinople, and thence to Negropont, where they embarked for  Venice.    It was in the year 1295, twenty-four years after leaving it, that  Marco Polo and his companions returned to their native town. They  were bronzed by exposure to the air and sun, coarsely clad in Tartar  costume, and both in manners and language were so much more  Mongolian than Venetian, that even their nearest relatives failed to  recognize them. Beyond this, a report had been widely spread that  they were dead, and it had gained so much credence that their  friends never expected to see them again. They went to their own  house in the part of Venice called St. John Chrysostom, and found it  occupied by different members of the Polo family, who received the  travellers with every mark of distrust, which their pitiable  appearance did not tend to lessen, and placed no faith in the  somewhat marvellous stories related to them by Marco Polo. After  some persuasion, however, they gained admittance into their own  house. When they had been a few days in Venice, the three travellers  gave a magnificent banquet, followed by a splendid fete, to do away  with any remaining doubts as to their identity. They invited the  nobility of Venice and all the members of their own family, and when  all the guests were assembled the three hosts appeared dressed in  crimson satin robes; the guests then entered the dining-room, and  the feast began. After the first course was over the three  travellers retired for a few moments and then reappeared, clad in  robes of splendid silk damask, which they proceeded to tear, and to  present each of their guests with a piece. After the second course  they dressed themselves in even more splendid robes of crimson  velvet, which they wore until the feast was over, when they appeared  in simple Venetian costume. The astonished guests marvelled at the  magnificence of these garments, and wondered what their hosts would  next show them; then the coarse rough clothes that they had worn on  the voyage were brought in, and when the linings and seams were  undone, rubies, sapphires, emeralds, diamonds, and carbuncles of  great value were poured forth from them; great riches had been  hidden in these rags. This unexpected sight cleared away all doubt;  the three travellers were recognized at once as Marco, Nicolo, and  Matteo Polo, and congratulations upon their return were showered  upon them.    So celebrated a man as Marco Polo could not escape civic honours. He  was made first magistrate in Venice, and as he was continually  speaking of the \"millions\" of the Grand Khan, who commanded  \"millions\" of subjects, he gained the soubriquet of Signor Million.    It was about 1296 that a war broke out between Venice and Genoa. A  Genoese fleet under the command of Lamba Doria crossed the Adriatic,  and threatened the sea coast. The Venetian Admiral Andrea Dandolo  immediately manned a larger fleet and entrusted the command of a  galley to Marco Polo who was justly considered an able commander.  The Venetians were beaten in a naval battle on the 8th of September,  1296, and Marco Polo, badly wounded, fell into the hands of the  Genoese, who, knowing and appreciating the value of their prisoner,  treated him with great kindness. He was taken to Genoa, and there  met with a hearty welcome from the most distinguished people, who  were anxious to hear the account of his travels. It was during his  captivity, in 1298, that he made acquaintance with Pisano Rusticien,  and, tired of repeating his story again and again, dictated his  narrative to him.    About 1299 Marco Polo was set at liberty; he returned to Venice, and  there married. From this time we hear no more of the incidents of  his life, and only know from his will that he left three daughters;  he is thought to have died about the 9th of January, 1323, at the  age of seventy.    Such is the life of this celebrated traveller, whose narrative had a  marked influence on the progress of geographical science. He was  gifted with great power of observation, and could see and describe  equally well; and all later explorers have confirmed the truth of  his statements. Until the middle of the eighteenth century, the  documents founded on this narrative formed the basis of geographical  books, and were used as a guide in commercial expeditions to China,  India, and Central Asia. Posterity will concur in the suitability of  the title that the first copyists gave to Marco Polo's work, that of  \"The Book of the Wonders of the World.\"          CHAPTER V.  IBN BATUTA, 1328-1353.    Ibn Batuta--The Nile--Gaza, Tyre, Tiberias, Libanus, Baalbec,  Damascus, Meshid, Bussorah, Baghdad, Tabriz, Mecca and Medina--  Yemen--Abyssinia--The country of the Berbers--Zanguebar--Ormuz--  Syria--Anatolia--Asia Minor--Astrakhan--Constantinople--  Turkestan--Herat--The Indus--Delhi--Malabar--The Maldives--  Ceylon--The Coromandel coast--Bengal--The Nicobar Islands--  Sumatra--China--Africa--The Niger--Timbuctoo.      Marco Polo had returned to his native land now nearly twenty-five  years, when a Franciscan monk traversed the whole of Asia, from the  Black Sea to the extreme limits of China, passing by Trebizond,  Mount Ararat, Babel, and the island of Java; but he was so credulous  of all that was told him, and his narrative is so confused, that but  little reliance can be placed upon it. It is the same with the  fabulous travels of Jean de Mandeville. Cooley says of them, \"They  are so utterly untrue, that they have not their parallel in any  language.\"    But we find a worthy successor to the Venetian traveller in an  Arabian theologian, named Abdallah El Lawati, better known by the  name of Ibn Batuta. He did for Egypt, Arabia, Anatolia, Tartary,  India, China, Bengal, and Soudan, what Marco Polo had done for  Central Asia, and he is worthy to be placed in the foremost rank as  a brave traveller and bold explorer. In the year 1324, the 725th  year of the Hegira, he resolved to make a pilgrimage to Mecca, and  starting from Tangier, his native town, he went first to Alexandria,  and thence to Cairo. During his stay in Egypt he turned his  attention to the Nile, and especially to the Delta; then he tried to  sail up the river, but being stopped by disturbances on the Nubian  frontier, he was obliged to return to the mouth of the river, and  then set sail for Asia Minor.    [Illustration: Ibn Batuta in Egypt.]    After visiting Gaza, the tombs of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, Tyre,  then strongly fortified and unassailable on three sides, and  Tiberias, which was in ruins, and whose celebrated baths were  completely destroyed, Ibn Batuta was attracted by the wonders of  Lebanon, the centre for all the hermits of that day, who had  judiciously chosen one of the most lovely spots in the whole world  wherein to end their days. Then passing Baalbec, and going on to  Damascus, he found the city (in the year 1345) decimated by the  plague. This fearful scourge devoured \"24,000 persons daily,\" if we  may believe his report, and Damascus would have been depopulated,  had not the prayers of all the people offered up in the mosque  containing the stone with the print of Moses' foot upon it, been  heard and answered. On leaving Damascus, Ibn Batuta went to Mesjid,  where he visited the tomb of Ali, which attracts a large number of  paralytic pilgrims who need only to spend one night in prayer beside  it, to be completely cured. Batuta does not seem to doubt the  authenticity of this miracle, well known in the East under the title  of \"the Night of Cure.\"    From Mesjid, the traveller went to Bussorah, and entered the kingdom  of Ispahan, and then the province of Shiraz, where he wished to  converse with the celebrated worker of miracles, Magd Oddin. From  Shiraz he went to Baghdad, to Tabriz, then to Medina, where he  prayed beside the tomb of the Prophet, and finally to Mecca, where  he remained three years. It is well known that from Mecca, caravans  are continually starting for the surrounding country, and it was in  company with some of these bold merchants that Ibn Batuta was able  to visit the towns of Yemen. He went as far as Aden, at the mouth of  the Red Sea, and embarked for Zaila, one of the Abyssinian ports. He  was now once more on African ground, and advanced into the country  of the Berbers, that he might study the manners and customs of those  dirty and repulsive tribes; he found their diet consisted wholly of  fish and camels' flesh. But in the town of Makdasbu, there was an  attempt at comfort and civilization, presenting a most agreeable  contrast with the surrounding squalor. The inhabitants were very fat,  each of them, to use Ibn's own expression, \"eating enough to feed a  convent;\" they were very fond of delicacies, such as plantains  boiled in milk, preserved citrons, pods of fresh pepper, and green  ginger.    After seeing all he wished of the country of the Berbers, chiefly on  the coast, he resolved to go to Zanguebar, and then, crossing the  Red Sea and following the coast of Arabia, he came to Zafar, a town  situated upon the Indian Ocean.

For the same political  and military reason, the Governor-General hopes to be able before the  negotiations are closed to make arrangements by which Cashmere may be  added to the possessions of Gholab Singh, declaring the Rajpoot Hill  States with Cashmere independent of the Sikhs of the Plains. The Sikhs  declare their inability to pay the indemnity of one million and a  half, and will probably offer Cashmere as an equivalent. In this case,  if Gholab Singh pays the money demanded for the expenses of the war,  the district of Cashmere will be ceded by the British to him, and the  Rajah become one of the Princes of Hindostan.    There are difficulties in the way of this arrangement, but considering  the military power which the Sikh nation has exhibited of bringing  into the field 80,000 men and 300 pieces of field artillery, it  appears to the Governor-General most politic to diminish the means of  this warlike people to repeat a similar aggression. The nation is in  fact a dangerous military Republic on our weakest frontier. If the  British Army had been defeated, the Sikhs, through the Protected  States, which would have risen in their favour in case of a reverse,  would have captured Delhi, and a people having 50,000 regular troops  and 300 pieces of field artillery in a standing permanent camp within  50 miles of Ferozepore, is a state of things that cannot be tolerated  for the future....    The energy and intrepidity displayed by your Majesty's  Commander-in-Chief, Sir Hugh Gough, his readiness to carry on the  service in cordial co-operation with the Governor-General, and the  marked bravery and invincibility of your Majesty's English troops,  have overcome many serious obstacles, and the precautions taken have  been such that no disaster or failure, however trifling, has attended  the arduous efforts of your Majesty's Arms.        [Footnote 3: The Sikhs were defeated at Sobraon on 10th      February by the British troops under Sir Hugh Gough,      reinforced by Sir Harry Smith, fresh from his victory at      Aliwal. _See_ p. 71.]          [Pageheading: PEEL'S ANXIETIES]      _Queen Victoria to the King of the Belgians._    OSBORNE, _3rd March 1846._    MY DEAREST UNCLE,--I hasten to thank you for a most dear and kind  letter of the 28th, which I received this morning. You know how I  love and esteem my dearest Louise; she is the dearest friend, after my  beloved Albert, I have.    I wish you could be here, and hope you will come here for a few days  during your stay, to see the innumerable alterations and improvements  which have taken place. My dearest Albert is so happy here, out all  day planting, directing, etc., and it is so good for him. It is a  relief to be away from all the bitterness which people create for  themselves in London. Peel has a very anxious and a very peculiar  position, and it is the force of circumstances and the great energy  he _alone possesses_ which will carry him through the Session. He  certainly acts a most disinterested part, for did he not feel (as  _every one_ who is fully acquainted with the _real state_ of the  country must feel) that the line he pursues is the _only right_ and  sound one for the welfare of this country, he never would have  exposed himself to all the annoyance and pain of being attacked by his  friends. He was, however, determined to have done this before the next  general election, but the alarming state of distress in Ireland forced  him to do it now. I must, however, leave him to explain to you fully  himself the peculiar circumstances of the present very irregular state  of affairs. His majority was _not_ a _certain_ one _last year_, for on  Maynooth, upwards of a _hundred_ of his followers voted against him.    The state of affairs in India is very serious. I am glad you do  justice to the bravery of our good people.          [Pageheading: DEATH OF SIR ROBERT SALE]      _Queen Victoria to Sir Henry Hardinge._    OSBORNE, _4th March 1846._    The Queen is anxious to seize the first opportunity of expressing to  Sir Henry Hardinge, her admiration of his conduct on the last most  trying occasion, and of the courage and gallantry of the officers and  men who had so severe a contest to endure.[4] Their conduct has been  in every way worthy of the British name, and both the Prince and Queen  are deeply impressed with it. The severe loss we have sustained in  so many brave officers and men is very painful, and must alloy the  satisfaction every one feels at the brilliant successes of our Arms.  Most deeply do we lament the death of Sir Robert Sale, Sir John  M'Caskill,[5] and Major Broadfoot,[6] and most deeply do we sympathise  with that high-minded woman, Lady Sale, who has had the misfortune  to lose her husband less than three years after she was released from  captivity and restored to him.    We are truly rejoiced to hear that Sir H. Hardinge's health has  not suffered, and that he and his brave son have been so mercifully  preserved. The Queen will look forward with great anxiety to the next  news from India.        [Footnote 4: At Moodkee on 18th December, and Ferozeshah on      21st and 22nd December.]        [Footnote 5: Who had commanded a brigade under Pollock in the      second Afghan campaign.]        [Footnote 6: Major George Broadfoot, C.B., Political Agent on      the north-western frontier.]          [Pageheading: THE PRINCE'S MEMORANDUM]      _Memorandum by the Prince Albert._    BUCKINGHAM PALACE, _1st April 1846._    I saw this day Sir R. Peel, and showed him a memorandum, which I had  drawn up respecting our conversation of the 30th.    It filled six sheets, and contained, as minutely as I could render  it, the whole of the arguments we had gone through. Sir Robert read  it through and over again, and, after a long pause, said: \"I was not  aware when I spoke to your Royal Highness that my words would be taken  down, and don't acknowledge that this is a fair representation of my  opinion.\" He was visibly uneasy, and added, if he knew that what he  said should be committed to paper, he would speak differently, and  give his opinion with all the circumspection and reserve which a  Minister ought to employ when he gave responsible advice; but he had  in this instance spoken quite unreservedly, like an advocate defending  a point in debate, and then he had taken another and tried to carry  this as far as it would go, in order to give me an opportunity of  judging of the different bearings of the question. He did so often in  the Cabinet, when they discussed important questions, and was often  asked: \"Well, then, you are quite against this measure?\" \"Not at  all, but I want that the counter argument should be gone into to the  fullest extent, in order that the Cabinet should not take a one-sided  view.\"    He viewed the existence of such a paper with much uneasiness, as it  might appear as if he had left this before going out of office in  order to prepossess the Queen against the measures, which her future  Minister might propose to her, and so lay secretly the foundation  of his fall. The existence of such a paper might cause great  embarrassment to the Queen; if she followed the advice of a Minister  who proposed measures hostile to the Irish Church, it might be said,  she knew what she undertook, for Sir R. Peel had warned her and left  on record the serious objections that attached to the measure.    I said that I felt it to be of the greatest importance to possess  his views on the question, but that I thought I would not have been  justified in keeping a record of our conversation without showing it  to him, and asking him whether I had rightly understood him; but if  he felt a moment's uneasiness about this memorandum, I would at once  destroy it, as I was anxious that nothing should prevent his  speaking without the slightest reserve to me in future as he had done  heretofore. I felt that these open discussions were of the greatest  use to me in my endeavour to investigate the different political  questions of the day and to form a conclusive opinion upon them.  As Sir Robert did not say a word to dissuade me, I took it as an  affirmative, and threw the memorandum into the fire, which, I could  see, relieved Sir Robert.    ALBERT.          _Mr Gladstone to Queen Victoria._    13 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, _1st April 1846._    Mr William Gladstone presents his humble duty to your Majesty, and  prays that he may be honoured with your Majesty's permission to direct  that the Park and Tower Guns may be fired forthwith in celebration of  the victory which was achieved by your Majesty's forces over the Sikh  army in Sobraon on the 10th of February.[7]        [Footnote 7: In September 1882 Mr Gladstone quoted this as      a precedent for firing the Park Guns after the victory of      Tel-el-Kebir.
