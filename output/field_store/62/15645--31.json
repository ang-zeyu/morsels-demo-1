Porphyry remarked  and exactly described it among the Egyptians--\"common and akin to men  and gods they believed the beasts to be.\"(2) The belief in such equality  is alien to modern civilisation. We have shown that it is common and  fundamental in savagery. For instance, in the Pacific, we might quote  Turner,(3) and for Melanesia, Codrington,(4) while for New Zealand we  have Taylor.(5) For the Jakuts, along the banks of the Lena in Northern  Asia, we have the evidence of Strahlenberg, who writes: \"Each tribe of  these people look upon some particular creature as sacred, e.g., a swan,  goose, raven, etc., and such is not eaten by that tribe\" though the  others may eat it.(6) As the majority of our witnesses were quite  unaware that the facts they described were common among races of whom  many of them had never even heard, their evidence may surely be accepted  as valid, especially as the beliefs testified to express themselves in  marriage laws, in the blood-feud, in abstinence from food, on pillars  over graves, in rude heraldry, and in other obvious and palpable  shapes. If we have not made out, by the evidence of institutions, that  a confused credulity concerning the equality and kinship of man and the  objects in nature is actually a ruling belief among savages, and even  higher races, from the Lena to the Amazon, from the Gold Coast to  Queensland, we may despair of ever convincing an opponent. The survival  of the same beliefs and institutions among civilised races, Aryan and  others, will later be demonstrated.(7) If we find that the mythology of  civilised races here agrees with the actual practical belief of savages,  and if we also find that civilised races retain survivals of the  institutions in which the belief is expressed by savages, then we may  surely infer that the activity of beasts in the myths of Greece springs  from the same sources as the similar activity of beasts in the myths of  Iroquois or Kaffirs. That is to say, part of the irrational element  in Greek myth will be shown to be derived (whether by inheritance or  borrowing) from an ascertained condition of savage fancy.

The second feature in the savage intellectual condition which we  promised to investigate was the belief in magic and sorcery. The world  and all the things in it being conceived of vaguely as sensible and  rational, are supposed to obey the commands of certain members of each  tribe, such as chiefs, jugglers, or conjurors. These conjurors, like  Zeus or Indra, can affect the weather, work miracles, assume what  shapes, animal, vegetable, or inorganic, they please, and can  metamorphose other persons into similar shapes. It has already been  shown that savage man has regarded all THINGS as PERSONS much on a level  with himself. It has now to be shown WHAT KIND OF PERSON HE CONCEIVES  HIMSELF TO BE. He does not look on men as civilised races regard them,  that is, as beings with strict limitations. On the other hand, he thinks  of certain members of his tribe as exempt from most of the limitations,  and capable of working every miracle that tradition has ever attributed  to prophets or gods. Nor are such miraculous powers, such practical  omnipotence, supposed by savages to be at all rare among themselves.  Though highly valued, miraculous attainments are not believed to be  unusual. This must be kept steadily in mind. When myth-making man  regards the sky or sun or wind as a person, he does not mean merely  a person with the limitations recognised by modern races. He means a  person with the miraculous powers of the medicine-man. The sky, sun,  wind or other elemental personage can converse with the dead, and can  turn himself and his neighbours into animals, stones and trees.    To understand these functions and their exercise, it is necessary to  examine what may be called savage science, savage metaphysics, and the  savage theory of the state of the dead. The medicine-man's supernatural  claims are rooted in the general savage view of the world, of what is  possible, and of what (if anything) is impossible. The savage, even more  than the civilised man, may be described as a creature \"moving about in  worlds not realised\". He feels, no less than civilised man, the need of  making the world intelligible, and he is active in his search for causes  and effects. There is much \"speculation in these eyes that he doth glare  withal\". This is a statement which has been denied by some persons  who have lived with savages. Thus Mr. Bates, in his Naturalist on the  Amazon,(1) writes: \"Their want of curiosity is extreme.... Vicente (an  Indian companion) did not know the cause of thunder and lightning. I  asked him who made the sun, the stars, the trees. He didn't know, and  had never heard the subject mentioned in his tribe.\" But Mr. Bates  admits that even Vicente had a theory of the configuration of the world.  \"The necessity of a theory of the earth and water had been felt, and  a theory had been suggested.\" Again, Mr. Bates says about a certain  Brazilian tribe, \"Their sluggish minds seem unable to conceive or feel  the want of a theory of the soul\"; and he thinks the cause of this  indolence is the lack \"of a written language or a leisured class\". Now  savages, as a rule, are all in the \"leisured class,\" all sportsmen.  Mr. Herbert Spencer, too, has expressed scepticism about the curiosity  attributed to savages. The point is important, because, in our view, the  medicine-man's powers are rooted in the savage theory of things, and if  the savage is too sluggish to invent or half consciously evolve a theory  of things, our hypothesis is baseless. Again, we expect to find in  savage myths the answer given by savages to their own questions. But  this view is impossible if savages do not ask themselves, and never have  asked themselves, any questions at all about the world. On this topic  Mr. Spencer writes: \"Along with absence of surprise there naturally  goes absence of intelligent curiosity\".(2) Yet Mr. Spencer admits that,  according to some witnesses, \"the Dyaks have an insatiable curiosity,\"  the Samoans \"are usually very inquisitive,\" and \"the Tahitians are  remarkably curious and inquisitive\". Nothing is more common than to  find travellers complaining that savages, in their ardently inquiring  curiosity, will not leave the European for a moment to his own  undisturbed devices. Mr. Spencer's savages, who showed no curiosity,  displayed this impassiveness when Europeans were trying to make them  exhibit signs of surprise. Impassivity is a point of honour with many  uncivilised races, and we cannot infer that a savage has no curiosity  because he does not excite himself over a mirror, or when his European  visitors try to swagger with their mechanical appliances. Mr. Herbert  Spencer founds, on the statements of Mr. Bates already quoted, a notion  that \"the savage, lacking ability to think and the accompanying desire  to know, is without tendency to speculate\". He backs Mr. Bates's  experience with Mungo Park's failure to \"draw\" the negroes about the  causes of day and night. They had never indulged a conjecture nor formed  an hypothesis on the matter. Yet Park avers that \"the belief in one God  is entire and universal among them\". This he \"pronounces without the  smallest shadow of doubt\". As to \"primitive man,\" according to Mr.  Spencer, \"the need for explanations about surrounding appearances does  not occur to him\". We have disclaimed all knowledge about \"primitive  man,\" but it is easy to show that Mr. Spencer grounds his belief in the  lack of speculation among savages on a frail foundation of evidence.      (1) Vol. ii. p. 162.    (2) Sociology, p. 98.      Mr. Spencer has admitted speculation, or at least curiosity, among New  Caledonians, New Guinea people, Dyaks, Samoans and Tahitians. Even where  he denies its existence, as among the Amazon tribes mentioned by Mr.  Bates, we happen to be able to show that Mr. Bates was misinformed.  Another traveller, the American geologist, Professor Hartt of Cornell  University, lived long among the tribes of the Amazon. But Professor  Hartt did not, like Mr. Bates, find them at all destitute of theories of  things--theories expressed in myths, and testifying to the intellectual  activity and curiosity which demands an answer to its questions.  Professor Hartt, when he first became acquainted with the Indians of the  Amazon, knew that they were well supplied with myths, and he set to work  to collect them. But he found that neither by coaxing nor by offers of  money could he persuade an Indian to relate a myth. Only by accident,  \"whi"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2833"],[0,"The Portrait of a Lady — Volume 1 (#20)"],[1,"a great deal of pleasure--more  perhaps than anything else, except the young ladies. His old house over  there--what does he call it, Lockleigh?--is very attractive; but I don't  think it's as pleasant as this. That doesn't matter, however--he has  so many others. His views don't hurt any one as far as I can see; they  certainly don't hurt himself. And if there were to be a revolution he  would come off very easily. They wouldn't touch him, they'd leave him as  he is: he's too much liked.\"    \"Ah, he couldn't be a martyr even if he wished!\" Isabel sighed. \"That's  a very poor position.\"    \"He'll never be a martyr unless you make him one,\" said the old man.    Isabel shook her head; there might have been something laughable in the  fact that she did it with a touch of melancholy. \"I shall never make any  one a martyr.\"    \"You'll never be one, I hope.\"    \"I hope not. But you don't pity Lord Warburton then as Ralph does?\"    Her uncle looked at her a while with genial acuteness. \"Yes, I do, after  all!\"        CHAPTER IX    The two Misses Molyneux, this nobleman's sisters, came presently to call  upon her, and Isabel took a fancy to the young ladies, who appeared to  her to show a most original stamp. It is true that when she described  them to her cousin by that term he declared that no epithet could be  less applicable than this to the two Misses Molyneux, since there  were fifty thousand young women in England who exactly resembled them.  Deprived of this advantage, however, Isabel's visitors retained that  of an extreme sweetness and shyness of demeanour, and of having, as  she thought, eyes like the balanced basins, the circles of \"ornamental  water,\" set, in parterres, among the geraniums.    \"They're not morbid, at any rate, whatever they are,\" our heroine said  to herself; and she deemed this a great charm, for two or three of the  friends of her girlhood had been regrettably open to the charge (they  would have been so nice without it), to say nothing of Isabel's having  occasionally suspected it as a tendency of her own. The Misses Molyneux  were not in their first youth, but they had bright, fresh complexions  and something of the smile of childhood. Yes, their eyes, which Isabel  admired, were round, quiet and contented, and their figures, also of a  generous roundness, were encased in sealskin jackets. Their friendliness  was great, so great that they were almost embarrassed to show it; they  seemed somewhat afraid of the young lady from the other side of the  world and rather looked than spoke their good wishes. But they made it  clear to her that they hoped she would come to luncheon at Lockleigh,  where they lived with their brother, and then they might see her very,  very often. They wondered if she wouldn't come over some day, and sleep:  they were expecting some people on the twenty-ninth, so perhaps she  would come while the people were there.    \"I'm afraid it isn't any one very remarkable,\" said the elder sister;  \"but I dare say you'll take us as you find us.\"    \"I shall find you delightful; I think you're enchanting just as you  are,\" replied Isabel, who often praised profusely.    Her visitors flushed, and her cousin told her, after they were gone,  that if she said such things to those poor girls they would think she  was in some wild, free manner practising on them: he was sure it was the  first time they had been called enchanting.    \"I can't help it,\" Isabel answered. \"I think it's lovely to be so quiet  and reasonable and satisfied. I should like to be like that.\"    \"Heaven forbid!\" cried Ralph with ardour.    \"I mean to try and imitate them,\" said Isabel. \"I want very much to see  them at home.\"    She had this pleasure a few days later, when, with Ralph and his mother,  she drove over to Lockleigh. She found the Misses Molyneux sitting in a  vast drawing-room (she perceived afterwards it was one of several) in a  wilderness of faded chintz; they were dressed on this occasion in black  velveteen. Isabel liked them even better at home than she had done at  Gardencourt, and was more than ever struck with the fact that they were  not morbid. It had seemed to her before that if they had a fault it was  a want of play of mind; but she presently saw they were capable of deep  emotion. Before luncheon she was alone with them for some time, on one  side of the room, while Lord Warburton, at a distance, talked to Mrs.  Touchett.    \"Is it true your brother's such a great radical?\" Isabel asked. She  knew it was true, but we have seen that her interest in human nature was  keen, and she had a desire to draw the Misses Molyneux out.    \"Oh dear, yes; he's immensely advanced,\" said Mildred, the younger  sister.    \"At the same time Warburton's very reasonable,\" Miss Molyneux observed.    Isabel watched him a moment at the other side of the room; he was  clearly trying hard to make himself agreeable to Mrs. Touchett. Ralph  had met the frank advances of one of the dogs before the fire that the  temperature of an English August, in the ancient expanses, had not  made an impertinence. \"Do you suppose your brother's sincere?\" Isabel  enquired with a smile.    \"Oh, he must be, you know!\" Mildred exclaimed quickly, while the elder  sister gazed at our heroine in silence.    \"Do you think he would stand the test?\"    \"The test?\"    \"I mean for instance having to give up all this.\"    \"Having to give up Lockleigh?\" said Miss Molyneux, finding her voice.    \"Yes, and the other places; what are they called?\"    The two sisters exchanged an almost frightened glance. \"Do you mean--do  you mean on account of the expense?\" the younger one asked.    \"I dare say he might let one or two of his houses,\" said the other.    \"Let them for nothing?\" Isabel demanded.    \"I can't fancy his giving up his property,\" said Miss Molyneux.    \"Ah, I'm afraid he is an impostor!\" Isabel returned. \"Don't you think  it's a false position?\"    Her companions, evidently, had lost themselves. \"My brother's position?\"  Miss Molyneux enquired.    \"It's thought a very good position,\" said the younger sister. \"It's the  first position in this part of the county.\"    \"I dare say you think me very irreverent,\" Isabel took occasion to  remark. \"I suppose you revere your brother and are rather afraid of  him.\"    \"Of course one looks up to one's brother,\" said Miss Molyneux simply.    \"If you do that he must be very good--because you, evidently, are  beautifully good.\"    \"He's most kind. It will never be known, the good he does.\"    \"His ability is known,\" Mildred added; \"every one thinks it's immense.\"    \"Oh, I can see that,\" said Isabel. \"But if I were he I should wish to  fight to the death: I mean for the heritage of the past. I should hold  it tight.\"    \"I think one ought to be liberal,\" Mildred argued gently. \"We've always  been so, even from the earliest times.\"    \"Ah well,\" said Isabel, \"you've made a great success of it; I don't  wonder you like it. I see you're very fond of crewels.\"    When Lord Warburton showed her the house, after luncheon, it seemed to  her a matter of course that it should be a noble picture. Within, it  had been a good deal modernised--some of its best points had lost their  purity; but as they saw it from the gardens, a stout grey pile, of the  softest, deepest, most weather-fretted hue, rising from a broad, still  moat, it affected the young visitor as a castle in a legend. The day was  cool and rather lustreless; the first note of autumn had been struck,  and the watery sunshine rested on the walls in blurred and desultory  gleams, washing them, as it were, in places tenderly chosen, where the  ache of antiquity was keenest. Her host's brother, the Vicar, had come  to luncheon, and Isabel had had five minutes' talk with him--time enough  to institute a search for a rich ecclesiasticism and give it up as  vain. The marks of the Vicar of Lockleigh were a big, athletic figure,  a candid, natural countenance, a capacious appetite and a tendency to  indiscriminate laughter. Isabel learned afterwards from her cousin  that before taking orders he had been a mighty wrestler and that he  was still, on occasion--in the privacy of the family circle as it  were--quite capable of flooring his man. Isabel liked him--she was in  the mood for liking everything; but her imagination was a good deal  taxed to think of him as a source of spiritual aid. The whole party, on  leaving lunch, went to walk in the grounds; but Lord Warburton exercised  some ingenuity in engaging his least familiar guest in a stroll apart  from the others.    \"I wish you to see the place properly, seriously,\" he said. \"You can't  do so if your attention is distracted by irrelevant gossip.\" His own  conversation (though he told Isabel a good deal about the house, which  had a very curious history) was not purely archaeological; he reverted  at intervals to matters more personal--matters personal to the young  lady as well as to himself. But at last, after a pause of some duration,  returning for a moment to their ostensible theme, \"Ah, well,\" he said,  \"I'm very glad indeed you like the old barrack. I wish you could see  more of it--that you could stay here a while. My sisters have taken an  immense fancy to you--if that would be any inducement.\"    \"There's no want of inducements,\" Isabel answered; \"but I'm afraid I  can't make engagements. I'm quite in my aunt's hands.\"    \"Ah, pardon me if I say I don't exactly believe that. I'm pretty sure  you can do whatever you want.\"    \"I'm sorry if I make that impression on you; I don't think it's a nice  impression to make.\"    \"It has the merit of permitting me to hope.\" And Lord Warburton paused a  moment.    \"To hope what?\"    \"That in future I may see you often.\"    \"Ah,\" said Isabel, \"to enjoy that pleasure I needn't be so terribly  emancipated.\"    \"Doubtless not; and yet, at the same time, I don't think your uncle  likes me.\"    \"You're very much mistaken. I've heard him speak"]]]
