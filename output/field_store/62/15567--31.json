A boys' school of a special kind is the Panjab  Chiefs' College at Lahore, intended for the sons of princes and men of  high social position.    ~Technical Schools.~--In an agricultural country like the Panjab there is  not at present any large field for technical schools. The best are the  Mayo School of Art and the Railway Technical School at Lahore. The  latter is successful because its pupils can readily find employment in  the railway workshops. Mr Kipling, the father of the poet, when  principal of the former, did much for art teaching, and the present  principal, Bhai Ram Singh, is a true artist. The Government Engineering  School has recently been remodelled and removed to Rasul, where the  head-works of the Lower Jhelam canal are situated.    [Illustration: Fig. 42. A School in the time preceding annexation.    (_From a picture book said to have been prepared for the Maharaja Dalip  Singh._)]    ~Female Education.~--Female education is still a tender plant, but of late  growth has been vigorous. The Victoria May School in Lahore founded in  1908 has developed into the Queen Mary College, which provides an  excellent education for girls of what may be called the upper middle  class. There is a separate class for married ladies. Hitherto they have  only been reached by the teaching given in their own homes by missionary  ladies, whose useful work is now being imitated by the Hindu community  in Lahore. There is an excellent Hindu Girls' Boarding School in  Jalandhar. The Sikhs and the body of reformers known as the Dev Samaj  have good girls' schools at Ferozepore. The best mission schools are the  Kinnaird High School at Lahore and the Alexandra School at Amritsar. The  North India School of Medicine for Women at Ludhiana, also a missionary  institution, does admirable work. In the case of elementary schools the  difficulty of getting qualified teachers is even greater than as regards  boys' schools.    ~Education of European Children.~--There are special arrangements for the  education of European and Anglo-Indian children. In this department the  Roman Catholics have been active and successful. The best schools are  the Lawrence Asylum at Sanawar, Bishop Cotton's School, Auckland House,  and St Bede's at Simla, St Denys', the Lawrence Asylum, and the Convent  School at Murree.    ~The Panjab University.~--The Panjab University was constituted in 1882,  but the Government Arts College and Oriental College, the Medical  College and the Law School at Lahore, which are affiliated with it, are  of older date. The University is an examining body like London  University. Besides the two Arts Colleges under Government management  mentioned above there are nine private Arts Colleges aided by Government  grants and affiliated to the University. Four of these are in Lahore,  two, the Dayanand Anglo-Vedic and the Dial Singh Colleges, are Hindu  institutions, one, the Islamia College, is Muhammadan, the fourth is the  popular and efficient Forman Christian College. Four out of five art  students read in Lahore. Of the Arts colleges outside Lahore the most  important is the St Stephen's College at Delhi. The Khalsa School and  College at Amritsar is a Sikh institution. The Veterinary College at  Lahore is the best of its kind in India, and the Agricultural College at  Lyallpur is a well-equipped institution, which at present attracts few  pupils, but may play a very useful role in the future. There is little  force in the reproach that we built up a super-structure of higher  education before laying a broad foundation of primary education. There  is more in the charge that the higher educational food we have offered  has not been well adapted to the intellectual digestions of the  recipients.    ~Education in N.W.F. Province, Native States, and I Kashmir.~--The Panjab  Native States and Kashmir are much more backward as regards education  than the British Province. As is natural in a tract in which the  population is overwhelmingly Musalman by religion and farming by trade  the N.W.F. Province lags behind the Panjab. Six colleges in the States  and the N.W.F. Province are affiliated to the Panjab University.          CHAPTER XII    ROADS AND RAILWAYS      ~Roads.~--The alignment of good roads in the plains of the Panjab is easy,  and the deposits of calcareous nodules or _kankar_ often found near the  surface furnish good metalling material. In the west the rainfall is so  scanty and in many parts wheeled traffic so rare that it is often wise  to leave the roads unmetalled. There are in the Panjab over 2000 miles  of metalled, and above 20,000 miles of unmetalled roads. The greatest  highway in the world, the Grand Trunk, which starts from Calcutta and  ends at Peshawar, passes through the province from Delhi in the  south-east to Attock in the extreme north-west corner, and there crosses  the Indus and enters the N.W.F. Province. The greater part of the  section from Karnal to Lahore had been completed some years before the  Mutiny, that from Lahore to Peshawar was finished in 1863-64. A great  loop road connects our arsenal at Ferozepore with the Grand Trunk Road  at Lahore and Ludhiana. The fine metalled roads from Ambala to Kalka,  and Kalka to Simla have lost much of their importance since the railway  was brought to the hill capital. Beyond Simla the Kalka-Simla road is  carried on for 150 miles to the Shipki Pass on the borders of Tibet,  being maintained as a very excellent hill road adapted to mule carriage.  A fine tonga road partly in the plains and partly in the hills joins  Murree with Rawalpindi. From Murree it drops into the Jhelam valley  crossing the river and entering Kashmir at Kohala. It is carried up the  gorge of the Jhelam to Baramula and thence through the Kashmir valley to  Srinagar. A motor-car can be driven all the way from Rawalpindi to  Srinagar. In the N.W.F. Province a great metalled road connects  Peshawar, Kohat, Bannu, and Dera Ismail Khan.    [Illustration: Fig. 43. Poplar lined road to Srinagar.]    ~Railways. Main Lines.~--It is just over fifty years since the first  railway, a short line joining Lahore and Amritsar, was opened in 1862.  Three years later Lahore was linked up with Multan and the small  steamers which then plied on the Indus. Amritsar was connected with  Delhi in 1870, and Lahore with Peshawar in 1883. The line from Peshawar  to Lahore, and branching thence to Karachi and Delhi may be considered  the Trunk Line. The railway service has been enormously developed in the  past thirty years. In 1912 there were over 4000 miles of open lines.  There are now three routes from Delhi to Lahore:    [Illustration: Fig. 44. Map showing railways.]    (_a_) The N.W. Railway _via_ Meerut and Saharanpur (on east of Jamna),  and Ambala, Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Amritsar;    (_b_) The Southern Panjab Railway _via_ Jind, Rohtak, Bhatinda, and  Ferozepore;    (_c_) The Delhi-Ambala-Kalka branch of the East Indian Rallway from  Delhi through Karnal to Ambala, and thence by the N.W. Railway. This is  the shortest route.    The Southern Panjab Railway also connects Delhi with Karachi through its  junction with the N.W. Railway at Samasata to the south of Bahawalpur.  Another route is by a line passing through Rewari and the Merta  junction. Karachi is the natural seaport of the central and western  Panjab. The S.P. Railway now gives an easy connection with Ferozepore  and Ludhiana, and the enormous export of wheat, cotton, etc. from the  new canal colonies is carried by several lines which converge at  Khanewal, a junction on the main line, a little north of Multan.    ~Railways. Minor Lines.~--The Sind Sagar branch starting from Lala Musa  between Lahore and Amritsar with smaller lines taking off further north  at Golra and Campbellpur serves the part of the province lying north of  the Salt Range. These lines converge at Kundian in the Mianwali  district, and a single line runs thence southwards to points on the  Indus opposite Dera Ismail Khan and Dera Ghazi Khan, and turning  eastwards rejoins the trunk line at Sher Shah near Multan. There are a  number of branch lines in the plains, some owned by native States.  Strategically a very important one is that which crossing the Indus by  the Khushalgarh bridge unites Rawalpindi with Kohat. The only hill  railway is that from Kalka to Simla. A second is now under construction  which, when completed, will connect Rawalpindi with Srinagar. All these  lines with the exception of the branch of the E.I. Railway mentioned  above are worked by the staff of the N. W. State Railway, whose manager  controls inside and outside the Panjab some 5000 miles of open line. The  interest earned in 1912 was 4-1/2 p.c., a good return when it is  considered that the parts of the system to the north of the Salt Range  and the Sind Sagar railway were built primarily for strategic reasons.          CHAPTER XIII    CANALS      ~Importance of Canals.~--One need have no hesitation in placing among the  greatest achievements of British rule in the Panjab the magnificent  system of irrigation canals which it has given to the province. Its  great alluvial plain traversed by large rivers drawing an unfailing  supply of water from the Himalayan snows affords an ideal field for the  labours of the canal engineer. The vastness of the arid areas which  without irrigation yield no crops at all or only cheap millets and  pulses makes his works of inestimable benefit to the people and a source  of revenue to the State.    ~Canals before annexation.~--In the west of the province we found in  existence small inundation canals dug by the people with some help from  their rulers. These only ran during the monsoon season, when the rivers  were swollen. In 1626 Shahjahan's Persian engineer, Ali Mardan Khan,  brought to Delhi the water of the canal "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24583"],[0,"Langstroth on the Hive and the Honey-Bee: A Bee Keeper's Manual (#20)"],[1," and on a large scale, the  merits of this hive, that I might not deceive both myself and others,  and add another to the many useless contrivances which have deluded and  disgusted a credulous public. I would, however, most earnestly repudiate  all claims to having devised a \"perfect bee-hive.\" Perfection can belong  only to the works of the great Creator, to whose Omniscient eye, all  causes and effects with all their relations, were present, when he  spake, and from nothing formed the universe and all its glorious  wonders. For man to stamp upon any of his own works, the label of  perfection, is to show both his folly and presumption.    It must be confessed that the culture of bees is at a very low ebb in  our country, when thousands can be induced to purchase hives which are  in most glaring opposition not only to the true principles of Apiarian  knowledge, but often, to the plainest dictates of simple common sense.  Such have been the losses and disappointments of deluded purchasers,  that it is no wonder that they turn from everything offered in the shape  of a patent bee-hive, as a miserable humbug, if not a most bare-faced  cheat.    I do not hesitate to say that those old-fashioned bee-keepers, who have  most steadily refused to meddle with any novelties, and who have used  hives of the very simplest construction, or at least such as are only  one remove from the old straw hive, or wooden box, have, as a general  thing, realized by far the largest profits in the management of bees.  They have lost neither time, money nor bees, in the vain hope of  obtaining any unusual results from hives, which, in the very nature of  the case, can secure nothing really in advance of what can be  accomplished by a simple box-hive with an upper chamber.    _A hive of the simplest possible construction_, is only a close  imitation of the abode of bees in a state of nature; being a mere hollow  receptacle in which they are protected from the weather, and where they  can lay up their stores.    _An improved hive_ is one which contains, in addition, a separate  apartment in which the bees can be induced to lay up the surplus portion  of their stores, for the use of their owner. All the various hives in  common use, are only modifications of this latter hive, and, as a  general rule, they are bad, exactly in proportion as they depart from  it. Not one of them offers any remedy for the loss of the queen, or  indeed for most of the casualties to which bees are exposed: they form  no reliable basis for any new system of management; and hence the  cultivation of bees, is substantially where it was, fifty years ago, and  the Apiarian as entirely dependent as ever, upon all the whims and  caprices of an insect which may be made completely subject to his  control.    No hive which does not furnish a thorough control over every comb, can  be considered as any substantial advance on the simple improved or  chamber hive. Of all such hives, the one which with the least expense,  gives the greatest amount of protection, and the readiest access to the  spare honey boxes, is the best.    Having thus enumerated the tests to which all hives ought to be  subjected, and by which they should stand or fall, I submit them to the  candid examination of practical, common sense bee-keepers, who have had  the largest experience in the management of bees, and are most  conversant with the evils of the present system; and who are therefore  best fitted to apply them to an invention, which, if I may be pardoned  for using the enthusiastic language of an experienced Apiarian on  examining its practical workings, \"introduces, not simply an  _improvement_, but a _revolution_ in bee-keeping.\"    FOOTNOTES:    [12] A writer in the New England Farmer for March, 1853, estimates that  the mild winter has been worth in the saving of fodder to the farmers of  New Hampshire alone, two and a half millions of dollars! By suitable  arrangements, bees even in the very coldest climates can have all the  advantages of a mild winter.          CHAPTER VIII.    PROTECTION AGAINST EXTREMES OF HEAT AND COLD, SUDDEN AND SEVERE CHANGES  OF TEMPERATURE, AND DAMPNESS IN THE HIVES.      I specially invite a careful perusal of this chapter, as the subject,  though of the very first importance in the management of bees, is one to  which but little attention has been given by the majority of  cultivators.    In our climate of great and sudden extremes, many colonies are annually  injured or destroyed by undue exposure to heat or cold. In Summer, thin  hives are often exposed to the direct heat of the sun, so that the combs  melt, and the bees are drowned in their own sweets. Even if they escape  utter ruin, they cannot work to advantage in the almost suffocating heat  of their hives.    But in those places where the Winters are both long and severe, it is  much more difficult to protect the bees from the cold than from the  heat. Bees are not, as some suppose, in a _dormant_, or _torpid_  condition in Winter. It must be remembered that they were intended to  live in colonies, in Winter, as well as Summer. The wasp, hornet, and  other insects which do not live in families in the Winter, lay up no  stores for cold weather, and are so organized as to be able to endure in  a torpid state, a very low temperature; so low that it would be certain  death to a honey-bee, which when frozen, is as surely killed as a frozen  man.    As soon as the temperature of the hives falls too low for their comfort,  the bees gather themselves into a more compact body, to preserve to the  utmost, their animal heat; and if the cold becomes so great that this  will not suffice, they keep up an incessant, tremulous motion,  accompanied by a loud humming noise; in other words, they take active  exercise in order to keep warm! If a thermometer is pushed up among  them, it will indicate a high temperature, even when the external  atmosphere is many degrees below zero. When the bees are unable to  maintain the necessary amount of animal heat, an occurrence which is  very common with small colonies in badly protected hives, then, as a  matter of course, they must perish.    Extreme cold, when of long continuance, very frequently destroys  colonies in thin hives, even when they are strong both in bees and  honey. The inside of such hives, is often filled with frost, and the  bees, after eating all the food in the combs in which they are  clustered, are unable to enter the frosty combs, and thus starve in the  midst of plenty. The unskilfull bee-keeper who finds an abundance of  honey in the hives, cannot conjecture the cause of their death.    If the cold merely destroyed feeble colonies, or strong ones only now  and then, it would not be so formidable an enemy; but every year, it  causes many of the most flourishing stocks to perish by starvation. The  extra quantity of food which they are compelled to eat, in order to keep  up their heat in their miserable hives, is often the turning point with  them, between life and death. They starve, when with proper protection,  they would have had food enough and to spare.    But some one may say, \"What possible difference can the kind of hives in  which bees are kept make in the quantity of food which they will  consume?\" Enough, I would reply, in some single winters, to pay the  difference between a good hive and a bad one!    I cannot move my finger, or wink my eye-lids without some waste of  muscle, however small; for it is a well-ascertained law in our animal  economy, that all _muscular exertion_ is attended with a corresponding  _waste_ of muscular fibre. Now this waste must be supplied by the  consumption of food, and it would be as unreasonable to expect constant  heat from a stove without fresh supplies of fuel, as incessant muscular  activity from an insect, without a supply of food proportioned to that  activity. If then we can contrive any way to keep our bees in almost  perfect quiet during the Winter, we may be certain that they will need  much less food than when they are constantly excited.    In the cold Winter of 1851-2, I kept two swarms in a perfectly dry and  dark cellar, where the temperature was remarkably uniform, seldom  varying two degrees from 50 deg. of Fahrenheit; and I found that the bees  ate very little honey. The hives were of glass, and the bees, when  examined from time to time, were found clustered in almost death-like  repose. If these bees had been exposed in thin hives in the open air,  they would, in all probability, have eaten four times as much; for  whenever the sun shone upon them, or the atmosphere was unusually warm,  they would have been roused to injurious activity, and the same would  have been the case, when the cold was severe. Exposed to sudden changes  and severe cold, they would have been in almost perpetual motion, and  must have been compelled to consume a largely increased quantity of  food. In this way, many colonies are annually starved to death, which if  they had been better protected, would have survived to gladden their  owner with an abundant harvest. This protection, as a general thing,  must be given to them in the open air, for it is a very rare thing, to  meet with a cellar which is dry enough to prevent the combs from  moulding, and the bees from becoming diseased.    Bees never, unless diseased, discharge their faeces in the hive; and the  want of suitable protection, by exciting undue activity, and compelling  them to eat more freely, causes their bodies to be greatly distended  with accumulated faeces. On the return of warm weather, bees in this  condition being often too feeble to fly, crawl from their hives, and  miserably perish.    I must notice another exceedingly injurious effect of insufficient  protection, in causing the _moisture_ to settle upon the cold top and  sides of the interior of the hive, from whence it drips upon the bees.  In this way, many of their number are chilled"]]]
