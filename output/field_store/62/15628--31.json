Metallic injections, partial cold bath, internal method as in the  fluor albus above described. Balsam of copaiva. Tincture of cantharides.    9. _Hepatis tumor._ The liver becomes enlarged from defect of the  absorption of mucus from its cells, as in anasarca, especially in feeble  children; at the same time less bile is secreted from the torpid  circulation in the vena portae. And as the absorbents, which resume the  thinner parts of the bile from the gall-bladder and hepatic ducts, are also  torpid or quiescent, the bile is more dilute, as well as in less quantity.  From the obstruction of the passage of the blood through the compressed  vena porta these patients have tumid bellies, and pale bloated  countenances; their paleness is probably owing to the deficiency of the  quantity of red globules in the blood in consequence of the inert state of  the bile.    These symptoms in children are generally attended with worms, the dilute  bile and the weak digestion not destroying them. In sleep I have seen  fleuke-worms in the gall-ducts themselves among the dilute bile; which  gall-ducts they eat through, and then produce ulcers, and the hectic fever,  called the rot. See Class I. 1. 4. 10. and Article IV. 2. 6.    M. M. After a calomel purge, crude iron-filings are specific in this  disease in children, and the worms are destroyed by the returning acrimony  and quantity of the bile. A blister on the region of the liver. Sorbentia,  as worm-seed, santonicum. Columbo. Bark.    10. _Chlorosis._ When the defect of the due action of both the absorbent  and secerning vessels of the liver affects women, and is attended with  obstruction of the catamenia, it is called chlorosis; and is cured by the  exhibition of steel, which restores by its specific stimulus the absorbent  power of the liver; and the menstruation, which was obstructed in  consequence of debility, recurs.    Indigestion, owing to torpor of the stomach, and a consequent too great  acidity of its contents, attend this disease; whence a desire of eating  chalk, or marl. Sometimes a great quantity of pale urine is discharged in a  morning, which is owing to the inaction of the absorbents, which are  distributed on the neck of the bladder, during sleep. The swelling of the  ankles, which frequently attends chlorosis, is another effect of deficient  action of the absorbent system; and the pale countenance is occasioned by  the deficient quantity of red globules of blood, caused by the deficient  quantity or acrimony of the bile, and consequent weakness of the  circulation. The pulse is so quick in some cases of chlorosis, that, when  attended with an accidental cough, it may be mistaken for pulmonary  consumption. This quick pulse is owing to the debility of the heart from  the want of stimulus occasioned by the deficiency of the quantity, and  acrimony of the blood.    M. M. Steel. Bitters. Constant moderate exercise. Friction with flannel all  over the body and limbs night and morning. Rhubarb five grains, opium half  a grain, every night. Flesh diet, with small beer, or wine and water. The  disease continues some months, but at length subsides by the treatment  above described. A bath of about eighty degrees, as Buxton Bath, is of  service; a colder bath may do great injury.    11. _Hydrocele._ Dropsy of the vagina testis. Dropsies have been divided  into the incysted and the diffused, meaning those of the cellular membrane,  the cells of which communicate with each other like a sponge, and those of  any other cavity of the body. The collections of mucous fluids in the  various cells and cavities of the body arise from the torpor of the  absorbent vessels of those parts. It is probable, that in dropsies attended  with great thirst the cutaneous absorbents become paralytic first; and then  from the great thirst, which is thus occasioned by the want of atmospheric  moisture, the absorption of the fat ensues; as in fevers attended with  great thirst, the fat is quickly taken up. See Obesitas I. 2. 3. 17. Some  have believed, that the cellular and adipose membranes are different ones;  as no fat is ever deposited in the eye-lids or scrotum, both which places  are very liable to be distended with the mucilaginous fluid of the  anasarca, and with air in Emphysema. Sometimes a gradual absorption of the  accumulated fluid takes place, and the thinner parts being taken up, there  remains a more viscid fluid, or almost a solid in the part, as in some  swelled legs, which can not easily be indented by the pressure of the  finger, and are called scorbutic. Sometimes the paralysis of the absorbents  is completely removed, and the whole is again taken up into the  circulation.    The Hydrocele is known by a tumor of the scrotum, which is without pain,  gradually produced, with fluctuation, and a degree of pellucidity, when a  candle is held behind it; it is the most simple incysted dropsy, as it is  not in general complicated with other diseases, as ascites with schirrous  liver, and hydrocephalus internus, with general debility. The cure of this  disease is effected by different ways; it consists in discharging the water  by an external aperture; and by so far inflaming the cyst and testicle,  that they afterwards grow together, and thus prevent in future any  secretion or effusion of mucus; the disease is thus cured, not by the  revivescence of the absorbent power of the lymphatics, but by the  prevention of secretion by the adhesion of the vagina to the testis. This I  believe is performed with less pain, and is more certainly manageable by  tapping, or discharging the fluid by means of a trocar, and after the  evacuation of it to fill the cyst with a mixture of wine and water for a  few minutes till the necessary degree of stimulus is produced, and then to  withdraw it; as recommended by Mr. Earle. See also Medical Commentaries by  Dr. Duncan, for 1793.    12. _Hydrocephalus internus_, or dropsy of the ventricles of the brain, is  fatal to many children, and some adults. When this disease is less in  quantity, it probably produces a fever, termed a nervous fever, and which  is sometimes called a worm fever, according to the opinion of Dr.  Gilchrist, in the Scots Medical essays. This fever is attended with great  inirritability, as appears from the dilated pupils of the eyes, in which it  corresponds with the dropsy of the brain. And the latter disease has its  paroxysms of quick pulse, and in that respect corresponds with other fevers  with inirritability.    The hydrocephalus internus is distinguished from apoplexy by its being  attended with fever, and from nervous fever by the paroxysms being very  irregular, with perfect intermissions many times in a day. In nervous fever  the pain of the head generally affects the middle of the forehead; in  hydrocephalus internus it is generally on one side of the head. One of the  earliest criterions is the patient being uneasy on raising his head from  the pillow, and wishing to lie down again immediately; which I suppose is  owing to the pressure of the water on the larger trunks of the  blood-vessels entering the cavity being more intolerable than on the  smaller ones; for if the larger trunks are compressed, it must  inconvenience the branches also; but if some of the small branches are  compressed only, the trunks are not so immediately incommoded.    Blisters on the head, and mercurial ointment externally, with calomel  internally, are principally recommended in this fatal disease. When the  patient cannot bear to be raised up in bed without great uneasiness, it is  a bad symptom. So I believe is deafness, which is commonly mistaken for  stupor. See Class I. 2. 5. 6. And when the dilatation of the pupil of  either eye, or the squinting is very apparent, or the pupils of both eyes  much dilated, it is generally fatal. As by stimulating one branch of  lymphatics into inverted motion, another branch is liable to absorb its  fluid more hastily; suppose strong errhines, as common tobacco snuff to  children, or one grain of turpeth mineral, (Hydrargyrus vitriolatus), mixed  with ten or fifteen grains of sugar, was gradually blown up the nostrils?  See Class I. 3. 2. 1. I have tried common snuff upon two children in this  disease; one could not be made to sneeze, and the other was too near death  to receive advantage. When the mercurial preparations have produced  salivation, I believe they may have been of service, but I doubt their good  effect otherwise. In one child I tried the tincture of Digitalis; but it  was given with too timid a hand, and too late in the disease, to determine  its effects. See Sect. XXIX. 5. 9.    As all the above remedies generally fail of success, I think frequent,  almost hourly, shocks of electricity from very small charges might be  passed through the head in all directions with probability of good event.  And the use of the trephine, where the affected side can be distinguished.  See Strabismus, Class I. 2. 5. 4. When one eye is affected, does the  disease exist in the ventricule of that side?    13. _Ascites._ The dropsy of the cavity of the abdomen is known by a tense  swelling of the belly; which does not sound on being struck like the  tympany; and in which a fluctuation can be readily perceived by applying  one hand expanded on one side, and striking the tumour on the other.    Effusions of water into large cavities, as into that of the abdomen or  thorax, or into the ventricules of the brain or pericardium, are more  difficult to be reabsorbed, than the effusion of fluids into the cellular  membrane; because one part of this extensive sponge-like system of cells,  which connects all the solid parts of the body, may have its power of  absorption impaired, at the same time that some other part of it may still  retain that power, or perhaps possess it in an increased degree; and as all  these cells communicate with each other, the fluid, which abounds in one  part "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27638"],[0,"The 2001 CIA World Factbook (#20)"],[1,"name: conventional long form:  none    conventional short form:  Antarctica    Government type: Antarctic Treaty Summary - the Antarctic Treaty,  signed on 1 December 1959 and entered into force on 23 June 1961,  establishes the legal framework for the management of Antarctica.  The 23rd Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting was held in Peru in  May 1999. At the end of 2000, there were 44 treaty member nations:  27 consultative and 17 non-consultative. Consultative (voting)  members include the seven nations that claim portions of Antarctica  as national territory (some claims overlap) and 20 nonclaimant  nations. The US and Russia have reserved the right to make claims.  The US does not recognize the claims of others. Antarctica is  administered through meetings of the consultative member nations.  Decisions from these meetings are carried out by these member  nations (within their areas) in accordance with their own national  laws. The year in parentheses indicates when an acceding nation was  voted to full consultative (voting) status, while no date indicates  the country was an original 1959 treaty signatory. Claimant nations  are - Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, New Zealand, Norway, and  the UK. Nonclaimant consultative nations are - Belgium, Brazil  (1983), Bulgaria (1998) China (1985), Ecuador (1990), Finland  (1989), Germany (1981), India (1983), Italy (1987), Japan, South  Korea (1989), Netherlands (1990), Peru (1989), Poland (1977),  Russia, South Africa, Spain (1988), Sweden (1988), Uruguay (1985),  and the US. Non-consultative (nonvoting) members, with year of  accession in parentheses, are - Austria (1987), Canada (1988),  Colombia (1989), Cuba (1984), Czech Republic (1993), Denmark (1965),  Greece (1987), Guatemala (1991), Hungary (1984), North Korea (1987),  Papua New Guinea (1981), Romania (1971), Slovakia (1993),  Switzerland (1990), Turkey (1995), Ukraine (1992), and Venezuela  (1999). Article 1 - area to be used for peaceful purposes only;  military activity, such as weapons testing, is prohibited, but  military personnel and equipment may be used for scientific research  or any other peaceful purpose; Article 2 - freedom of scientific  investigation and cooperation shall continue; Article 3 - free  exchange of information and personnel, cooperation with the UN and  other international agencies; Article 4 - does not recognize,  dispute, or establish territorial claims and no new claims shall be  asserted while the treaty is in force; Article 5 - prohibits nuclear  explosions or disposal of radioactive wastes; Article 6 - includes  under the treaty all land and ice shelves south of 60 degrees 00  minutes south and reserves high seas rights; Article 7 -  treaty-state observers have free access, including aerial  observation, to any area and may inspect all stations,  installations, and equipment; advance notice of all expeditions and  of the introduction of military personnel must be given; Article 8 -  allows for jurisdiction over observers and scientists by their own  states; Article 9 - frequent consultative meetings take place among  member nations; Article 10 - treaty states will discourage  activities by any country in Antarctica that are contrary to the  treaty; Article 11 - disputes to be settled peacefully by the  parties concerned or, ultimately, by the ICJ; Articles 12, 13, 14 -  deal with upholding, interpreting, and amending the treaty among  involved nations. Other agreements - some 200 recommendations  adopted at treaty consultative meetings and ratified by governments  include - Agreed Measures for Fauna and Flora (1964) which were  later incorporated into the Environmental Protocol; Convention for  the Conservation of Antarctic Seals (1972); Convention on the  Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (1980); a mineral  resources agreement was signed in 1988 but remains unratified; the  Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty was  signed 4 October 1991 and entered into force 14 January 1998; this  agreement provides for the protection of the Antarctic environment  through five specific annexes: 1) marine pollution, 2) fauna and  flora, 3) environmental impact assessments, 4) waste management, and  5) protected area management; it prohibits all activities relating  to mineral resources except scientific research.    Legal system: Antarctica is administered through meetings of the  consultative member nations. Decisions from these meetings are  carried out by these member nations (within their areas) in  accordance with their own national laws. US law, including certain  criminal offenses by or against US nationals, such as murder, may  apply extra-territorially. Some US laws directly apply to  Antarctica. For example, the Antarctic Conservation Act, 16 U.S.C.  section 2401 et seq., provides civil and criminal penalties for the  following activities, unless authorized by regulation of statute:  the taking of native mammals or birds; the introduction of  nonindigenous plants and animals; entry into specially protected  areas; the discharge or disposal of pollutants; and the importation  into the US of certain items from Antarctica. Violation of the  Antarctic Conservation Act carries penalties of up to $10,000 in  fines and one year in prison. The National Science Foundation and  Department of Justice share enforcement responsibilities. Public Law  95-541, the US Antarctic Conservation Act of 1978, as amended in  1996, requires expeditions from the US to Antarctica to notify, in  advance, the Office of Oceans and Polar Affairs, Room 5801,  Department of State, Washington, DC 20520, which reports such plans  to other nations as required by the Antarctic Treaty.

Antarctica    Economy    Economy - overview: Fishing off the coast and tourism, both based  abroad, account for the limited economic activity. Antarctic  fisheries in 1998-99 (1 July-30 June) reported landing 119,898  metric tons. Unregulated fishing landed five to six times more than  the regulated fishery, and allegedly illegal fishing in antarctic  waters in 1998 resulted in the seizure (by France and Australia) of  at least eight fishing ships. Companies interested in commercial  fishing activities in Antarctica have put forward proposals. The  Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources  determines the recommended catch limits for marine species. A total  of 13,193 tourists visited in the 1999-2000 summer, up from the  10,013 who visited the previous year. Nearly all of them were  passengers on 24 commercial (nongovernmental) ships and several  yachts that made 143 trips during the summer. Most tourist trips  lasted approximately two weeks.
