I think I can take care of myself.\"          CHAPTER XVI    OFF FOR THE ENCAMPMENT      As was the usual custom at Colby Hall, all of the old officers and  those newly elected were invited to participate in a dinner given by  Captain Dale. This was held in a private dining room of the school,  and was usually a function looked forward to with much pleasure by  those to take part.    \"Now we've got to look our prettiest,\" announced Fred to Jack. \"Of  course, we'll wear our new officers' uniforms.\"    The dinner proved to be one long to be remembered by the two Rover  boys, and they were sorry to think the twins had not been present to  see what took place. There were some speeches and a good deal of  merrymaking, and the two Rovers were congratulated over and over again  on having been elected.    \"I'm mighty glad to think you're going to be at the head of Company C,  Captain Rover,\" said Major Ralph Mason. \"And glad, too, that your  cousin Fred is going to be a lieutenant of that company. I shall  expect great things from both of you.\"    \"Well, I intend to do the best I can,\" announced Jack modestly.    There was but one drawback to the affair. Gabe Werner did not show  himself, nor did he send any letter of regret to Captain Dale.    \"Gabe is sore, all right enough,\" declared one of the under officers.  \"When I asked him if he was coming to the spread, he merely shook his  head and looked like a thundercloud.\"    Sunday proved rather a busy day for all of the cadets, yet the Rovers,  along with a number of others, went to Haven Point where they met some  of the girls. All attended services at one of the local churches. Then  the young folks paired off, the boys walking with the girls to  Clearwater Hall.    \"Oh, Jack, you can't think how proud I am to know they have made you a  captain!\" said Ruth, who was walking beside the newly-elected officer.  \"And I think you ought to be very proud yourself.\"    \"I admit it makes me feel pretty good, Ruth,\" he answered.    \"But you'll have to be careful,\" went on the girl anxiously. \"Randy  told me on the way to church that a cadet named Werner is very angry  because you cut him out of one of the captaincies.\"    \"I'm not afraid of Werner or any of his crowd!\"    \"Yes, but he may try to make trouble, Jack. Don't forget how Brown and  Martell acted--and are acting still.\"    \"I won't forget, Ruth.\" And then, making sure that none of the others  was noticing, he pressed the girl's fingers tightly within his own.  \"It's awfully nice to have you so interested,\" he whispered. And,  although she did not answer to this, she gave him a bright look that  lingered in his memory for many a day afterward.    In the meantime Fred was walking along with May Powell, and had also  been congratulated on attaining a lieutenancy. May was full of fun,  and her eyes showed it.    \"I suppose some day it will be Major Fred Rover!\" she exclaimed. \"My,  won't you look grand with a whole lot of gold lace, and a cockade hat,  and all that sort of thing!\"    \"No gold lace for mine, May!\" he laughed.    Spouter and Gif were walking with Martha and Mary, and soon the whole  crowd reached Clearwater Hall. Here the boys had to say good-bye to  the girls, and this was rather a lingering process, since the young  folks did not know exactly when they would get together again.    \"But don't forget we expect to march past here to-morrow morning about  ten o'clock,\" said Jack. \"If you are really patriotic you'll be  watching for us and have your flags out.\"    \"Don't you worry about that,\" answered Ruth. \"We're going to ask Miss  Garwood for a special recess in honor of the occasion.\"    The evening was spent by the boys in packing their things and in  otherwise getting ready for the encampment. There was, however, the  usual song service at eight o'clock in the assembly room of the Hall,  on this occasion presided over by a minister who had stopped at the  Hall to visit his two nephews, who were pupils there. The minister was  a good speaker, and he made an address which the cadets listened to  with close attention.    Early in the morning came a sound that told all the cadets that the  annual encampment was now at hand. Instead of the school bell ringing,  there were the notes of two bugles ringing through the corridors. Then  from outside came the vigorous rattle of several drums.    \"Hurrah! No more studying! From now on we are soldier boys!\" exclaimed  Andy, and he bounced out of bed. \"Get up, you sleepyheads!\" And in the  exuberance of his spirits he threw a pillow at his twin's head. Randy  returned the compliment by throwing a shoe at him, hitting Andy in the  stomach.    \"Hi! What's this?\" exclaimed Fred, scrambling up at the confusion.    \"Over the top at the Huns!\" shouted Andy, charging on Randy and  sending him backward into a stand loaded with books. \"Forward, the  light brigade, and on to the gas attack!\"    \"Hi! You fellows are making altogether too much noise,\" came from  Jack. \"Attention, company! Line up! Eyes right!\"    \"My! but don't the bugles and drums sound fine?\" was Fred's comment,  as he hurried into his new uniform, of which, it may be said  privately, he was exceedingly proud.    \"I suppose we won't have a bit of fun at this outing, with a captain  and a lieutenant keeping their eyes on us,\" grumbled Andy; but, of  course, he did not mean what he said.    \"Sure, I'll make you line up and toe the chalk mark,\" answered Jack,  with a grin. \"You won't dare to call your souls your own. If you  infringe one fixed rule the sixteenth of an inch, I'll place you in  the guardhouse.\"    \"Yes, and we'll feed you on nothing but dry bread and dry water,\"  added Fred.    \"Good-night!\" came solemnly from Randy. \"Please lead me to the  dungeon at once! What's the use of looking at the sunshine and trying  to smile!\"    It had been decided that the cadets should march to Barlight Bay,  which was about thirty-five miles distant. They were to take two days  for the journey, stopping over night on the outskirts of the village  of Rackville, where Captain Dale had already rented a farm field for  that purpose. All of their belongings were to be transported in  several motor trucks, engaged for that purpose, these trucks being  under orders from the battalion quartermaster.    Of course, it must be understood by my young readers that Colby Hall  was only a military school for boys, and that the military matters  there, while conducted somewhat on the lines of those at West Point,  were by no means so strict. The officers, from the young major down,  were expected to do their duty the same as if they were at a  government camp, but all were under the supervision of Captain Dale  and the Hall professors.    More than this, the boys did not pretend to do any of the camp cooking  or any of the menial camp labor, this being accomplished by hired  helpers. And again, the officers were only officers while on parade or  during special hours of duty--otherwise they were just like the  other cadets and were treated accordingly.    There was the usual morning roll call, and also the drill and  inspection, this time the latter being unusually severe, for Captain  Dale wanted to make sure that everything was right before the cadets  left the Hall. The parade around the grounds, however, was omitted,  and the lads went in to their breakfast half an hour earlier than  usual. Then it was announced that they would leave the Hall at exactly  nine o'clock.    At the roll call and inspection it was a new thing for Jack to take  command of Company C, and for Fred to fill the position of a  lieutenant; but both acquitted themselves creditably, and for this  received a nod of approval from Captain Dale.    On Sunday evening it had been rumored about that Gabe Werner had  decided not to attend the encampment. This rumor had its foundation in  the fact that the angular ex-lieutenant had sent a telegram to his  father explaining the situation and stating he wanted to come home. In  return, however, Mr. Werner commanded his son to remain at Colby Hall,  and so, much against his will, Gabe was on hand when the cadets were  ready to march away.    \"But I ain't going to do anything that I don't want to do,\" growled  Gabe to Bill Glutts. \"You just wait and see!\"    \"Maybe you'll get a chance to make it warm for Jack Rover and his  bunch,\" suggested the wholesale butcher's son.    \"You bet!\" answered Werner laconically.    The cadets were all assembled on the parade ground, and the motor  trucks, piled high with all of their belongings, as well as the  camping paraphernalia, had already left the grounds. There was a final  rattle of drums to call any cadets who might still be missing.    \"Battalion attention!\" commanded the young major, after he had  received his orders from Captain Dale.    At once the three companies came to attention.    \"Shoulder arms!\" came the command a few seconds later.  \"Forward--march!\"    Boom! Boom! Boom, boom, boom! went the drums, and the Colby cadets  stepped off gaily, while the professors and helpers left behind at the  Hall cheered loudly and waved their hands. From the big flagstaff on  the campus floated a large American flag, this being run up every  morning at sunrise and taken down at sunset.    Soon the drums gave a preliminary rattle, and then the shrill fifes  struck up into a lively marching air, and one company after another  passed out of the Hall grounds and on to the road leading to Haven  Point.    \"Hay foot, straw foot!\" murmured Andy jokingly to Randy, who was  marching by his side. \"I wonder how our feet will feel after we have  covered the eighteen miles we have to do to-day?\"    \"Oh, that will be all right, I think,\" answered his twin. \"I've done  more than eighteen miles in a day, and so have you.\"    It did not take long for the cadets to reach the outskirts of Haven  Point. Their coming was expected, and quite a crowd of town folks were  out to see "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23319"],[0,"Mechanical Drawing Self-Taught (#20)"],[1," _h_, _i_, _j_;  from the ends of these (where they meet the centre line of A in the top  view), half-circles _k_, _l_, _m_, _n_, _o_, are drawn to meet the  circle of B in the top view, and from their points of intersection with  B, lines _p_, _q_, _r_, _s_, _t_, are drawn, and where these meet lines  _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_ and _e_, which is at _u_, _v_, _w_, _x_, _y_, are  points in the curve.    [Illustration: Fig. 230.]    [Illustration: Fig. 231.]    It will be observed, on referring again to Figure 229, that the branch  or cylinder B appears to be of elliptical section on its end face,  which occurs because it is seen at an angle to its end surface; now the  method of finding the ellipse for any given degree of angle is as in  Figure 231, in which B represents a cylindrical body whose top face  would, if viewed from point I, appear as a straight line, while if  viewed from point J it would appear in outline a circle. Now if viewed  from point E its apparent dimension in one direction will obviously be  defined by the lines S, Z. So that if on a line G G at a right angle to  the line of vision E, we mark points touching lines S, Z, we get points  1 and 2, representing the apparent dimension in that direction which is  the width of the ellipse. The length of the ellipse will obviously be  the full diameter of the cylinder B; hence from E as a centre we mark  points 3 and 4, and of the remaining points we will speak presently.  Suppose now the angle the top face of B is viewed from is denoted by the  line L, and lines S', Z, parallel to L, will be the width for the  ellipse whose length is marked by dots, equidistant on each side of  centre line G' G', which equal in their widths one from the other the  full diameter of B. In this construction the ellipse will be drawn away  from the cylinder B, and the ellipse, after being found, would have to  be transferred to the end of B. But since centre line G G is obviously  at the same angle to A A that A A is to G G, we may start from the  centre line of the body whose elliptical appearance is to be drawn, and  draw a centre line A A at the same angle to G G as the end of B is  supposed to be viewed from. This is done in Figure 231 _a_, in which the  end face of B is to be drawn viewed from a point on the line G G, but at  an angle of 45 degrees; hence line A A is drawn at an angle of 45  degrees to centre line G G, and centre line E is drawn from the centre  of the end of B at a right angle to G G, and from where it cuts A A, as  at F, a side view of B is drawn, or a single line of a length equal to  the diameter of B may be drawn at a right angle to A A and equidistant  on each side of F. A line, D D, at a right angle to A A, and at any  convenient distance above F, is then drawn, and from its intersection  with A A as a centre, a circle C equal to the diameter of B is drawn;  one-half of the circumference of C is divided off into any number of  equal divisions as by arcs _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_, _e_, _f_. From these  points of division, lines _g_, _h_, _i_, _j_, _k_, _l_ are drawn, and  also lines _m_, _n_, _o_, _p_, _q_, _r_. From the intersection of these  last lines with the face in the side view, lines _s_, _t_, _u_, _t_,  _w_, _x_, _y_, _z_ are drawn, and from point F line E is drawn. Now it  is clear that the width of the end face of the cylinder will appear the  same from any point of view it may be looked at, hence the sides H H are  made to equal the diameter of the cylinder B and marked up to centre  line E.    [Illustration: Fig. 231 _a_.]    [Illustration: Fig. 232.]    It is obvious also that the lines _s_, _z_, drawn from the extremes of  the face to be projected will define the width of the ellipse, hence we  have four of the points (marked respectively 1, 2, 3, 4) in the ellipse.  To obtain the remaining points, lines _t_, _u_, _v_, _w_, _x_, _y_  (which start from the point on the face F where the lines _m_, _n_, _o_,  _p_, _q_, _r_, respectively meet it) are drawn across the face of B as  shown. The compasses are then set to the radius _g_; that is, from  centre line D to division _a_ on the circle, and this radius is  transferred to the face to be projected the compass-point being rested  at the intersection of centre line G and line _t_, and two arcs as 5 and  6 drawn, giving two more points in the curve of the ellipse. The  compasses are then set to the length of line _h_ (that is, from centre  line D to point of division _b_), and this distance is transferred,  setting the compasses on centre line G where it is intersected by line  _u_, and arcs 7, 8 are marked, giving two more points in the ellipse. In  like manner points 9 and 10 are obtained from the length of line _i_, 11  and 12 from that of _j_; points 13 and 14 from the length of _k_, and 15  and 16 from _l_, and the ellipse may be drawn in from these points.    It may be pointed out, however, that since points 5 and 6 are the same  distance from G that points 15 and 16 are, and since points 7 and 8 are  the same distance from G that points 13 and 14 are, while points 9 and  10 are the same distance from G that 11 and 12 are, the lines, _j_, _k_,  _l_ are unnecessary, since _l_ and _g_ are of equal length, as are also  _h_ and _k_ and _i_ and _j_. In Figure 232 the cylinders are line shaded  to make them show plainer to the eye, and but three lines (_a_, _b_,  _c_) are used to get the radius wherefrom to mark the arcs where the  points in the ellipse shall fall; thus, radius _a_ gives points 1, 2, 3  and 4; radius _b_ gives points 5, 6, 7 and 8, and radius _c_ gives 9,  10, 11 and 12, the extreme diameter being obtained from lines S, Z, and  H, H.          CHAPTER XI.    _DRAWING GEAR WHEELS._      The names given to the various lines of a tooth on a gear-wheel are as  follows:    In Figure 233, A is the face and B the flank of a tooth, while C is the  point, and D the root of the tooth; E is the height or depth, and F the  breadth. P P is the pitch circle, and the space between the two teeth,  as H, is termed a space.    [Illustration: Fig. 233.]    [Illustration: Fig. 234.]    It is obvious that the points of the teeth and the bottoms of the  spaces, as well as the pitch circle, are concentric to the axis of the  wheel bore. And to pencil in the teeth these circles must be fully  drawn, as in Figure 234, in which P P is the pitch circle. This circle  is divided into as many equal divisions as the wheel is to have teeth,  these divisions being denoted by the radial lines, A, B, C, etc. Where  these divisions intersect the pitch circle are the centres from which  all the teeth curves may be drawn. The compasses are set to a radius  equal to the pitch, less one-half the thickness of the tooth, and from a  centre, as R, two face curves, as F G, may be marked; from the next  centre, as at S, the curves D E may be marked, and so on for all the  faces; that is, the tooth curves lying between the outer circle X and  the pitch circle P. For the flank curves, that is, the curve from P to  Y, the compasses are set to a radius equal to the pitch; and from the  sides of the teeth the flank curves are drawn. Thus from J, as a centre  flank, K is drawn; from V, as a centre flank, H is drawn, and so on.    The proportions of the teeth for cast gears generally accepted in this  country are those given by Professor Willis, as average practice, and  are as follows:    Depth to pitch line, 3/10 of the pitch.  Working depth,       6/10     \"    \"  Whole depth,         7/10     \"    \"  Thickness of tooth,  5/11     \"    \"  Breadth of space,    6/11     \"    \"    Instead, however, of calculating the dimensions these proportions give  for any particular pitch, a diagram or scale may be made from which they  may be taken for any pitch by a direct application of the compasses. A  scale of this kind is given in Figure 235, in which the line A B is  divided into inches and parts to represent the pitches; its total length  representing the coarsest pitch within the capacity of the scale; and,  the line B C (at a right-angle to A B) the whole depth of the tooth for  the coarsest pitch, being 7/10 of the length of A B.    [Illustration: Fig. 235.]    The other diagonal lines are for the proportion of the dimensions marked  on the figure. Thus the depth of face, or distance from the pitch line  to the extremity or tooth point for a 4 inch pitch, would be measured  along the line B C, from the vertical line B to the first diagonal. The  thickness of the tooth would be for a 4 inch pitch along line B C from B  to the second diagonal, and so on. For a 3 inch pitch the measurement  would be taken along the horizontal line, starting from the 3 on the  line A B, and so on. On the left of the diagram or scale is marked the  lbs. strain each pitch will safely transmit per inch width of wheel  face, according to Professor Marks.    [Illustration: Fig. 236.]    The application of the scale as follows: The pitch circles P P and P'  P', Figure 236, for the respective wheels, are drawn, and the height of  the teeth is obtained from the scale and marked beyond the pitch  circles, when circles Q and Q' may be drawn. Similarly, the depths of  the teeth within the pitch circles are obtained from the scale or  diagram and marked within the respective pitch circles, and circles R  and R' are marked in. The pitch circles are divided off into as many  points of equal division, as at _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_, _e_, etc., as the  respective wheels are to have teeth, and the thickness of tooth having  been obtained from the scale, this thickness is marked from the points  of division on the pitch circles, as at _f_ in the figure, and the tooth  curves may then be drawn in. It may be observed, however, that the tooth  thicknesses will not be strictly correct, because the scale gives the  same chord pitch for the teeth on both wheels which will give different  arc pitches to the teeth on the two wheels; whereas, it is the arc  pitches, and not"]]]
