Suleiman's horse gave in--we had been for about twenty  minutes at a killing pace. Tetel, although not a fast horse, was good  for a distance, and he now proved his power of endurance, as I was  riding at least two stone heavier than any of the party. Only four of  the seven remained; and we swept down the incline, Taher Sherif still  leading, and Abou Do the last! His horse was done, but not the rider;  for, springing to the ground while at full speed, sword in hand, he  forsook his tired horse, and, preferring his own legs, he ran like an  antelope, and, for the first hundred yards I thought lie would really  pass us and win the honor of first blow. It was of no use, the pace was  too severe, and, although running wonderfully, he was obliged to give  way to the horses. Only three now followed the rhinoceroses--Taher  Sherrif, his brother Roder, and myself. I had been obliged to give the  second place to Roder, as he was a mere monkey in weight; but I was a  close third.    The excitement was intense. We neared the jungle, and the rhinoceroses  began to show signs of flagging, as the dust puffed up before their  nostrils, and, with noses close to the ground, they snorted as they  still galloped on. Oh for a fresh horse! \"A horse! a horse! my kingdom  for a horse!\" We were within two hundred yards of the jungle; but the  horses were all done. Tetel reeled as I urged him forward. Roder pushed  ahead. We were close to the dense thorns, and the rhinoceroses  broke into a trot; they were done! \"Now, Taher, for-r-a-a-r-r-d!  for-r-r-a-a-r-d, Taher!!\"    Away he went. He was close to the very heels of the beasts, but his  horse could do no more than his present pace; still he gained upon the  nearest. He leaned forward with his sword raised for the blow. Another  moment and the jungle would be reached! One effort more, and the sword  flashed in the sunshine, as the rear-most rhinoceros disappeared in  the thick screen of thorns, with a gash about a foot long upon his  hind-quarters. Taher Sherrif shook his bloody sword in triumph above  his head, but the rhinoceros was gone. We were fairly beaten, regularly  outpaced; but I believe another two hundred yards would have given us  the victory. \"Bravo, Taher!\" I shouted. He had ridden splendidly, and  his blow had been marvellously delivered at an extremely long reach,  as he was nearly out of his saddle when he sprang forward to enable  the blade to obtain a cut at the last moment. He could not reach the  hamstring, as his horse could not gain the proper position.    We all immediately dismounted. The horses were thoroughly done, and I at  once loosened the girths and contemplated my steed Tetel, who, with head  lowered and legs wide apart, was a tolerable example of the effects  of pace. The other aggageers shortly arrived, and as the rival Abou Do  joined us, Taher Sherrif quietly wiped the blood off his sword without  making a remark. This was a bitter moment for the discomfited Abou Do.    There is only one species of rhinoceros in Abyssinia; this is the  two-horned black rhinoceros, known in South Africa as the keitloa. This  animal is generally five feet six inches to five feet eight inches  high at the shoulder, and, although so bulky and heavily built, it is  extremely active, as our long and fruitless hunt had shown us. The skin  is about half the thickness of that of the hippopotamus, but of extreme  toughness and closeness of texture. When dried and polished it resembles  horn. Unlike the Indian species of rhinoceros, the black variety of  Africa is free from folds, and the hide fits smoothly on the body  like that of the buffalo. This two-horned black species is exceedingly  vicious. It is one of the very few animals that will generally assume  the offensive; it considers all creatures to be enemies, and, although  it is not acute in either sight or hearing, it possesses so wonderful a  power of scent that it will detect a stranger at a distance of five or  six hundred yards should the wind be favorable.    Florian was now quite incapable of hunting, as he was in a weak state of  health, and had for some months been suffering from chronic dysentery.  I had several times cured him, but he had a weakness for the strongest  black coffee, which, instead of drinking, like the natives, in minute  cups, he swallowed wholesale in large basins several times a day; this  was actual poison with his complaint, and he was completely ruined in  health. At this time his old companion, Johann Schmidt, the carpenter,  arrived, having undertaken a contract to provide for the Italian  Zoological Gardens a number of animals. I therefore proposed that the  two old friends should continue together, while I would hunt by myself,  with the aggageers, toward the east and south. This arrangement was  agreed to, and we parted.    Our camels returned from Geera with corn, accompanied by an Abyssinian  hunter, who was declared by Abou Do to be a good man and dexterous with  the sword. We accordingly moved our camp, said adieu to Florian and  Johann, and penetrated still deeper into the country of the Bas-e.    Our course lay, as usual, along the banks of the river. We decided to  encamp at a spot known to the Arabs as Deladilla. This was the forest  upon the margin of the river where I had first shot the bull elephant  when the aggageers fought with him upon foot. I resolved to fire the  entire country on the following day, and to push still farther up the  course of the Settite to the foot of the mountains, and to return to  this camp in about a fortnight, by which time the animals that had  been scared away by the fire would have returned. Accordingly, on the  following morning, accompanied by a few of the aggageers, I started  upon the south bank of the river, and rode for some distance into the  interior, to the ground that was entirely covered with high withered  grass. We were passing through a mass of kittar and thorn-bush, almost  hidden by the immensely high grass, when, as I was ahead of the party,  I came suddenly upon the tracks of rhinoceroses. These were so  unmistakably recent that I felt sure we were not far from the animals  themselves. As I had wished to fire the grass, I was accompanied by my  Tokrooris and my horse-keeper, Mahomet No. 2. It was difficult ground  for the men, and still more unfavorable for the horses, as large  disjointed masses of stone were concealed in the high grass.    We were just speculating as to the position of the rhinoceros, and  thinking how uncommonly unpleasant it would be should he obtain our  wind, when whiff! whiff! whiff! We heard the sharp whistling snort, with  a tremendous rush through the high grass and thorns close to us, and  at the same moment two of these determined brutes were upon us in full  charge. I never saw such a scrimmage. SAUVE QUI PEUT! There was no time  for more than one look behind. I dug the spurs into Aggahr's flanks, and  clasping him round the neck I ducked my head down to his shoulder, well  protected with my strong hunting-cap, and kept the spurs going as hard  as I could ply them, blindly trusting to Providence and my good horse.  Over big rocks, fallen trees, thick kittar thorns, and grass ten feet  high, with the two infernal animals in full chase only a few feet behind  me! I heard their abominable whiffing close to me, but so did my good  horse, and the good old hunter flew over obstacles in a way I should  have thought impossible, and he dashed straight under the hooked  thorn-bushes and doubled like a hare. The aggageers were all scattered;  Mahomet No. 2 was knocked over by a rhinoceros; all the men were  sprawling upon the rocks with their guns, and the party was entirely  discomfited.    Having passed the kittar thorn I turned, and, seeing that the beasts had  gone straight on, I brought Aggahr's head round and tried to give chase;  but it was perfectly impossible. It was only a wonder that the horse had  escaped in ground so difficult for riding. Although my clothes were of  the strongest and coarsest Arab cotton cloth, which seldom tore, but  simply lost a thread when caught in a thorn, I was nearly naked. My  blouse was reduced to shreds. As I wore sleeves only half way from  the shoulder to the elbow, my naked arms were streaming with blood.  Fortunately my hunting-cap was secured with a chin strap, and still more  fortunately I had grasped the horse's neck; otherwise I must have been  dragged out of the saddle by the hooked thorns. All the men were cut and  bruised, some having fallen upon their heads among the rocks, and others  had hurt their legs in falling in their endeavors to escape. Mahomet  No. 2, the horse-keeper, was more frightened than hurt, as he had been  knocked down by the shoulder and not by the horn of the rhinoceros, as  the animal had not noticed him; its attention was absorbed by the horse.    I determined to set fire to the whole country immediately, and  descending the hill toward the river to obtain a favorable wind, I put  my men in a line, extending over about a mile along the river's bed,  and they fired the grass in different places. With a loud roar the flame  leaped high in air and rushed forward with astonishing velocity. The  grass was as inflammable as tinder, and the strong north wind drove the  long line of fire spreading in every direction through the country.        CHAPTER X.    A day with the howartis--A hippo's gallant fight--Abou Do leaves  us--Three yards from a lion--Days of delight--A lion's furious  rage--Astounding courage of a horse.    A LITTLE before sunrise I accompanied the howartis, or  hippopotamus-hunters, for a day's sport. At length we arrived at a large  pool in which were several sand-banks covered with rushes, and many  rocky islands. Among these rocks was a herd of hippopotami, consisting  of an old bull and several cows."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32455"],[0,"Christmas Eve and Christmas Day: Ten Christmas stories (#20)"],[1,"ours,              HORACE BARTLETT.        P. S. I have shown Worster what I have written; he encloses a      sort of official letter which may be of use. He says, \"Show this      to Dr. Hayward; get them to examine you and the others, and then      the government, on his order, will pass you on.\" I enclose this,      because, if you come, it will save time.    Of course Huldah went. Grace Starr, her married sister, went with her,  and Mrs. Philbrick, and Anna Thwart. That was the way they happened to  be all together in the Methodist Church that had been, of Talbot Court  House, as Christmas holidays drew near, of the year of grace, 1863.    She and her friends had been there quite long enough to be wonted to the  strangeness of December in the open air. On her little table in front of  the desk of the church were three or four buttercups in bloom, which she  had gathered in an afternoon walk, with three or four heads of  hawksweed. \"The beginning of one year,\" Huldah said, \"with the end of  the other.\" Nay, there was even a stray rose which Dr. Sprigg had found  in a farmer's garden. Huldah came out from the vestry, where her own bed  was, in the gray of the morning, changed the water for the poor little  flowers, sat a moment at the table to look at last night's memoranda,  and then beckoned to the ward-master, and asked him, in a whisper, what  was the movement she had heard in the night,--\"Another alarm from  Early?\"    \"No, Miss; not an alarm. I saw the Colonel's orderly as he passed. He  stopped here for Dr. Fenno's case. There had come down an express from  General Mitchell, and the men were called without the bugle, each man  separately; not a horse was to neigh, if they could help it. And really,  Miss, they were off in twenty minutes.\"    \"Off, who are off?\"    \"The whole post, Miss, except the relief for to-day. There are not fifty  men in the village besides us here. The orderly thought they were to go  down to Braxton's; but he did not know.\"    Here was news indeed! news so exciting that Huldah went back at once,  and called the other women; and then all of them together began on that  wretched business of waiting. They had never yet known what it was to  wait for a real battle. They had had their beds filled with this and  that patient from one or another post, and had some gun-shot wounds of  old standing among the rest; but this was their first battle if it were  a battle. So the covers were taken off that long line of beds, down on  the west aisle, and from those under the singers' seat; and the sheets  and pillow-cases were brought out from the linen room, and aired, and  put on. Our biggest kettles are filled up with strong soup; and we have  our milk-punch, and our beef-tea all in readiness; and everybody we can  command is on hand to help lift patients and distribute food. But there  is only too much time. Will there never be any news? Anna Thwart and  Doctor Sprigg have walked down to the bend of the hill, to see if any  messenger is coming. As for the other women, they sit at their table;  they look at their watches; they walk down to the door; they come back  to the table. I notice they have all put on fresh aprons, for the sake  of doing something more in getting ready.    Here is Anna Thwart. \"They are coming! they are coming! somebody is  coming. A mounted man is crossing the flat, coming towards us; and the  doctor told me to come back and tell.\" Five minutes more, ten minutes  more, an eternity more, and then, rat-tat-tat, rat-tat-tat, the mounted  man is here. \"Wagons right behind. We bagged every man of them at  Wyatt's. Got there before daylight. Colonel White's men from the Yellows  came up just at the same time, and we pitched in before they knew  it,--three or four regiments, thirteen hundred men, and all their guns.\"    \"And with no fighting?\"    \"Oh, yes! fighting of course. The colonel has got a train of wagons down  here with the men that are hurt. That's why I am here. Here is his  note.\" Thus does the mounted man discharge his errand backward.        DEAR DOCTOR,--We have had great success. We have surprised the      whole post. The company across the brook tried hard to get away;      and a good many of them, and of Sykes's men, are hit; but I      cannot find that we have lost more than seven men. I have      nineteen wagons here of wounded men,--some hurt pretty badly.            Ever yours,      H.    So there must be more waiting. But now we know what we are waiting for;  and the end will come in a finite world. Thank God, at half-past three,  here they are! Tenderly, gently. \"Hush, Sam! Hush, Caesar! You talk too  much.\" Gently, tenderly. Twenty-seven of the poor fellows, with  everything the matter, from a burnt face to a heart stopping its beats  for want of more blood.    \"Huldah, come here. This is my old classmate, Barthow; sat next me at  prayers four years. He is a major in their army, you see. His horse  stumbled, and pitched him against a stone wall; and he has not spoken  since. Don't tell me he is dying; but do as well for him, Huldah,\"--and  the handsome boy smiled,--\"do as well for him as you did for me.\" So  they carried Barthow, senseless as he was, tenderly into the church; and  he became E, 27, on an iron bedstead. Not half our soup was wanted, nor  our beef-tea, nor our punch. So much the better.    Then came day and night, week in and out, of army system, and womanly  sensibility; that quiet, cheerful, _homish_, hospital life, in the  quaint surroundings of the white-washed church; the pointed arches of  the windows and the faded moreen of the pulpit telling that it is a  church, in a reminder not unpleasant. Two or three weeks of hopes and  fears, failures and success, bring us to Christmas eve.           *       *       *       *       *    It is the surgeon-in-chief, who happens to give our particular Christmas  dinner,--I mean the one that interests you and me. Huldah and the other  ladies had accepted his invitation. Horace Bartlett and his staff, and  some of the other officers, were guests; and the doctor had given his  own permit that Major Barthow might walk up to his quarters with the  ladies. Huldah and he were in advance, he leaning, with many apologies,  on her arm. Dr. Sprigg and Anna Thwart were far behind. The two married  ladies, as needing no escort, were in the middle. Major Barthow enjoyed  the emancipation, was delighted with his companion, could not say enough  to make her praise the glimpses of Virginia, even if it were West  Virginia.    \"What a party it is, to be sure!\" said he. \"The doctor might call on us  for our stories, as one of Dickens's chiefs would do at a Christmas  feast. Let's see, we should have        THE SURGEON'S TALE;      THE GENERAL'S TALE;    for we may at least make believe that Hod's stars have come from  Washington. Then we must call in that one-eyed servant of his; and we  will have        THE ORDERLY'S TALE.    Your handsome friend from Wisconsin shall tell        THE GERMAN'S TALE.    I shall be encouraged to tell        THE PRISONER'S TALE.    And you\"--    \"And I?\" said Huldah laughing, because he paused.    \"You shall tell        THE SAINT'S TALE.\"    Barthow spoke with real feeling, which he did not care to disguise. But  Huldah was not there for sentiment; and without quivering in the least,  nor making other acknowledgment, she laughed as she knew she ought to  do, and said, \"Oh, no! that is quite too grand, the story must end with        THE SUPERINTENDENT OF SPECIAL RELIEF'S      TALE.    It is a little unromantic to the sound; but that's what it is.\"    \"I don't see,\" persisted the major, \"if Superintendent of Special Relief  means Saint in Latin, why we should not say so.\"    \"Because we are not talking Latin,\" said Huldah. \"Listen to me; and,  before we come to dinner, I will tell you a story pretty enough for  Dickens, or any of them; and it is a story not fifteen minutes old.    \"Have you noticed that black-whiskered fellow, under the gallery, by the  north window?--Yes, the same. He is French, enlisted, I think, in New  London. I came to him just now, managed to say _etrennes_ and _Noel_ to  him, and a few other French words, and asked if there were nothing we  could do to make him more at home. Oh, no! there was nothing; madame  was too good, and everybody was too good, and so on. But I persisted. I  wished I knew more about Christmas in France; and I staid by. 'No,  madame, nothing; there is nothing. But, since you say it,--if there were  two drops of red wine,--_du vin de mon pays, madame_; but you could not  here in Virginia.' Could not I? A superintendent of special relief has  long arms. There was a box of claret, which was the first thing I saw in  the store-room the day I took my keys. The doctor was only too glad the  man had thought of it; and you should have seen the pleasure that red  glass, as full as I could pile it, gave him. The tears were running down  his cheeks. Anna, there, had another Frenchman; and she sent some to  him: and my man is now humming a little song about the _vin rouge_ of  Bourgogne. Would not Mr. Dickens make a pretty story of that for  you,--'THE FRENCHMAN'S STORY'?\"    Barthow longed to say that the great novelist would not make so pretty a  story as she did. But this time he did not dare.    You are not going to hear the eight stories. Mr. Dickens was not there;  nor, indeed, was I. But a jolly Christmas dinner they had; though they  had not those eight stories. Quiet they were, and very, very happy. It  was a strange thing,--if one could have analyzed it,--that they should  have felt so much at home, and so much at ease with each other, in that  queer Virginian kitchen, where the doctor and his friends of his mess  had arranged the feast. It was a happy thing, that the recollections of  so many other Christmas homes should come in, not sadly, but pleasantly,  and should cheer, rather than shade the evening. They felt off  soundings,"]]]
