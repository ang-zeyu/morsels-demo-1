Notwithstanding its bad company, this agaric has a good  reputation, especially for making ketchup; and Cordier reports it  as one of the most delicate mushrooms of the Lorraine.[C] Its name  is derived from its tendency to become red when bruised.    The white variety of an allied species (_Agaricus vaginatus_) has been  commended, and Dr. Badham says that it will be found inferior to but  few agarics in flavour.    A scaly-capped fungus (_Agaricus procerus_), with a slender stem,  called sometimes the parasol mushroom, from its habit, is an esteemed  esculent. In Italy and France it is in high request, and is included  in the majority of continental works on the edible fungi.[D] In  Austria, Germany, and Spain, it has special \"vulgar\" names, and is  eaten in all these countries. It is much more collected in England  than formerly, but deserves to be still better known. When once seen  it can scarcely be confounded with any other British species, save one  of its nearest allies, which partakes of its own good qualities  (_Agaricus rachodes_), though not quite so good.    _Agaricus prunulus_, Scop., and _Agaricus orcella_, Badh., if they be  not forms of the same species (which Dr. Bull contends that they are  not[E]), have also a good reputation as esculents. They are both neat,  white agarics, with a mealy odour, growing respectively in woods and  open glades. _Agaricus nebularis_, Batsch, is a much larger species,  found in woods, often in large gregarious patches amongst dead leaves,  with a smoky mouse-coloured pileus, and profuse white spores. It is  sometimes as much as five or six inches in diameter, with rather a  faint odour and mild taste. On the continent, as well as in Britain,  this is included amongst edible fungi. Still larger and more imposing  is the magnificent white species, _Agaricus maximus_, Fr.,[F] which is  figured by Sowerby,[G] under the name of _Agaricus giganteus_. It will  attain a diameter of fourteen inches, with a stem, two inches thick,  and rather a strong odour.    A spring fungus, the true St. George's mushroom, _Agaricus gambosus_,  Fr., makes its appearance in pastures, usually growing in rings, in  May and June, and is welcome to mycophagists from its early growth,  when esculent species are rare. It is highly esteemed in France and  Italy, so that when dried it will realize as much as from twelve to  fifteen shillings per pound. Guillarmod includes it amongst Swiss  esculents.[H] Professor Buckman says that it is one of the earliest  and best of English mushrooms, and others have endorsed his opinions,  and Dr. Badham in writing of it observes, that small baskets of them,  when they first appear in the spring in Italy, are sent as \"presents  to lawyers and fees to medical men.\"    The closely allied species, _Agaricus albellus_,[I] D.C., has also the  reputation of being edible, but it is so rare in England that this  quality cannot be put to the test. The curious short-stemmed _Agaricus  brevipes_, Bull,[J] has a similar reputation.    Two singularly fragrant species are also included amongst the  esculent. These are _Agaricus fragrans_, Sow., and _Agaricus odorus_,  Bull. Both have a sweet anise-like odour, which is persistent for a  long time. The former is pale tawny-coloured, nearly white, the latter  of a dirty pale green. Both are white-spored, and although somewhat  local, sufficient specimens of _Ag. odorus_ may be collected in the  autumn for domestic use. We have the assurance of one who has often  proved them that they constitute an exquisite dish.    A clear ivory-white fungus, _Agaricus dealbatus_, of which a crisped  variety is occasionally found in great numbers, springing up on old  mushroom beds in dense clusters, is very good eating, but rather  deficient in the delicate aroma of some other species. The typical  form is not uncommon on the ground in fir plantations. A more robust  and larger species, _Agaricus geotrupes_, Bull, found on the borders  of woods, often forming rings, both in this country and in the United  States, as well as on the continent of Europe, is recognized as  esculent.    We may add to these three or four other species, in which the stem is  lateral, and sometimes nearly obsolete. The largest and most common is  the oyster mushroom (_Agaricus ostreatus_, Jacq.[K]), so universally  eaten, that it is included in almost every list and book on edible  fungi; it is the most common species in Transylvania, tons of it  sometimes appearing in the markets. It does not possess that delicate  flavour which is found in many species, and although extolled by some  beyond its merits, it is nevertheless perfectly wholesome, and, when  young and carefully cooked, not to be despised. It must not be  confounded with a very similar species (_Agaricus euosmus_, B.), with  rosy spores, which is unpleasant. _Agaricus tessellatus_, Bull,  _Agaricus pometi_, Fr., _Agaricus glandulosus_, Bull, are all allies  of the foregoing, and recorded as edible in the United States,  although not one of the three has hitherto been recorded as occurring  in Great Britain. To these may also be added the following:--_Agaricus  salignus_,[L] Fr., which is rare in England, but not uncommon abroad  and in the United States. In Austria it is commonly eaten. _Agaricus  ulmarius_,[M] Bull, is common on elm trunks, not only in Britain but  also in North America, and is by some preferred to the oyster  mushroom. An allied species, _Agaricus fossulatus_, Cooke,[N] is found  on the Cabul Hills, where it is collected, dried, and forms an article  of commerce with the plains. Another, but smaller species, is dried in  the air on strings passed through a hole in the short stem (_Agaricus  subocreatus_, Cooke), and sent, it is believed, from China to  Singapore.    The smallest species with which we have any acquaintance, that is  edible, is the \"nail fungus\" (_Agaricus esculentus_,[O] Jacq.),  scarcely exceeding one inch in diameter of the pileus, with a thin  rooting stem. The taste in British specimens when raw is bitter and  unpleasant, but it is clearly eaten in Austria, as its name testifies,  and elsewhere in Europe. It is found in fir plantations in the spring,  at which season it is collected from the fir woods around and sent to  Vienna, where it is only used for flavouring sauces under the name of  \"Nagelschwaemme.\"    Before quitting the group of true agarics, to which all hitherto  enumerated belong, we must mention a few others of less importance,  but which are included amongst those good for food. Foremost of these  is a really splendid orange species (_Agaricus caesarius_, Scop.[P]),  which belongs to the same subgenus as the very deleterious fly-agaric,  and the scarcely less fatal _Agaricus vernus_, Bull. It is universally  eaten on the continent, but has hitherto never been found in Great  Britain. In the same subgenus, _Agaricus strobiliformis_,[Q] Fr.,  which is rare in this country, and probably also _Agaricus Ceciliae_,  B. & Br.[R] Besides these, _Agaricus excoriatus_, Schaeff., _Agaricus  mastoideus_, Fr., _Agaricus gracilentus_, Kromb., and _Agaricus  holosericeus_, Fr.,[S] all belonging to the same subgenus as the  parasol mushroom, more or less uncommon in England.    Although the larger number of esculent agarics are white-spored, some  few, worthy of note, will be found in the other sections, and notably  amongst these the common mushroom and its congener the meadow, or  horse mushroom. In addition to those already enumerated, might be  included also the _Agaricus pudicus_, Bull, which is certainly  wholesome, as well as its ally, _Agaricus leochromus_, Cooke,[T] both  of which have rusty spores.    The late Dr. Curtis,[U] in a letter to the Rev. M. J. Berkeley,  enumerates several of the fungi which are edible amongst those found  in the United States. Of these, he says, _Agaricus amygdalinus_,  Curt., can scarcely be distinguished when cooked from the common  mushroom. _Agaricus frumentaceus_, Bull, and three allied new species,  peculiar to the United States, are commended. _Agaricus caespitosus_,  Curt., he says, is found in enormous quantities, a single cluster  containing from fifty to one hundred stems, and might well be deemed a  valuable species in times of scarcity. It would not be highly esteemed  where other and better species can be had, but it is generally  preferred to _Agaricus melleus_, Fr. It is suitable for drying for  winter use. In the same communication, he observes that the imperial  (_Agaricus caesarius_, Scop.), grows in great quantities in oak  forests, and may be obtained by the cart-load in its season; but to  his taste, and that of his family, it is the most unpalatable of  fungi, nor could he find any of the most passionate mycophagists who  would avow that they liked it. There is a disagreeable saline flavour  that they could not remove nor overlay. In addition to these, the same  authority enumerates _Agaricus russula_, Schaeff., _Agaricus  hypopithyus_, Curt., and _Agaricus consociatus_, Curt., the latter two  being confined to the United States; _Agaricus columbetta_, Fr., found  in Britain, but not eaten, as well as _Agaricus radicatus_, Bull.  _Agaricus bombycinus_, Schaeff., and _Agaricus speciosus_, Fr., are  found in Britain, but by no means common; _Agaricus squarrosus_,  Mull., has always been regarded with great suspicion in this country,  where it is by no means uncommon; _Agaricus cretaceus_, Fr., and  _Agaricus sylvaticus_, Schaeff., are close allies of the common  mushroom.    Dr. Curtis says that hill and plain, mountain and valley, woods,  fields, and pastures, swarm with a profusion of good nutritious fungi,  which are allowed to decay where they spring up, because people do not  know how, or are afraid, to use them. By those of us who know their  use, their value was appreciated, as never before,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30230"],[0,"A Story of the Red Cross; Glimpses of Field Work (#20)"],[1,"of people, frantic to learn the  fate of their friends on the island. Each trip to the mainland, the boat  came filled with refugees from the city of doom--the sick, the maimed,  the sorrowing--many with fearful bodily injuries inflicted by the storm,  and others with deeper wounds of grief;--mothers whose babies had been  torn from their arms, children whose parents were missing, fathers whose  entire families were lost--a dazed and tearless throng, such as Dante  might have met in his passage through Inferno. These were dumped by  thousands on the sandy beach at Texas City, and then conveyed by rail to  Houston, to be cared for by the good people of that city, who,  notwithstanding their own grievous losses, were doing noble work for  their stricken neighbors.    \"Of Texas City--a flourishing town of four or five thousand  houses--nothing remained but heaps of bricks and splintered wood, sodden  bales of cotton and bits of household furniture, scattered over the  plain; not a standing habitation within miles, nor any shelter for the  crowds above-mentioned, except two or three hospital-tents, hastily set  up for the sick and wounded, but inadequate for their accommodation.  What was our dismay when told that here we must remain at least  twenty-four hours, for the return of the boat! However, we were better  off, even physically, than most of the waiting crowd, though weariness  of the flesh amounted to actual suffering, after more than fifty hours'  travel. As a special courtesy to Miss Barton, the railway company left a  car to shelter her during the night. Luxurious Pullmans did not abound  at Texas City, and this was the shabbiest of day-coaches, equipped with  few 'modern conveniences.' But this was no time to think of personal  comfort, on the threshold of so much misery; and who could murmur when  the head of our little company set such an heroic example of patience. I  have seen her in many trying situations, that threatened the fortitude  and endurance of the strongest--and have yet to hear the first word of  complaint from her lips. She smilingly 'bunked' upon two seats laid  together--compared to which, for softness, the _penitente's_ slab of  stone would be as 'downy beds of ease'--and encouraged her companions to  do the same. Hunger and thirst would also have been our portion, had it  not been for a Salvation Army Corps encamped in the vicinity, and the  Relief Train of the Philadelphia North American, stranded like  ourselves. Thanks to those good Samaritans, we dined and breakfasted on  tinned beef, bread and coffee; and what more could good soldiers  require?    \"That night in Texas City will be long remembered. Sleep was out of the  question--stretched on those cross-bars, like St. Lawrence on his  gridiron. Soldiers patrolled the beach, not only to prevent a stampede  of the boat, but to protect both the quick and the dead from fiends in  human guise, who prowled the devastated region, committing atrocities  too horrible to name. All night the steady tramp, tramp, of the guard  sounded beneath the car-windows, while at either door stood two  sentinels, muskets on shoulders. Skies of inky blackness, studded with  stars of extraordinary brilliancy, seemed to bend much nearer the earth  than at the North; and the Great Dipper hung low on the horizon--for  only just across the Gulf it disappears to give place to the Southern  Cross. Myriads of big, bright fire-flies, resembling balls of flame,  flitted restlessly over the plain, like the disembodied souls whose  homes were here one short week before, searching for their scattered  treasures. Over on Galveston Island, a long line of flame, mounting to  the heavens, marked the burning of ruined homes and corpses; while other  fires, in all directions on the mainland, told of similar ghastly  cremations. At one time I counted twenty-three of these fires, not  including those on the island. Early in the morning a strange odor drew  attention to a fresh funeral-pyre, only a few rods away, around the  horse-shoe curve of the shore. We were told that thirty bodies, found  since daybreak in the immediate vicinity, were being consumed in it.  That peculiar smell of burning flesh, so sickening at first, became  horribly familiar within the next two months, when we lived in it and  breathed it, day after day.    \"We found the situation in Galveston infinitely worse than had been  described. The most sensational accounts of the yellowest journals fell  far short of the truth--simply because its full horror was beyond the  power of words to portray. Figures and statistics can give little idea  of the results of such an appalling calamity; and to this day, people  at a distance have no realization of the unutterable woe which our Red  Cross band of less than a dozen, strove to alleviate. We arrived on the  eighth day after the tragedy, in which upward of ten thousand lives went  suddenly out in storm and darkness; and the survivors were just  beginning to realize the extent of their losses.    \"At first they seemed stunned to partial insensibility by the very  magnitude of their grief--as a man who has been mangled almost unto  death in a railroad disaster is said to be oblivious to pain. Dead  citizens lay by thousands amid the wreck of their homes, and raving  maniacs searched the _debris_ for their loved ones, with the organized  gangs of workers. Corpses, dumped by barge-loads into the Gulf, came  floating back to menace the living; and the nights were lurid with  incinerations of putrefying bodies, piled like cord-wood, black and  white together, irrespective of age, sex, or previous condition. At  least four thousand dwellings had been swept away, with all their  contents, and fully half of the population of the city was without  shelter, food, clothes, or any of the necessaries of life. Of these,  some were living in tents; others crowded in with friends hardly less  unfortunate; many half-crazed, wandering aimlessly about the streets,  and the story of their sufferings, mental and physical, is past the  telling. Every house that remained was a house of mourning. Of many  families every member had been swept away. Even sadder were the numerous  cases where one or two were left out of recently happy households; and  saddest of all was the heart-breaking suspense of those whose friends  were numbered among the 'missing.'    \"We find it hard enough to lay away our dead in consecrated ground, with  all the care and tenderness that love can suggest, where we may water  the sacred spot with our tears and place upon it the flowers they loved  in life; but never to know whether their poor bodies were swallowed by  the merciless Gulf, or fed to the fishes with those grewsome  barge-loads, or left above ground to become an abomination in the  nostrils of the living, or burned in indiscriminate heaps with horses  and dogs and the mingled ashes scattered to the winds--must indeed have  been well-nigh unbearable. No wonder there were lunatics in Galveston,  and unnumbered cases of nervous prostration.    \"After weeks had passed and two thousand men, aided by several hundred  teams, had partially reduced the mountain of wreckage, cremation fires  yet burned continuously--fed not only by human bodies, but by thousands  of carcasses of domestic animals. By that time, in the hot, moist  atmosphere of the latitude, decomposition had so far advanced that the  corpses--which at first were decently carried in carts or on stretchers,  then shoveled upon boards or blankets--had finally to be scooped up with  pitchforks, in the hands of negroes, kept at their awful task by the  soldiers' bayonets. And still the 'finds' continued, at the average rate  of seventy a day. The once beautiful driving beach was strewn with  mounds and trenches, holding unrecognized and uncoffined victims of the  flood; and between this improvised cemetery and a ridge of _debris_,  three miles long and in places higher than the houses had been, a line  of cremation fires poisoned the air.    \"I think it was during our sixth week in Galveston, when, happening to  pass one of these primitive crematories, I stopped to interview the man  in charge. Boards, water-soaked mattresses, rags of blankets and  curtains, part of a piano, baby-carriages, and the framework of  sewing-machines, piled on top, gave it the appearance of a festive  bonfire, and only the familiar odor betrayed its purpose.    \"'Have you burned any bodies here?' I inquired. The custodian regarded  me with a stare that plainly said, 'Do you think I am doing this for  amusement?' and shifted his quid from cheek to cheek before replying.    \"'Ma'am,' said he, 'this 'ere fire's been goin' on more'n a month. To my  knowledge, upwards of sixty bodies have been burned in it--to say  nothin' of dogs, cats, hens, and three cows.'    \"'What is in there now?' I asked.    \"'Wa'al,' said he meditatively, 'it takes a corpse several days to burn  all up. I reckon thar's a couple of dozen of 'em--jest bones, you  know--down near the bottom. Yesterday we put seven on top of this 'ere  pile, and by now they are only what you might call baked. To-day we have  been working over there (pointing to other fires a quarter of a mile  distant), where we found a lot of 'em, 'leven under one house. We have  put only two in here to-day. Found 'em just now, right in that puddle.'    \"'Could you tell me who they are?' I asked.    \"'Lord! No,' was the answer. 'We don't look at 'em any more'n we have  to, else we'd been dead ourselves before to-day. One of these was a  colored man. They are all pretty black, now; but you can tell 'em by the  kinky hair. He had nothin' but an undershirt and one shoe. The other was  a woman; young, I reckon. 'Tenny rate she was tall and slim and had lots  of long brown hair. She wore a blue silk skirt and there was a rope tied  around her waist, as if somebody had tried to save her.'    \"Taking a long pole he prodded an air-hole"]]]
