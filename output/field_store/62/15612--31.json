Grant still felt confident; though he had seen the worst in the rear  as well as the best at the front. Two of his brand-new battalions,  the very men who afterwards fought like heroes, when they had learned  the soldier's work, now ran like hares. \"During the day,\" says Grant,  \"I rode back as far as the river and met General Buell, who had  just arrived. There probably were as many as four or five thousand  stragglers lying under cover of the river bluff, panic-stricken. As  we left the boat Buell's attention was attracted by these men. I  saw him berating them and trying to shame them into joining their  regiments. He even threatened them with shells from the gunboats  nearby. But all to no effect. Most of these men afterward proved  themselves as gallant as any of those who saved the battle from  which they had deserted.\"    By half-past five, after twelve hours' fighting, Grant at last  succeeded in forming a new and shorter line, a mile behind that  morning's front, but without any dangerous gaps. There were three  reorganized divisions--Sherman's, McClernand's, and Hurlbut's, one  fresh division under Nelson, and a strong land battery of over  twenty field guns helping the two ironclad gunboats in the defense  of Pittsburg Landing. The Confederate effectives, reduced by heavy  losses and by as many stragglers as the Federals, were now faced  by five thousand fresh men on guard at the Landing. Beauregard,  who had succeeded Johnston, then stopped the battle for the day,  with the idea of retiring next morning to Corinth. But, before  his orders reached it, his battle-worn right made a desperate,  fruitless, and costly attack on the immensely strengthened Landing.    That night the rain came down in torrents; and the Confederates  sought shelter in the tents the Federals had abandoned. They found  little rest there, being harassed all through the bleak dark by  the big shells that the gunboats threw among them.    At dawn Grant, now reinforced by twenty-five thousand fresh men under  Buell and Lew Wallace, took the offensive. Beauregard, hopelessly  outnumbered and without a single fresh man, retired on Corinth,  magnificently covered by Bragg's rearguard, which held the Federals  back for hours near the crucial point of Shiloh Church.    Shiloh was the fiercest battle ever fought in the River War. The  losses were over ten thousand a side in killed and wounded; while a  thousand Confederates and three thousand Federals were captured. It  was a Confederate failure; but hardly the kind of victory the Federals  needed just then, before the consummate triumph of Farragut at New  Orleans. It brought together Federal forces that the Confederates  could not possibly withstand, even on their new line east from Memphis.  But it did not raise the Federal, or depress the Confederate, morale.      Four days after the battle Halleck arrived at Pittsburg Landing  and took command of the combined armies. He was soon reinforced  by Pope; whereupon he divided the whole into right and left wings,  center, and reserve, each under its own commander. Grant was made  second in command of the whole. But, as Halleck dealt directly  with his other immediate subordinates, Grant simply became the  fifth wheel of the Halleckian slow-coach, which, after twenty days  of preparation, began, with most elaborate precautions, its crawl  toward Corinth.    Grant's position became so nearly unbearable that he applied more  than once for transfer to some other place. But this was refused.  So he strove to do his impossible duty till the middle of July,  when his punishment for Shiloh was completed by his promotion to  command a depleted remnant of Halleck's Grand Army. It is not by  any means the least of Grant's claims to real greatness that, as  a leader, he was able to survive his most searching trials: the  surprise at Shiloh, the misunderstandings and arrest that followed  Shiloh, the slur of being made a fifth-wheel second-in-command,  the demoralizing strain of that \"most anxious period of the war\"  when his depleted forces were thrown back on the defensive, and  the eight discouraging months of Sisyphean offensive which preceded  his triumph at Vicksburg. No one who has not been in the heart of  things with fighting fleets or armies can realize what it means  to all ranks when there is, or even is supposed to be, \"something  wrong\" with the living pivot on which the whole force turns. And  only those who have been behind the scenes of war's all-testing  drama can understand what it means for even an imagined \"failure\"  to \"come back.\"    Corinth was of immense importance to both sides, as it commanded  the rails not only east and west, from the Tennessee to Memphis,  but north and south, from the Ohio to New Orleans and Mobile. Though  New Orleans was taken by Farragut on the twenty-fifth of April, the  rails between Vicksburg and Port Hudson remained in Confederate  hands till next year; while Mobile remained so till the year after  that.    Beauregard collected all the troops he could at Corinth. Yet, even  with Van Dorn's and other reinforcements, he had only sixty thousand  effectives against Halleck's double numbers. Moreover, the loss of  three States and many battles had so shaken the Confederate forces  that they stood no chance whatever against Halleck's double numbers  in the open. All the same, Halleck burrowed slowly forward like a  mole, entrenching every night as if the respective strengths and  victories had been reversed.    After advancing nearly a mile a day Halleck closed in on Corinth.  He was so deeply entrenched that no one could tell from appearances  which side was besieging the other. Towards the end of May many  Federal railwaymen reported that empty trains could be heard running  into Corinth and full trains running out. But, as the Confederates  greeted each arriving \"empty\" with tremendous cheers, Halleck felt  sure that Beauregard was being greatly reinforced. The Confederate  bluff worked to admiration. On the twenty-sixth Beauregard issued  orders for complete evacuation on the twenty-ninth. On the thirtieth  Halleck drew up his whole grand army ready for a desperate defense  against an enemy that had already gone a full day's march away.    In the meantime the Federal flotilla had been fighting its way  down the Mississippi, under (the invalided) Foote's very capable  successor, Flag-Officer Charles Henry Davis. The Confederates had  very few naval men on the river, but many of their Mississippi  skippers were game to the death. They rammed Federal vessels on  the tenth of May at Fort Pillow, eighty miles above Memphis. Eight  of their fighting craft were strongly built and heavily armored,  though very deficient in speed. The Federal flotilla was very well  manned by first-class naval ratings, and was reinforced early in  June by seven fast new rams, commanded by their designer, Colonel  Charles Ellet, a famous civil engineer.    At sunrise on the lovely sixth of June the Federal flotilla, having  overcome the Confederate posts farther north and being joined by  Ellet's rams, lay near Memphis. The Confederates came upstream to  the attack, expecting to ram the gunboats in the stern as they  had at Fort Pillow. But Ellet suddenly darted down on the eight  Confederate ironclads, caught one of them on the broadside, sank  her, and disabled two others. The action then became general. The  overmatched Confederates kept up a losing battle for more than an  hour, in full view of many thousands of ardent Southerners ashore.  The scene, at its height, was appalling. The smoke, belching black  from the funnels and white from the guns, made a suffocating pall  overhead; while the dark, squat, hideous ironclad hulls seemed to  have risen from a submarine inferno to stab each other with livid  tongues of flame--so deadly close the two flotillas fought. When  the awful hour was over the Confederates were not only defeated but  destroyed; and a wail went up from the thousands of their anguished  friends, as if the very shores were mourning.      For the next month Grant held the command at Memphis. Then, on  the eleventh of July, Halleck was recalled to Washington as  General-in-Chief of the whole army; while Pope was transferred to  Virginia. The Federal invasion of Virginia under that \"Young Napoleon,\"  McClellan, had not been a success against Lee and Stonewall Jackson.  Nor did it improve with Pope at the front and Halleck in the rear,  as we shall presently see; though Halleck had declared that Pope's  operations at Island Number Ten were destined to immortal fame, and  Pope himself admitted his own greatness in sundry proclamations  to the world.    The campaign now entered its second phase. The Virginian wing (of  the whole front reaching from the Mississippi to the sea) was checked  this summer; and was to remain more or less checked for many a long  day. The river wing, under the general direction of Halleck, had  also reached its limit for '62 about the same time, after having  conquered Kentucky and western Tennessee as well as the Mississippi  down to Memphis.    This river wing was now depleted of some excellent troops and again  divided into quite separate commands. Buell commanded the Army  of the Ohio. Grant commanded his own Army of the Tennessee and  Rosecrans's Army of the Mississippi. Buell's scene of action lay  between the tributary streams--Ohio, Cumberland, and Tennessee--with  Chattanooga as his ultimate objective. Grant's scene of action  lay along the southward rails and Mississippi, with Vicksburg as  his ultimate objective.

Against these crimes it had nothing to place,  except that it had permitted the employment of the captured Bechuanas,  as indentured labourers[39]--its sole merit, in the opinion of the  Bond journal. _The Cape Times_, on the other hand, declared with equal  frankness that the real point to be decided was, whether the interests  of President Krueger and the South African Republic, or those of the  Cape Colony, as part of the British Empire, had the greater claim upon  the Government and Parliament of the Colony. And Mr. Schreiner, when,  on June 13th, he introduced the \"no confidence\" motion, asked the  House to condemn the Ministry on the ground that it had not shown any  \"sympathy\" with, or made any \"conciliatory approach\" towards, the  \"sister Republic.\" On Monday, June 20th, the second reading of the  Redistribution Bill was carried by a majority of seven, but two days  later, June 22nd, the Ministry found itself in a minority of five on  Mr. Schreiner's motion of \"no confidence.\"[40] In these circumstances  Sir Gordon Sprigg determined not to resign, but to appeal to the  electorate--a course justified by constitutional usage--and Parliament  was dissolved.             [Footnote 39: These were prisoners taken in the suppression           of the revolt in Bechuanaland in 1897.]             [Footnote 40: The little group of six, of which Sir James           Innes was the head--including Sir R. Solomon and four           others--voted _with_ the Ministry for the Redistribution           Bill, but _against_ it on the \"no confidence\" motion (with           the exception of Sir James himself). Also one moderate           Bondsman voted for \"redistribution,\" but went against the           Ministry on the \"no confidence\" motion.]    [Sidenote: The general election, 1898.]    The election which ensued was fought with great determination and no  little bitterness. Both the Progressive party and the Bond were  supplied with ample funds; the former had the purse of Mr. Rhodes and  other Englishmen to draw upon, while the latter was subsidised by  President Krueger and his agents from the revenues of the  Transvaal.[41] Mr. Schreiner's election utterances were studiously  moderate; indeed, his letter of thanks to the electors of the  Malmesbury division, by whom he was returned to Parliament, contained  a reference to \"the noble empire which was theirs, and to which they  belonged.\" But such pronouncements by no means represented the  sentiment of the party with which he had identified himself. The  objects of the Afrikander party, as presented in their most attractive  form by _Ons Land_, were to overthrow Rhodes and all his works, to  oppose the \"Chartered clique\" and \"the influence of Mammon in  politics,\" and to secure a \"pure administration\" and \"the cultivation  of friendly relations with the neighbouring states:\" in other words,  to give every possible encouragement to the Transvaal in the  diplomatic struggle with Great Britain. The Dutch press in general  preached the creed of Afrikander nationalism without disguise. The  under-current of anti-British feeling which prevailed among the Dutch  population may be understood from the fact that the following frank  appeal from a republican nationalist to the Cape Afrikanders was  published in the columns of _Ons Land_:             [Footnote 41: Mr. Rhodes was opposed at Barkly West by a           candidate financed from Pretoria.]         \"When one considers the state of affairs in the Cape Colony, it       must be confessed the future does not appear too rosy. The       majority of the Afrikander nation in the Cape Colony still go       bent under the English yoke. The free section of the two       Republics is very small compared to that portion subject to the       stranger, and, whatever may be our private opinion, one thing at       least is certain, namely, that without the assistance of the Cape       Colonial Afrikanders the Afrikander cause is lost. The two       Republics by themselves, surrounded as they are by the stranger       [_i.e._ British] are unable to continue the fight. One day the       question of who is to be master will have to be referred to the       arbitrament of the sword, and then the verdict will depend upon       the Cape Colonial Afrikanders. If they give evidence on our side       we shall win. It does not help a brass farthing to mince matters.       This is the real point at issue; and in this light every       Afrikander must learn to see it. And what assistance can we       expect from Afrikanders in the Cape Colony?... The vast majority       of them (Afrikanders) are still faithful, and will even gird on       the sword when God's time comes.\"[42]             [Footnote 42: As translated in _South Africa_, October 15th,           1898.]    At the same period the Dutch Reformed Church in the Colony had become  what was, to all intents and purposes, a vehicle for the advocacy of  rebellion. The manner in which the principles of Afrikander  nationalism were combined with religious doctrine may be gathered from  certain extracts from the _Studenten Blad_ of the Theological Seminary  of Burghersdorp, which were translated and published by _The Albert  Times_. The passage following appeared on May 26th, 1899; and by  November 16th the Seminary was closed, since the bulk of the students  had at that date joined the Boer forces:    [Sidenote: Anti-british sentiment.]         \"Must we love this people [the English] who robbed our ancestors       of their freedom, who forced them to leave a land dear to them as       their heart's blood--a people that followed our fathers to the       new fatherland which they had bought with their blood and       snatched from the barbarians, and again threatened their freedom?       Our fathers fought with the courage of despair, and retook the       land with God's aid and with their blood. But England is not       satisfied. Again is our freedom threatened by the same people,       and not only our freedom, but our language, our nationality, our       religion! Must we surrender everything, and disown our fathers? I       cannot agree with this. The thought is hateful to me--the thought       of trampling on the bodies of our fathers as we extend the hand       of friendship to those who have slain our fathers in an       unrighteous quarrel.... But some may say that the Bible teaches       us to love our enemies. I think, however, that the text cannot be       here applied. Race hatred is something quite distinct from       personal enmity. When I meet an Englishman as a private       individual I must regard him as my fellow-creature; if, however,       I meet him as an Englishman, then I, as an Afrikander, must       regard him as the enemy of my nation and my religion--as a wolf       that is endeavouring to creep into the fold. This is the chief       reason why we must regard them as our enemies; they are the       enemies of our religion.\"    At the beginning of September, when the bulk of the elections were  over, 40 Afrikander members and 36 Progressives had been returned.  Three seats remained to be filled. Mr. Rhodes, who had been returned  both for Barkly West and Namaqualand, decided to sit for the former  constituency, and the decision of the Bond to contest the seat thus  vacated caused a delay in the new election for Namaqualand. The return  of the two representatives of the Vryburg division was not to take  place until the 15th. As all three constituencies were expected to  elect Progressives--an expectation which was fulfilled--the result of  the general election was to give the Bond a bare majority of one, and  this in spite of the fact that a considerably larger total of votes  had been cast for the Progressive than for the Bond candidates.[43]             [Footnote 43: In a house of 79, 40 Afrikander and 39           Progressive members were returned. A very careful and           reliable calculation showed that, of an aggregate of 82,304           votes polled, 44,403 were cast for Progressive, and 37,901           for Afrikander candidates. More than this, while no           Progressive member was returned by a majority of less than           137, three Afrikanders won their seats by respective           majorities, of two, ten, and twenty. The Progressives,           therefore, were entitled, on their aggregate vote, to a           majority of six.]    [Sidenote: Milner's impartiality.]    These somewhat unusual circumstances gave rise to an incident which is  significant of the absolute impartiality with which Lord Milner  discharged the duties of his office as constitutional Governor of the  Cape Colony. In view of the circumstance that the Progressives had  polled a majority of the electorate, although they were actually in a  minority in the Assembly, Mr. Rhodes was of opinion that the Ministry  should remain in office, and postpone the meeting of Parliament until  the Namaqualand election had been held. He believed, further, that in  the period of grace thus obtained it would be found possible to induce  one or other of the Bond members to change sides, and thereby put the  Ministry again in a majority. The immediate obstacle to the execution  of this plan of action was the necessity of obtaining \"supply.\" The  partial appropriation made by Parliament before the dissolution was  exhausted, and the only method by which funds could be provided  without the authority of Parliament was the issue of Governor's  warrants on the Treasury. Lord Milner was willing to sign warrants to  enable the Ministry to carry on the administration during the  unavoidable interval between the exhaustion of the last appropriation  and the commencement of the new session. But, in view of the  constitutional principle that no ministry which cannot obtain supply  is justified in remaining in office, he"]]]
