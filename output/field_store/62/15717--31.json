If  he should manage to claim the attention of that woman, what a tremendous  triumph!          CHAPTER VI    THE VOICE OF THE SIREN      Don Jose, firm friend of the Marquis of Moraima, and related to the best  families of Seville, had often talked to Gallardo concerning Dona Sol.    She had returned to Seville only a few months before, arousing the  enthusiasm of the young people. She came, after a long absence in  foreign lands, eager for everything pertaining to _la tierra_, enjoying  the popular customs and finding it all very interesting, \"very  artistic.\" She went to the bull-fights arrayed in the ancient costume of  a _maja_, imitating the dress and pose of the beautiful women painted by  Goya. Strong, accustomed to sports, and a great horsewoman, the people  saw her galloping around the outskirts of Seville, wearing with her  black riding skirt a man's jacket, a red cravat, and a white beaver hat  perched on top of her golden hair. Sometimes she carried a spear across  the pommel of the saddle and with a party of friends converted into  _piqueros_, she went to the pasture grounds to tease and upset bulls,  enjoying this wild festivity, abounding as it did in danger. She was not  a child. Gallardo had a confused recollection of having seen her in his  youth on the _paseo_ of Delicias, seated beside her mother and covered  with white frills, like a luxurious doll in a show-case, while he, a  miserable vagabond, dashed under the wheels of the carriage in search of  cigar stubs. They were undoubtedly the same age,--she must be at the  end of the twenties; but how magnificent! So different from other women!  She seemed like an exotic bird, a bird of paradise, fallen into a  farmyard among mere shiny, well fed hens.    Don Jose knew her history. An eccentric mind had Dona Sol! Her mother  was dead and she had a considerable fortune. She had married in Madrid a  certain man older than herself, who offered to a woman eager for  splendor and novelty the advantages of travelling about the world as the  wife of an ambassador who represented Spain at the principal courts.    \"The way that girl has amused herself, Juan!\" said the manager. \"The  heads she has turned in ten years from one end of Europe to the other!  She must be a regular geography with secret notes at the foot of each  page. Surely she cannot look at the map without making a little cross of  memory near all the great capitals. And the poor ambassador! He died, of  despondency, no doubt, because there was no longer any place to which he  could be sent. The good gentleman, accredited to represent our country,  would go to a court and inside of a year, behold! the queen or the  empress of that land was writing to Spain asking the minister to retire  the ambassador and his dreaded consort, whom the newspapers called 'the  irresistible Spanish woman.' The crowned heads that _gachi_ has turned!  Queens trembled when they saw her come, as if she were the Asiatic  cholera. At last the poor ambassador saw no other place for his talents  but the republics of America, but as he was a gentleman of good  principles and the friend of kings, he preferred to die. And don't think  that the girl contented herself only with personages who eat and dance  in royal palaces. Not if what they say be true! That child is all  extremes; it is all or nothing! She will as soon go after one that digs  in the ground as the highest above it. I have heard that there in Russia  she was running after one of those bushy-haired fellows that throw  bombs, a youth with a woman's face, who paid no attention to her because  she disturbed him in his business. But the girl kept chasing and chasing  after him until finally they hung him. They say, too, that she had an  affair with a painter in Paris, and they even say he painted her in the  nude, with one arm over her face so as not to be recognized, and that  the picture travels around that way on match-boxes. That must be false;  an exaggeration! What seems more certain is that she was the great  friend of a German, a musician--one of those who write operas. If thou  couldst hear her play the piano! And when she sings! Just like one of  those singers that come to the theatre of San Fernando in the Easter  season. And think not that she sings in Italian only; she talks  anything--French, German, English. Her uncle, the Marquis of Moraima,  when he talks about her at the Forty-five says he has his suspicions  that she speaks Latin. What a woman! Eh, Juanillo? What an interesting  creature!    \"In Seville,\" he went on, \"she leads an exemplary life. On that account  I think what they tell of her foreign affairs may be false; lies of  certain young cocks that go for grapes and find them sour.\"    And laughing at the spirit of this woman, who at times was as bold and  as aggressive as a man, he repeated the rumors that had circulated in  certain clubs on Sierpes Street. When the \"Ambassadress\" came to live in  Seville, all the young people had formed a court around her.    \"Imagine, Juanillo, an elegant woman, different from those around here,  bringing her clothes and hats from Paris, her perfume from London;  besides being a friend of kings, branded with the brand of the finest  stock in Europe, so to speak. They followed in her wake like mad men,  and the girl permitted them certain liberties, wanting to live among  them like a man. But some of them transgressed the bounds, mistaking  familiarity for something else, and, at a loss for words, they made too  free with their hands. Then there were blows, Juan, and something worse.  That young lady is dangerous. It seems that she shoots at a mark, that  she knows how to box like an English sailor, and knows besides, that  Japanese way of fighting that they call _jitsu_. To sum it all up, if a  Christian dares to give her a pinch, she, with her dainty little fists,  without even getting angry, will grasp thee and leave thee torn to  shreds. Now they attack her less, but she has enemies who go about  talking evil of her; some praising what is a lie, others even denying  that she is clever.\"    Dona Sol, according to the manager, was enthusiastic over life in  Seville. After a long sojourn in cold, foggy lands she admired the  intensely blue sky and the winter sun of soft gold, and she discoursed  on the sweetness of life in this country--_so picturesque!_    \"The simplicity of our customs fills her with enthusiasm. She is like  one of those English women that come in Holy Week--as if she had not  been born in Seville; as if she saw it for the first time! They say she  spends her summers in foreign cities and her winters here. She is tired  of her life in palaces and courts, and if thou didst but see the people  she goes with! She has made them receive her like a sister in the  convent of Cristo de Triana and that of the Most Holy Cachorro, and she  has spent a pot of money on wine for the brotherhood. Some nights she  fills her house with guitarists and dancers, for so many girls in  Seville are good singers and dancers. With them go their teachers and  their families, even to their most distant relatives; they all stuff  themselves with olives, sausages, and wine, and Dona Sol, seated in a  big chair like a queen, spends the hours demanding dance after dance,  all which must be native to the country. They say this is a diversion  equal to that which was given to I don't know what king, who had operas  sung for himself alone. Her servants, foreign fellows that have come  with her, long-faced and serious as parrots, go about in their evening  dress with great trays, passing glasses to the dancers who in plain  sight box their ears and snap olive stones in their eyes. Most honest  and diverting games! Now, Dona Sol receives Lechuzo in the mornings, an  old gypsy who gives guitar lessons, master of the purest style; and when  her visitors don't find her with the instrument on her lap, she is with  an orange in her hand. The oranges that creature has eaten since she  came! And still she isn't satisfied!\"    Thus continued Don Jose, explaining to his _matador_ the eccentricities  of Dona Sol.    Four days after Gallardo had seen her in the parish church of San  Lorenzo, the manager approached the _matador_ in a _cafe_ on Sierpes  Street with an air of mystery.    \"_Gacho_, thou art a child of good fortune. Knowest who has been talking  to me about thee?\"    And putting his mouth close to the bull-fighter's ear he whispered,  \"Dona Sol!\"    She had asked him about his _matador_, and expressed a desire to meet  him. She was such an original type! So Spanish!    \"She says she has seen thee kill several times, once in Madrid and  again, I know not where. She has applauded thee. She recognizes that  thou are very brave. What if she should take up with thee! Imagine it!  What an honor! Thou wouldst be a brother-in-law, or something like that,  of all the high-toned fellows on the European calendar of swells.\"    Gallardo smiled modestly, lowering his eyes, but at the same time he  twisted his handsome person proudly as if he did not consider his  manager's hypothesis either difficult or extraordinary.    \"But do not form illusions, Juanillo,\" continued he; \"Dona Sol wishes to  study a bull-fighter at close range, with the same interest that she  takes lessons from the master Lechuzo. Local color and nothing more!  'Bring him day after to-morrow to Tablada,' she told me. Thou knowest  what that will be--a baiting of the cattle of the Moraima herd; an  entertainment the Marquis has gotten up to divert his niece. We will go;  she has invited me also.\"    Two days later, in the afternoon, the _maestro_ and his manager started  from the ward of the Feria like gentlemen _picadores_, eagerly watched  by the people who peeped out of the doors and stood in groups on the  sidewalks.    \"They are going to Tablada,\" "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33830"],[0,"Fur Farming (#20)"],[1,"FARMING.    The chief obstacle to profitable propagation of deer in the United  States is the restrictive character of State laws governing the killing,  sale, and transportation of game. Many of the States, following  precedent, lay down the broad rule that all the game animals in the  State, whether resident or migratory, are the property of the State. A  few States except game animals that are \"under private ownership legally  acquired.\" A few others encourage private ownership by providing a way  in which wild animals--deer and the like--may be captured for  domestication. Generally, when private ownership of game is recognized  by law, the right to kill such game is granted, but the owner is  hampered by the same regulations as to season, sale, and shipment that  apply to wild game. One by one, however, State legislatures are coming  to recognize the interests of game propagators, and game laws are  gradually being modified in accordance with the change of view.    The chief source from which deer and elk may be obtained for stocking  preserves is from animals already in captivity. These must be  transported from place to place or there can be no commerce in them, yet  the laws of many States absolutely forbid their shipment. The laws as to  possession and transportation of deer carcasses make the shipping of  venison also illegal. General export of venison is legal from only six  of the States, and three of these have no wild deer left to protect.    The laws concerning the season for killing and the sale of deer are  often equally embarrassing to those who would produce venison for  profit. The owner of domesticated deer can not legally kill his animals  except in open season. Owners of private preserves are similarly  restricted and are limited to the killing of one or two animals in a  season. More than half the States and territories absolutely forbid the  sale of venison. A few forbid the sale of venison produced within the  State, but permit the sale of that imported from other States, a most  unjust discrimination against home industry.    The following States have recently modified their laws so as to provide,  under regulations, for the sale of deer from private preserves.  Transportation and even export are included in some of them.    ARKANSAS.--Possession, sale, and shipment of deer or fawns is permitted  when they have been raised in captivity for domestic purposes and are  accompanied by an affidavit from the raiser.    COLORADO.--Owners of private preserves under a license are permitted to  sell and ship deer or other quadrupeds that are accompanied by an  invoice. A fee is required for each animal sold.    ILLINOIS.--Any person who raises deer for market may kill and sell them  at any time in the same manner as other domestic animals.    INDIANA.--The provisions of the law as to possession and sale do not  apply to persons who have under ownership or control any deer raised in  a deer park.    MASSACHUSETTS.--The owner may sell his own tame deer kept on his own  grounds.    MINNESOTA.--Persons who desire to domesticate deer, moose, elk, or  caribou may secure a permit to do so from the State board of game and  fish commissioners by paying a fee of 50 cents for each animal in  captivity and a like fee for each animal added later by natural increase  or otherwise. The animals kept in captivity may be sold or shipped  within or without the State, by permission of the commissioners.    MISSOURI.--Deer or elk, alive or dead, may be shipped from any private  preserve and sold in the markets of the State when accompanied by a tag  furnished by the game warden of the county, showing whose property it  is, where killed and to whom shipped.    NEW HAMPSHIRE.--The Blue Mountain Forest Association may kill elk, deer,  or moose in their preserve for one month after the open season, and at  any time may transport them outside the State.    NEW YORK.--Deer may be sold during the open season; and moose, elk,  caribou, and antelope from private parks may be sold during the same  period. Common carriers may transport animals into the State for  breeding purposes, but may not transport venison unless it is  accompanied by the owner.    NORTH CAROLINA.--Seventeen counties permit the owner and keeper of an  inclosed game preserve, who raises deer for use or sale, to kill, sell,  or use those raised or kept in said inclosure.    PENNSYLVANIA.--Owners of game preserves who hold a game propagating  certificate may sell and transport deer or fawn alive for propagating  purposes only, after securing the written consent of the president of  the board of game commissioners.    In three or four other States game \"under private ownership, legally  acquired,\" is supposed to be exempt from general provisions of the game  law; but in a test case as to its sale or export it is doubtful whether  the courts would so hold without more specific provision legalizing such  commerce.      SUMMARY.    The domestication of deer and elk offers an interesting field for  experiment, as well as remunerative returns for the investment of  capital.    The wapiti and the Virginia deer can be raised successfully and cheaply  under many different conditions of food and climate. The production of  venison and the rearing of both species for stocking parks may be made  profitable industries in the United States.    Instead of hampering breeders by restrictions, as at present, State laws  should be so modified as to encourage the raising of deer, elk, and  other animals as a source of profit to the individual and to the State.    Safeguards against the destruction and sale of wild deer in place of  domesticated deer are not difficult to enforce. For this purpose a  system of licensing private parks, and of tagging deer or carcases sold  or shipped, so that they may be easily identified, is recommended.    It is believed that with favorable legislation much otherwise waste land  in the United States may be utilized for the production of venison so as  to yield profitable returns, and also that this excellent and nutritious  meat, instead of being denied to 99 per cent of the population of the  country, may become as common and as cheap in our markets as mutton.           *       *       *       *       *    [Illustration: The above illustration shows the front cover of  Hunter-Trader-Trapper, a monthly magazine, published by The A.
