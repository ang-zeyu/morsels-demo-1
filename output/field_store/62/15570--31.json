The Dominican Friars still wear the  amice on the head when approaching the altar at mass.    Sets of vestments often had copes belonging to them. The cope was  required not only for use when censing altars at choir services, but  also for the celebrant in the procession which (like our Litany)  preceded the principal celebration of the Eucharist on Sundays.    [36] Fannelles = fanons or maniples.    [37] Cloth of gold.    [38] Hangings for lecterns.    [39] Probably the last Prior, alias Linstede.    [40] \"Work-day vestments\" means vestments for use on weekdays at low  masses.    [41] A vestment with a Latin cross on the back of the chasuble; these  were common in England in the sixteenth century.    [42] _Vide_ the design on the coffin-lid now preserved in the North  Transept (p. 89).    [43] A small banner which was hung on the processional cross.    [44] Probably curtains for hanging behind the rood.    [45] Canopies for hanging above the pyx, which contained the reserved  Sacrament, and was, as usual in England, suspended over the high altar.  N.B.--The Roman form of altar-tabernacle seldom if ever seems to have  been used in England.    [46] Burses, to keep the corporals in.    [47] The \"table of the high altar\" was the reredos, only exposed on  high days, this cloth or upper frontal concealing it at other times.  The reredos must not be confused with the great altar screen: it was  quite small, and was immediately at the back of the altar itself.    [48] \"Hangings for altars above and beneath\" include frontals and upper  frontals, the latter taking the place of the reredos, or being used to  cover it at ordinary times. Some of these hangings may be \"riddels\" or  curtains to hang at the ends of the altar. These used to hang at right  angles to the reredos, and close to the altar ends.    [49] _I.e._, a funeral pall.    [50] Shamrock or trefoil.    [51] A cushion to lay the altar book upon. Such cushions were often  very rich and handsome, and in the days of large books and fine  bindings were almost necessary. They were much more general than desks.    [52] _I.e._, a frontal; the same word is used in the Canon of 1603,  which orders a frontal.    [53] Four great standard candlesticks to stand on the pavement before  the altar. Large churches often had more than two standard lights. The  pair of small standards (the next entry) were probably for one of the  lesser altars.    [54] Probably included under \"Latten\" by mistake or carelessness.    [55] _Ibid._    [56] _Ibid._    [57] This ornament was used in one or two processions when the Holy  Eucharist was carried. The \"burrall\" is the glass in the middle wherein  the Sacrament was placed. Only rich churches possessed this ornament,  which was of very late introduction. It is needless to add that the  still more modern service of Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament was  never in use in England.    [58] Probably to stand on the high altar.    [59] Perhaps held a relic.    [60] To stand on the high altar for ornament.    [61] Two censers were commonly carried side by side in procession in  England.    [62] Incense-boat.    [63] The \"maser\" is quoted as \"given to the Wardens when they meet to  drink on.\"          V    SPECIFICATION OF THE ORGAN    (Furnished by the builders, Messrs.
