[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3421"],[0,"Bramble-Bees and Others (#20)"],[1," necessarily begin here, because this corner is  the rear-most part of the tube. The foremost gallery is wide, with an  entrance-door on the front of the hive. Here, finding the conditions to  which she is accustomed, the mother will go on with her laying in the  order which she prefers.    Let us now see what has happened. Of the fifty-two double galleried  tubes, about a third did not have their narrow passage colonized. The  Osmia closed its aperture communicating with the large passage; and the  latter alone received the eggs. This waste of space was inevitable.  The female Osmiae, though nearly always larger than the males, present  marked differences among one another: some are bigger, some are smaller.  I had to adjust the width of the narrow galleries to Bees of average  dimensions. It may happen therefore that a gallery is too small to admit  the large-sized mothers to whom chance allots it. When the Osmia is  unable to enter the tube, obviously she will not colonize it. She then  closes the entrance to this space which she cannot use and does her  laying beyond it, in the wide tube. Had I tried to avoid these useless  apparatus by choosing tubes of larger calibre, I should have encountered  another drawback: the medium-sized mothers, finding themselves almost  comfortable, would have decided to lodge females there. I had to be  prepared for it: as each mother selected her house at will and as I was  unable to interfere in her choice, a narrow tube would be colonized or  not, according as the Osmia who owned it was or was not able to make her  way inside.    There remain some forty pairs of tubes with both galleries colonized. In  these there are two things to take into consideration. The narrow  rear tubes of 5 or 5 1/2 millimetres (.195 to.214 inch.--Translator's  Note.)--and these are the most numerous--contain males and males only,  but in short series, between one and five. The mother is here so much  hampered in her work that they are rarely occupied from end to end; the  Osmia seems in a hurry to leave them and to go and colonize the front  tube, whose ample space will leave her the liberty of movement necessary  for her operations. The other rear tubes, the minority, whose diameter  is about 6 millimetres (.234 inch.--Translator's Note.), contain  sometimes only females and sometimes females at the back and males  towards the opening. One can see that a tube a trifle wider and a mother  slightly smaller would account for this difference in the results.  Nevertheless, as the necessary space for a female is barely provided  in this case, we see that the mother avoids as far as she can a two-sex  arrangement beginning with males and that she adopts it only in the  last extremity. Finally, whatever the contents of the small tube may  be, those of the large one, following upon it, never vary and consist of  females at the back and males in front.    Though incomplete, because of circumstances very difficult to control,  the result of the experiment is none the less very striking. Twenty-five  apparatus contain only males in their narrow gallery, in numbers varying  from a minimum of one to a maximum of five. After these comes the colony  of the large gallery, beginning with females and ending with males. And  the layings in these apparatus do not always belong to late summer or  even to the intermediate period: a few small tubes contain the earliest  eggs of the Osmiae. A couple of Osmiae, more forward than the others,  set to work on the 23rd of April. Both of them started their laying by  placing males in the narrow tubes. The meagre supply of provisions was  enough in itself to show the sex, which proved later to be in accordance  with my anticipations. We see then that, by my artifices, the whole  swarm starts with the converse of the normal order. This inversion is  continued, at no matter what period, from the beginning to the end of  the operations. The series which, according to rule, would begin with  females now begins with males. Once the larger gallery is reached, the  laying is pursued in the usual order.    We have advanced one step and that no small one: we have seen that  the Osmia, when circumstances require it, is capable of reversing the  sequence of the sexes. Would it be possible, provided that the tube were  long enough, to obtain a complete inversion, in which the entire series  of the males should occupy the narrow gallery at the back and the entire  series of the females the roomy gallery in front? I think not; and I  will tell you why.    Long and narrow cylinders are by no means to the Osmia's taste, not  because of their narrowness but because of their length. Remember that  for each load of honey brought the worker is obliged to move backwards  twice. She enters, head first, to begin by disgorging the honey-syrup  from her crop. Unable to turn in a passage which she blocks entirely,  she goes out backwards, crawling rather than walking, a laborious  performance on the polished surface of the glass and a performance  which, with any other surface, would still be very awkward, as the wings  are bound to rub against the wall with their free end and are liable to  get rumpled or bent. She goes out backwards, reaches the outside, turns  round and goes in again, but this time the opposite way, so as to brush  off the load of pollen from her abdomen on to the heap. If the gallery  is at all long, this crawling backwards becomes troublesome after a  time; and the Osmia soon abandons a passage that is too small to allow  of free movement. I have said that the narrow tubes of my apparatus  are, for the most part, only very incompletely colonized. The Bee, after  lodging a small number of males in them, hastens to leave them. In the  wide front gallery, she can stay where she is and still be able to turn  round easily for her different manipulations; she will avoid those two  long journeys backwards, which are so exhausting and so bad for her  wings.    Another reason no doubt prompts her not to make too great a use of the  narrow passage, in which she would establish males, followed by females  in the part where the gallery widens. The males have to leave their  cells a couple of weeks or more before the females. If they occupy the  back of the house, they will die prisoners or else they will overturn  everything on their way out. This risk is avoided by the order which the  Osmia adopts.    In my tubes with their unusual arrangement, the mother might well find  the dilemma perplexing: there is the narrowness of the space at her  disposal and there is the emergence later on. In the narrow tubes, the  width is insufficient for the females; on the other hand, if she lodges  males there, they are liable to perish, since they will be prevented  from issuing at the proper moment. This would perhaps explain the  mother's hesitation and her obstinacy in settling females in some of my  apparatus which looked as if they could suit none but males.    A suspicion occurs to me, a suspicion aroused by my attentive  examination of the narrow tubes. All, whatever the number of their  inmates, are carefully plugged at the opening, just as separate tubes  would be. It might therefore be the case that the narrow gallery at the  back was looked upon by the Osmia not as the prolongation of the large  front gallery, but as an independent tube. The facility with which  the worker turns as soon as she reaches the wide tube, her liberty of  action, which is now as great as in a doorway communicating with the  outer air, might well be misleading and cause the Osmia to treat the  narrow passage at the back as though the wide passage in front did not  exist. This would account for the placing of the female in the large  tube above the males in the small tube, an arrangement contrary to her  custom.    I will not undertake to decide whether the mother really appreciates the  danger of my snares, or whether she makes a mistake in considering  only the space at her disposal and beginning with males. At any rate,  I perceive in her a tendency to deviate as little as possible from the  order which safeguards the emergence of the two sexes. This tendency is  demonstrated by her repugnance to colonizing my narrow tubes with long  series of males. However, so far as we are concerned, it does not matter  much what passes at such times in the Osmia's little brain. Enough for  us to know that she dislikes narrow and long tubes, not because they are  narrow, but because they are at the same time long.    And, in fact, she does very well with a short tube of the same diameter.  Such are the cells in the old nests of the Mason-bee of the Shrubs  and the empty shells of the Garden Snail. With the short tube, the two  disadvantages of the long tube are avoided. She has very little of that  crawling backwards to do when she has a Snail-shell for the home of  her eggs and scarcely any when the home is the cell of the Mason-bee.  Moreover, as the stack of cocoons numbers two or three at most, the  deliverance will be exempt from the difficulties attached to a long  series. To persuade the Osmia to nidify in a single tube long enough to  receive the whole of her laying and at the same time narrow enough  to leave her only just the possibility of admittance appears to me  a project without the slightest chance of success: the Bee would  stubbornly refuse such a dwelling or would content herself with  entrusting only a very small portion of her eggs to it. On the other  hand, with narrow but short cavities, success, without being easy,  seems to me at least quite possible. Guided by these considerations,  I embarked upon the most arduous part of my problem: to obtain the  complete or almost complete permutation of one sex with the other;  to produce a laying consisting only of males by offering the mother a  series of lodgings suited only to males.    Let us in the first place consult the old nests of the Mason-bee of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34211"],[0,"A Treatise on Physiology and Hygiene (#20)"],[1,"it separates into two distinct parts, one of  them being a dark red jelly, the coagulum, or clot, which is heavy and  sinks; and the other, a clear, straw-colored liquid, called serum, which  covers the clot. This change is dependent upon the presence in the blood of  fibrin, which possesses the property of solidifying under certain  circumstances; one of these circumstances being when the blood is separated  from living tissues. The color of the clot is due to the entanglement of  the corpuscles with the fibrin.    [Sidenote: 10. If coagulation were impossible? How is it in fact?]    10. In this law of the coagulation of the blood is our safeguard against  death by haemorrhage, or against undue loss of blood. If coagulation were  impossible, the {105} slightest injury in drawing blood would prove fatal.  Whereas now, in vastly the larger proportion of cases, bleeding ceases  spontaneously, because the blood, as it coagulates, stops the mouths of the  injured blood-vessels. In another class of cases, where larger vessels are  cut or torn, it is simply necessary to close them by a temporary pressure;  for in a few minutes the clot will form and seal them up. In still more  serious cases, where the blood-vessel is of large size, the surgeon is  obliged to tie a \"ligature\" about it, and thus prevent the force of the  blood-current from washing away the clots, which, forming within and around  the vessel, would close it effectually.    [Sidenote: 11. What is worthy of remark? Coagulation of the blood of  inferior animals? Of the blood of birds?]    11. It is worthy of remark that this peculiarity is early implanted in the  blood, even before birth, and in advance of any existing necessity for it;  thus anticipating and guarding against danger. But this is not all. Of most  of the inferior animals, which, as compared with man, are quite helpless,  the blood coagulates more rapidly, and in the case of the birds, almost  instantly. The relative composition of fluid and coagulated blood may be  thus represented:      _Fluid Blood._              _Coagulated Blood._        Plasma----------Serum---------Serum            \\             \\              --------Fibrin--------                                    \\                                     \\     Corpuscles------Corpuscles-------Clot.  [Sidenote: 12. The blood, as a provider and purifier? What uses does the  blood subserve? Experiments? Transfusion?]    12. THE USES OF THE BLOOD.--The blood is the great provider and purifier of  the body. It both carries new materials to all the tissues, and removes the  worn out particles of matter. This is effected by the plasma. It both  conveys oxygen and removes carbonic acid. This is done through the  corpuscles. Some singular experiments have {106} been tried to illustrate  the life-giving power of the blood. An animal that has bled so freely as to  be at the point of dying, is promptly brought back to life by an operation  called transfusion, by which fresh blood from a living animal is injected  into the blood-vessels of his body.    [Sidenote: 13. The case of the deaf and feeble dog? Horse? Dead dog?]    13. It is related that a dog, deaf and feeble from age, had hearing and  activity restored to him by the introduction into his veins of blood taken  from a young dog; and, that a horse, twenty-six years old, having received  the blood of four lambs acquired new vigor. And further, that a dog, just  dead from an acute disease, was so far revived by transfusion, as to be  able to stand and make a few movements.    [Sidenote: 14. Transfusion, as a fashionable remedy? What further of  transfusion?]    14. Transfusion has been practised upon man. At one time, shortly after  Harvey's discovery of the \"Circulation of the Blood,\" it became quite a  fashionable remedy, it being thought possible by it to cure all forms of  disease, and even to make the old young again. But these claims were soon  found extravagant, and many unhappy accidents occurred in its practice; so  that being forbidden by government and interdicted by the Pope, it rapidly  fell into disuse. At the present time, however, it is sometimes resorted to  in extreme cases, when there has been a great and rapid loss of blood; and  there are upon record several instances where, other means having failed,  life has been restored or prolonged by the operation of transfusion.    [Sidenote: 15. The seat of the reviving power of the blood? What further is  related?]    15. This reviving power of the blood seems to reside in the corpuscles; for  transfusion, when attempted to be performed with the serum alone, has, in  every case, proved fruitless. Now, though so much depends upon the blood  and its corpuscles, it is a mistake to suppose that in them alone is the  seat of life, or that they are, in an exclusive manner, alive. All the  organs and parts of the body are mutually dependent one upon the other; and  the complete usefulness {107} of the blood, or of any other part, flows out  of the harmonious action of all the parts.    [Sidenote: 16. Changes in the blood? What further is stated?]    16. CHANGE OF COLOR.--The blood undergoes a variety of changes in its  journey through the system. As it visits the different organs it both gives  out and takes up materials. In one place it is enriched, in another it is  impoverished. By reason of these alterations in its composition, the blood  also changes its color. In one part of the body it is bright red, or  arterial; in another it is dark blue, or venous. In the former case it is  pure and fit for the support of the tissues; in the latter, it is impure  and charged with effete materials. (The details of the change from dark to  bright will be given in the chapter on Respiration.)    [Sidenote: 17. Motion of the blood? What is meant by the circulation of the  blood? How confined? Discovery made by Harvey?]    17. CIRCULATION.--The blood is in constant motion during life. From the  heart, as a centre, a current is always setting toward the different  organs; and from these organs a current is constantly returning to the  heart. In this way a ceaseless circular movement is kept up, which is  called the Circulation of the Blood. This stream of the vital fluid is  confined to certain fixed channels, the blood-vessels. Those branching from  the heart are the arteries; those converging to it are the veins. The true  course of the blood was unknown before the beginning of the seventeenth  century. In 1619 it was discovered by the illustrious William Harvey. Like  many other great discoverers, he suffered persecution and loss, but unlike  some of them, he was fortunate enough to conquer and survive opposition. He  lived long enough to see his discovery universally accepted, and himself  honored as a benefactor of mankind.    {108}    [Illustration: FIG. 27.--THE ORGANS OF CIRCULATION.]    {109} [Illustration: FIG. 28.--THE HEART AND LARGE VESSELS.

Protection to the heart? What else is said in relation to the  heart?]    18. THE HEART.--The heart is the central engine of the circulation. In this  wonderful little organ, hardly larger than a man's fist, resides that  sleepless force by which, during the whole of life, the current of the  blood is kept in motion. It is placed in the middle and front part of the  chest, inclining to the left side. The heartbeat may be felt and heard  between the fifth and sixth ribs, near the breast-bone. The shape of the  heart is conical, with the apex or point downward and in front. The base,  which is upward, is attached so as to hold it securely in its place, while  the apex is freely moveable. In order that loss of power from friction may  be obviated, the heart is enclosed between two layers of serous membrane,  which forms a kind of sac. This membrane is as smooth as satin, and itself  secretes a fluid in sufficient quantities to keep it at all times well  lubricated. The lining membrane of the heart, likewise, is extremely  delicate and smooth.    {110} [Illustration: FIG. 29.--SECTION OF THE HEART.    A, Right Ventricle. B, Left Ventricle. C, Right Auricle. D, Left Auricle.  E, F, Inlets to the Ventricles. G, Pulmonary Artery. H, Aorta.]    [Sidenote: 19. Formation of the heart? Right and left heart?]    19. THE CAVITIES OF THE HEART.--The heart is hollow, and so partitioned as  to contain four chambers or cavities; two at the base, known as the  _auricles_, from a fancied resemblance to the ear of a dog, and two at the  apex or point, called _ventricles_. An auricle and a ventricle on the same  side, communicate with each other, but there is no opening from side to  side. It is customary to regard the heart as a double organ, and to speak  of its division into the right and left heart. For while both halves act  together in point of time, each half sustains an entirely distinct portion  of the labor of the circulation. Thus, the right heart always carries the  dark or venous blood, and the left always circulates the bright or arterial  blood.    [Sidenote: 20. Capacity of the chambers of the heart? What wise provision  is mentioned? The auricles?]    20. If we examine the heart, we at once notice that though its various  chambers have about the same capacity, the walls of the ventricles are  thicker and stronger than those of the auricles. This is a wise provision,  for it is by the powerful action of the former that the blood is forced to  the most remote regions of the body. The auricles, on the contrary, need  much less power, for they simply discharge their contents into the cavities  of the heart near at hand and below them--into the ventricles. {111}    [Sidenote: 21.
