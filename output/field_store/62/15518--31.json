Is the boat all ready?\"    \"Yes, and it's a good thing it was under shelter last night or we'd  have to bail it out now, and that would delay us.\"    An hour later they were under way, having telephoned to the engineer at  the Swift home that they were coming.  Garret Jackson reported over the  wire that he had notified the Shopton police of the robbery, but that  little could be done until the inventor arrived to give a description  of the stolen articles.    \"And that will do little good, I fear,\" remarked Tom.  \"Those fellows  have evidently been planning this for some time and will cover their  tracks well.  I'd like to catch them, not only to recover your things,  dad, but to find out the mystery of my boat and why the man took the  tank braces.\"          CHAPTER XXI    THE BALLOON ON FIRE      Down Lake Carlopa speeded the ARROW, those on board watching the banks  slip past as the motor-boat rapidly cut through the water.    \"What time do you think we ought to reach home, Tom?\" asked Mr. Swift.    \"Oh, about four o'clock, if we don't stop for lunch.\"    \"Then we'll not stop,\" decided the inventor.  \"We'll eat what we have  on board.  I suppose you have some rations?\" and he smiled, the first  time since hearing the bad news.    \"Oh, yes, Ned and I didn't eat everything on our camping trips,\" and  Tom was glad to note that the fine weather which followed the storm was  having a good effect on his father.    \"We certainly had a good time,\" remarked Ned.  \"I don't know when I've  enjoyed a vacation so.\"    \"It's too bad it had to be cut short by this robbery,\" commented Mr.  Swift.    \"Oh, well, my time would be up in a few days more,\" went on the young  bank employee.  \"It's just as well to start back now.\"    Tom took the shortest route he knew, keeping in as close to shore as he  dared, for now he was as anxious to get home as was his father.  On and  on speeded the ARROW, yet fast as it was, it seemed slow to Mr. Swift,  who, like all nervous persons, always wanted to go wherever he desired  to go instantly.    Tom headed his boat around a little point of land, and was urging the  engine to the top notch of speed, for now he was on a clear course,  with no danger from shoals or hidden rocks, when he saw, darting out  from shore, a tiny craft which somehow seemed familiar to him.  He  recognized a peculiar put-putter of the motor.    \"That's the DOT,\" he remarked in a low voice to Ned, \"Miss Nestor's  cousin's boat.\"    \"Is she in it now?\" asked Ned.    \"Yes,\" answered Tom quickly.    \"You've got good eyesight,\" remarked Ned dryly, \"to tell a girl at that  distance.  It looks to me like a boy.\"    \"No, it's Mary--I mean Miss Nestor,\" the youth quickly corrected  himself, and a close observer would have noticed that he blushed a bit  under his coat of tan.    Ned laughed, Tom blushed still more, and Mr. Swift, who was in a stern  seat, glanced up quickly.    \"It looks as if that boat wanted to hail us,\" the inventor remarked.    Tom was thinking the same thing, for, though he had changed his course  slightly since sighting the DOT, the little craft was put over so as to  meet him.  Wondering what Miss Nestor could want, but being only too  willing to have a chat with her, the young inventor shifted his helm.  In a short time the two craft were within hailing distance.    \"How do you do?\" called Miss Nestor, as she slowed down her motor.  \"Don't you think I'm improving, Mr. Swift?\"    \"What's that?  I--er--I beg your pardon, but I didn't catch that,\"  exclaimed the aged inventor quickly, coming out of a sort of day-dream.  \"I beg your pardon.\"  He thought she had addressed him.    Miss Nestor blushed and looked questioningly at Tom.    \"My father,\" he explained as he introduced his parent.  Ned needed  none, having met Miss Nestor before.  \"Indeed you have improved very  much,\" went on our hero.  \"You seem able to manage the boat all alone.\"    \"Yes, I'm doing pretty well.  Dick lets me take the DOT whenever I want  to, and I thought I'd come out for a little trial run this morning.  I'm getting ready for the races.  I suppose you are going to enter  them?\" and she steered her boat alongside Tom's, who throttled down his  powerful motor so as not to pass his friend.    \"Races?  I hadn't heard of them,\" he replied.    \"Oh, indeed there are to be fine ones under the auspices of the Lanton  Motor Club.  Mr. Hastings, of whom you bought that boat, is going to  enter his new CARLOPA, and Dick has entered the DOT, in the baby class  of course.  But I'm going to run it, and that's why I'm practicing.\"    \"I hope you win,\" remarked Tom.  \"I hadn't heard of the races, but I  think I'll enter.  I'm glad you told me.  Do you want to race now?\" and  he laughed as he looked into the brown eyes of Mary Nestor.    \"No, indeed, unless you give me a start of several miles.\"    They kept together for some little time longer, and then, as Tom knew  his father would be restless at the slow speed, he told Miss Nestor the  need of haste, and, advancing his timer, he soon left the DOT behind.  The girl called a laughing good-by and urged him not to forget the  races, which were to take place in about two weeks.    \"I suppose Andy Foger will enter his boat,\" commented Ned.    \"Naturally,\" agreed Tom.  \"It's a racer, and he'll probably think it  can beat anything on the lake.  But if he doesn't manage his motor  differently, it won't.\"    The distance from Sandport to Shopton had been more than half covered  at noon, when the travelers ate a lunch in the boat.  Mr. Swift was  looking anxiously ahead to catch the first glimpse of his dock and Tom  was adjusting the machinery as finely as he dared to get out of it the  maximum speed.    Ned Newton, who happened to be gazing aloft, wondering at the perfect  beauty of the blue sky after the storm, uttered a sudden exclamation.  Then he arose and pointed at some object in the air.    \"Look!\" he cried, \"A balloon!  It must have gone up from some fair.\"    Tom and his father looked upward.  High in the air, almost over their  heads, was an immense balloon.  It was of the hot-air variety, such as  performers use in which to make ascensions from fair grounds and  circuses, and below it dangled a trapeze, upon which could be observed  a man, only he looked more like a doll than a human being.    \"I shouldn't like to be as high as that,\" remarked Ned.    \"I would,\" answered Tom as he slowed down the engine the better to  watch the balloon.  \"I'd like to go up in an airship, and I intend to  some day.\"    \"I believe he's going to jump!\" suddenly exclaimed Ned after a few  minutes.  \"He's going to do something, anyhow.\"    \"Probably come down in a parachute,\" said Tom.  \"They generally do  that.\"    \"No!  No!\" cried Ned.  \"He isn't going to jump.  Something has  happened!  The balloon is on fire!  He'll be burned to death!\"    Horror stricken, they all gazed aloft.  From the mouth of the balloon  there shot a tongue of fire, and it was followed by a cloud of black  smoke.  The big bag was getting smaller and seemed to be descending,  while the man on the trapeze was hanging downward by his hands to get  as far as possible away from the terrible heat.          CHAPTER XXII    THE RESCUE      \"Jump!  Jump!\" cried Mr. Swift, leaping to his feet and motioning to  the man on the trapeze of the balloon.  But it is doubtful whether or  not the performer heard him.  Certainly he could not see the frantic  motions of the inventor.  \"Why doesn't he jump?\" Mr. Swift went on  piteously to the two lads.  \"He'll surely be burned to death if he  hangs on there!\"    \"It's too far to leap!\" exclaimed Tom.  \"He's a good way up in the air,  though it looks like only a short distance.  He would be killed if he  dropped now.\"    \"He ought to have a parachute,\" added Ned.  \"Most of those men do when  they go up in a balloon.  Why doesn't he come down in that?  I wonder  how the balloon took fire?\"    \"Maybe he hasn't a parachute,\" suggested Tom, while he slowed down the  motor-boat still more so as to remain very nearly under the blazing  balloon.    \"Yes, he has!\" cried Ned.  \"See, it's hanging to one side of the big  bag.  He ought to cut loose.  He could save himself then.  Why doesn't  he?\"    The balloon was slowly twisting about, gradually settling to the  surface of the lake, but all the while the flames were becoming fiercer  and the black clouds of smoke increased in size.    \"There, see the parachute!\" went on Ned.    The twisting of the bag had brought into view the parachute or big,  umbrella-shaped bag, which would have enabled the man to safely drop to  the surface of the lake.  Without it he would have hit the water with  such force that he would have been killed as surely as if he had struck  the solid earth.  But the boys and Mr. Swift also saw something else,  and this was that the balloon was on fire on the same side where the  parachute was suspended.    \"Look! Look!\" shouted Tom, bringing his boat to a stop.  \"That's why he  can't jump!  He can't reach the parachute!\"    By this time the balloon had settled so low that the actions of the man  could be plainly seen. That he was in great agony of fear, as well as  in great pain from the terrific heat over his head was evident. He  shifted about on the trapeze bar, now hanging by one hand, so as to  bring his body a little farther below the blazing end of the bag, then,  when one arm tired, he would hang by the other. If the balloon would  only come down more quickly it would get to within such a short  distance of the water that the man could safely make the drop. But the  immense canvas bag was settling so slowly, for it was still very  buoyant, that considerable time must elapse before it would be near  enough to the water to make it safe for the unfortunate man to let go  the trapeze.    \"Oh, if we could only do something!\" cried Tom.  \"We have to remain  here helpless and watch him burn to death.
