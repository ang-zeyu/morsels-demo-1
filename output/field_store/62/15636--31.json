Another time, to his great satisfaction, he discovered a large piece of  bacon rind among some scraps that the mossback's wife had thrown away.  Later he invaded the sugar-bush by night, gnawing deep notches in the  edges of the sap buckets and barrels, and helping himself to the sirup  in the big boiling-pan.    Life was not all feasting, however. There was a dog who attacked him two  or three times, but who finally learned to keep away and mind his own  business. Once, when he had ventured a little too close to the house,  and was making an unusual racket with his teeth, the mossback came to  the door and fired a shotgun at him, cutting off several of his quills.  And still another night, late in the spring, when he was prowling around  the barn, a bull calf came and smelled him. Next morning the mossback  and his boys threw that calf down on the ground and tied his feet to a  stump, and three of them sat on him while a fourth pulled the quills  from his nose with a pair of pincers. You should have heard him grunt.    Then came the greatest adventure of all. Down beside the railway was a  small platform on which supplies for the lumber-camps were sometimes  unloaded from the trains. Brine and molasses and various other  delectable things had leaked out of the barrels and kegs and boxes, and  the Porcupine discovered that the planks were very nicely seasoned and  flavored. He visited them once too often, for one summer evening, as he  was gnawing away at the site of an ancient puddle of molasses, the  accommodation train rolled in and came to a halt. He tried to hide  behind a stump, but the trainmen caught sight of him, and before he knew  it they had shoved him into an empty box and hoisted him into the  baggage-car. They turned him loose among the passengers on the station  platform at Sault Ste. Marie, and his arrival created a sensation.    When the first excitement had subsided, all the girls in the crowd  declared that they must have some quills for souvenirs, and all the  young men set to work to procure them, hoping to distinguish themselves  by proving their superiority in strength and courage over this poor  little twenty-pound beast just out of the woods. Most of them succeeded  in getting some quills, and also in acquiring some painful  experience--especially the one who attempted to lift the Porcupine by  the tail, and who learned that that interesting member is the very  hottest and liveliest portion of the animal's anatomy. They finally  discovered that the best way to get quills from a live porcupine is to  hit him with a piece of board. The sharp points penetrate the wood and  stick there, the other ends come loose from his skin, and there you have  them. Our friend lost most of his armor that day, and it was a good  thing for him that departed quills, like clipped hair, will renew  themselves in the course of time.    One of the brakemen carried him home, and he spent the next few months  in the enjoyment of city life. Whether he found much pleasure in it is,  perhaps, a question, but I am rather inclined to think that he did. He  had plenty to eat, and he learned that apples are very good indeed, and  that the best way to partake of them is to sit up on your haunches and  hold them between your forepaws. He also learned that men are not always  to be regarded as enemies, for his owner and his owner's children were  good to him and soon won his confidence. But, after all, the city was  not home, and the woods were; so he employed some of his spare time in  gnawing a hole through the wall in a dark corner of the shed where he  was confined, and one night he scrambled out and hid himself in an empty  barn. A day or two later he was in the forest again.    The remaining years of his life were spent on the banks of St. Mary's  River, and for the most part they were years of quietness and  contentment. He was far from his early home, but the bark of a birch or  a maple or a hemlock is much the same on St. Mary's as by the  Glimmerglass. He grew bigger and fatter as time went on, and some weeks  before he died he must have weighed thirty or forty pounds.    Once in a while there was a little dash of excitement to keep life from  becoming too monotonous--if too much monotony is possible in a  porcupine's existence. One night he scrambled up the steps of a little  summer cottage close to the edge of the river, and, finding the door  unlatched, he pushed it open and walked in. It proved to be a cottage  full of girls, and they stood around on chairs and the tops of  wash-stands, bombarded him with curling-irons, poked feebly with  bed-slats, and shrieked with laughter till the farmers over on the  Canadian shore turned in their beds and wondered what could be happening  on Uncle Sam's side of the river. The worst of it was that in his  travels around the room he had come up behind the door and pushed it  shut, and it was some time before even the red-haired girl could muster  up sufficient courage to climb down from her perch and open it again.    At another time an Indian robbed him of the longest and best of his  quills--nearly five inches in length some of them--and carried them off  to be used in ornamenting birch-bark baskets. And on still another  occasion he narrowly escaped death at the hands of an irate canoe-man,  in the side of whose Rob Roy he had gnawed a great hole.    The end came at last, and it was the saddest, hardest, strangest fate  that can ever come to a wild creature of the woods. He--who had never  known hunger in all his life, who was almost the only animal in the  forest who had never looked famine in the eye, whose table was spread  with good things from January to December, and whose storehouse was full  from Lake Huron to the Pictured Rocks--he of all others, was condemned  to die of starvation in the midst of plenty. The Ancient Mariner, with  water all around him and not a drop to drink, was no worse off than our  Porcupine; and the Mariner finally escaped, but the Porky didn't.    One of the summer tourists who wandered up into the north woods that  year had carried with him a little rifle, more of a toy than a weapon,  a thing that a sportsman would hardly have condescended to laugh at. And  one afternoon, by ill luck, he caught sight of the Porcupine high up in  the top of a tall tree. It was his first chance at a genuine wild beast,  and he fired away all his cartridges as fast as he could load them into  his gun. He thought that every shot missed, and he was very much ashamed  of his marksmanship. But he was mistaken. The very last bullet broke one  of the Porcupine's lower front teeth, and hurt him terribly. It jarred  him to the very end of his tail, and his head felt as if it was being  smashed to bits. For a minute or two the strength all went out of him,  and if he had not been lying in a safe, comfortable crotch he would have  fallen to the ground.    The pain and the shock passed away after a while, but when supper-time  came--and it was almost always supper-time with the Porcupine--his left  lower incisor was missing. The right one was uninjured, however, and for  a while he got on pretty well, merely having to spend a little more time  than usual over his meals. But that was only the beginning of trouble.  The stump of the broken tooth was still there and still growing, and it  was soon as long as ever, but in the meantime its fellow in the upper  jaw had grown out beyond its normal length, and the two did not meet  properly. Instead of coming together edge to edge, as they should have  done, each wearing the other down and keeping it from reaching out too  far, each one now pushed the other aside, and still they kept on  growing, growing, growing. Worst of all, in a short time they had begun  to crowd his jaws apart so that he could hardly use his right-hand  teeth, and they too were soon out of shape. The evil days had come, and  the sound of the grinding was low. Little by little his mouth was forced  open wider and wider, and the food that passed his lips grew less and  less. His teeth, that had all his life been his best tools and his most  faithful servants, had turned against him in his old age, and were  killing him by inches. Let us not linger over those days.    He was spared the very last and worst pangs--for that, at least, we may  be thankful. On the last day of his life he sat under a beech-tree, weak  and weary and faint. He could not remember when he had eaten. His coat  of hair and quills was as thick and bushy as ever, and outwardly he had  hardly changed at all, but under his skin there was little left but  bones. And as he sat there and wished that he was dead--if such a wish  can ever come to a wild animal--the Angel of Mercy came, in the shape  of a man with a revolver in his pistol pocket--a man who liked to kill  things.    \"A porky!\" he said. \"Guess I'll shoot him, just for fun.\"    The Porcupine saw him coming and knew the danger; and for a moment the  old love of life came back as strong as ever, and he gathered his feeble  strength for one last effort, and started up the tree. He was perhaps  six feet from the ground when the first report came.    \"Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!\" Four shots, as fast as the self-cocking  revolver could pour the lead into his body. The Porky stopped climbing.  For an instant he hung motionless on the side of the tree, and then his  forepaws let go, and he swayed backward and fell to the ground. And that  was the end of the Porcupine.          THE ADVENTURES OF A LOON      HIS name was Mahng, and the story which I am about to relate is the  story of his matrimonial career--or at least of a portion of it.    One snowy autumn night, three years ago, he was swimming on the  Glimmerglass in company with his first wife--one of the first, that is.

The courage of these creatures is  amazing; and the discipline upon which they are formed does not a little  honour to the Hottentot genius and dexterity.    \"The Hottentots have likewise great numbers of oxen for carriage. These,  too, are very strong and stately creatures, chosen out of the herds, at  about the age of two years, by old men, well skilled in cattle. When  they have destined an ox to carry burdens, they take and throw him on  his back on the ground; and fastening his head and feet with strong  ropes to stakes firmly fixed in the ground, they make a hole with a  sharp knife through his upper lip, between his nostrils. Into this hole  they put a stick, about half an inch thick, and a foot and a half long,  with a hook at top to prevent its falling through. By this hooked stick  they break him to obedience and good behaviour; for if he refuses to be  governed, or to carry the burdens they lay upon him, they fix his nose  by this hooked stick to the ground, and there hold it till he comes to a  better temper.    \"It is an exquisite torture to an Ox to be fastened to the ground by the  nose in this manner. He is not, therefore, long exercised this way,  before he gets a notion of his duty, and becomes tractable. After which,  the very sight alone of the stick, when he is wanton or refractory, will  humble and reduce him to the will of his driver. The terror of this  stick, likewise makes the carriage oxen so attentive to the words of  command the Hottentots use to them, that they quickly conceive and, ever  while they live, afterwards retain the intention of them. I have a  thousand times been surprised at the ready obedience the carriage oxen  have paid to a Hottentot's bare words. They are as quick at  apprehending, and as exact in performing the orders of their driver, as  is any taught dog in Europe at conceiving and accomplishing the orders  of his master. The stick--the terrible stick--makes them all attention  and diligence.\"          AFRICAN BULL.      The following notice, which will explain itself, appeared in Loudon's  'Magazine of Natural History,' for July, 1828.    \"Some Account of a particular Variety of Bull (_Bos Taurus_), now  exhibiting in London. By Mrs. Harvey.    \"Sir,--Agreeably to your request, Mr. Harvey has taken a portrait of  this animal; and as he has made the drawing on the wood himself, the  engraving will be a very perfect resemblance.[C] I have, on my part,  drawn up the following particulars, from what my husband told me, and I  shall be happy if they prove of any interest to you or your readers:--    [Illustration]    \"This animal belongs to a French woman, who says he was brought from  Africa to Bordeaux when a calf; and, after having been shown in  different parts of the Continent, was taken to London, and exhibited at  the Grand Bazaar in King's Street, Portman Square, last autumn. He is  at present five years old, four feet high at the shoulder and seven feet  in length, from the horns to the insertion of the tail. The length of  his face is one foot eight inches, and the girth round the collar seven  feet six inches. His hair is short and silky, and the colour a cream or  yellowish white, except two black tufts which appear on each foot. On  the back of the neck there is a hump or swelling, which seems confined  to this variety. The general aspect of the animal is mild and docile;  but, when irritated, his expression is very remarkable, exhibiting  itself principally in the eye. This, in its ordinary state, is very  peculiar, (fig. 1, _a_,) rising more than one-half above the orbit, and  bearing a resemblance to a cup and ball, thus enabling the animal to see  on all sides with equal ease. The iris is naturally of a pale blue  colour; but, when the animal is irritated, it varies from a very pale  blue or lilac to a deep crimson. Its form is also very remarkable, being  a small oval, or rather a parallelogram, with the ends cut off, and  lying transversely across the ball, (fig. 1, _b_.)    [Illustration: Fig. 1. Eyes of African Bull.]    [Illustration: Fig. 2.]    \"The black tufts, mentioned above, are the lateral hoofs (fig. 2), which  the animal sheds annually, and which grow to the length of five or six  inches. They are not shed together, or at stated periods; for those of  the fore-feet, (_a_, _b_,) in this example, are at present of different  ages, and, consequently, of different lengths; the difference between  them being exactly that represented in the sketch.    \"On the hump or collar, the hair grows much longer than on the other  parts of the body, forming a sort of curled mane, resembling, I should  imagine, that of the Bison. It is perfectly white, growing to the length  of one foot six inches, and adding greatly to the height of the rising  part behind the horns. At present the hair is only beginning to grow;  but it will be in full beauty at the approach of the winter months, and  will fall off gradually again in the early part of the succeeding spring.    [Illustration: Fig. 3. Dewlap of African Bull.]    \"The keeper pointed out to Mr. Harvey, as a remarkable peculiarity, that  the dewlap (fig. 3), in passing between the fore-legs (_a_), and under  the body (_b_), seemed to divide itself into three parts, which they  called the three stomachs, (1, 2, 3,) from their being very much acted  on in the progress of digestion.\"        I remain.

CHILLINGHAM WHITE CATTLE.    _Bos Taurus.--Restricted Variety._      [Illustration]    Considerable interest has always been connected with the history of  those herds of white cattle which have been kept secluded, apparently  from time immemorial, in the parks of some of our aristocracy.[D] It has  been, and still is, a matter of lordly pride to their noble owners,  that these cattle are held to be of a distinct and untameable race.    Feeling a full share of the interest attached to them, and anxious to  gain the most accurate and circumstantial information, I was induced to  pay a visit, during the summer of 1845, to the beautifully wooded and  undulating Park of Chillingham, in which a herd of these cattle is  preserved; and, although I have not been able to gather material for a  perfect history of these animals, I think it will not be difficult to  show that matters respecting them have been set forth as facts which are  fictions; and that from some points of their history which have been  correctly detailed, inferences have been drawn, which are by no means  warranted by the facts.    In endeavouring to point out these errors and false reasonings, it will  be necessary to make quotations from the old history of the white  cattle, in Culley's 'Observations on Live Stock,' which has been so  often repeated in works on natural history, and is, moreover, so  thoroughly accredited, that it may now appear something like presumption  to call it in question. To what extent it is called in question on the  present occasion, and the reasons for so doing, will be seen in the  running commentary which accompanies these quotations.    Culley says: \"The Wild Breed, from being untameable, can only be kept  within walls or good fences; consequently very few of them are now to be  met with, except in the parks of some gentlemen, who keep them for  ornament, and as a curiosity: those I have seen are at Chillingham  Castle, in Northumberland, a seat belonging to the Earl of Tankerville.\"    The statement of their being untameable is a mere assertion, founded  upon no evidence whatever. But so far is it from being the fact, that,  notwithstanding every means are used to preserve their wildness, such as  allowing them to range in an extensive park--seldom intruding upon  them--hunting and shooting them now and then--notwithstanding these  means are taken to preserve their wildness, they are even now so far  domesticated as voluntarily to present themselves every winter, at a  place prepared for them, for the purpose of being fed. From which it may  reasonably be concluded, that were they restricted in their pasture,  gradually familiarised with the presence of human beings, and in every  other respect treated as ordinary cattle, they would, in the course of  two or three generations, be equally tame and tractable.    Whilst writing the foregoing I was not aware that any attempt had been  made to domesticate these so-called untameable oxen; but on reading an  account of these cattle by Mr. Hindmarsh, of Newcastle-upon-Tyne,  (bearing date about 1837,) I find the following paragraph.    \"By taking the calves at a very early age, and treating them gently, the  present keeper succeeded in domesticating an ox and a cow. _They became  as tame as domestic animals_, and the ox fed as rapidly as a  short-horned steer. He lived eighteen years, and when at his best was  computed at 8 cwt. 14 lbs. The cow only lived five or six years. She  gave little milk, but the quality was rich. She was crossed by a country  bull, but her progeny very closely resembled herself, being entirely  white, excepting the ears, which were brown, and the legs, which were  mottled.\" These facts speak for themselves.    Culley, in giving their distinguishing characteristics, says: \"Their  colour is invariably of a creamy white; muzzle black; the whole of the  inside of the ear, and about one third of the outside, from the tips  downwards, red; horns white, with black tips, very fine, and bent  upwards; some of the bulls have a thin upright mane, about an inch and a  half, or two inches long.\"    That their colour is invariably white is simply owing to the care that  is taken to destroy all"]]]
