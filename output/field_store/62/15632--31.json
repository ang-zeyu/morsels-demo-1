The incident justifies the inference  that the services of junior counsel to senior barristers--services at  the present time termed 'devilling'--were formerly remunerated with cash  payments.    Toward the close of Charles I.'s reign--at a time when political  distractions were injuriously affecting the legal profession, especially  the staunch royalists of the long robe--Maynard, the Parliamentary  lawyer, received on one round of the Western Circuit, L700, \"which,\"  observes Whitelock, to whom Maynard communicated the fact, \"I believe  was more than any one of our profession got before.\"    Concerning the incomes made by eminent counsel in Charles II.'s time,  many _data_ are preserved in diaries and memoirs. That a thousand a year  was looked upon as a good income for a flourishing practitioner of the  'merry monarch's' Chancery bar, may be gathered from a passage in  'Pepys's Diary,' where the writer records the compliments paid to him  regarding his courageous and eloquent defence of the Admiralty, before  the House of Commons, in March, 1668. Under the influence of half-a-pint  of mulled sack and a dram of brandy, the Admiralty clerk made such a  spirited and successful speech in behalf of his department, that he was  thought to have effectually silenced all grumblers against the  management of his Majesty's navy. Compliments flowed in upon the orator  from all directions. Sir William Coventry pledged his judgment that the  fame of the oration would last for ever in the Commons; silver-tongued  Sir Heneage Finch, in the blandest tones, averred that no other living  man could have made so excellent a speech; the placemen of the Admiralty  vied with each other in expressions of delight and admiration; and one  flatterer, whose name is not recorded, caused Mr. Pepys infinite  pleasure by saying that the speaker who had routed the accusers of a  government office, might easily earn a thousand a year at the Chancery  bar.    That sum, however, is insignificant when it is compared with the incomes  made by the most fortunate advocates of that period. Eminent speakers of  the Common Law Bar made between L2000 and L3500 per annum on circuit and  at Westminster, without the aid of king's business; and still larger  receipts were recorded in the fee-books of his Majesty's attorneys and  solicitors. At the Chancery bar of the second Charles, there was at  least one lawyer, who in one year made considerably more than four times  the income that was suggested to Pepys's vanity and self-complacence. At  Stanford Court, Worcestershire, is preserved a fee-book kept by Sir  Francis Winnington, Solicitor-General to the 'merry monarch,' from  December 1674 to January 13, 1679, from the entries of which record the  reader may form a tolerably correct estimate of the professional  revenues of successful lawyers at that time. In Easter Term, 1671, Sir  Francis pocketed L459; in Trinity Term L449 10s.; in Michaelmas Term  L521; and in Hilary Term 1672, L361 10s.; the income for the year being  L1791, without his earnings on the Oxford Circuit and during vacation.  In 1673, Sir Francis received L3371; in 1674, he earned L3560;[8] and in  1675--_i.e._, the first year of his tenure of the Solicitor's  office--his professional income wars L4066, of which sum L429 were  office fees. Concerning the Attorney-General's receipts about this time,  we have sufficient information from Roger North, who records that his  brother, whilst Attorney General, made nearly seven thousand pounds in  one year, from private and official business. It is noteworthy that  North, as Attorney General, made the same income which Coke realized in  the same office at the commencement of the century. But under the  Stuarts this large income of L7000--in those days a princely  revenue--was earned by work so perilous and fruitful of obloquy, that  even Sir Francis, who loved money and cared little for public esteem,  was glad to resign the post of Attorney and retire to the Pleas with  L4000 a year. That the fees of the Chancery lawyers under Charles II.  were regulated upon a liberal scale we know from Roger North, and the  record of Sir John King's success. Speaking of his brother Francis, the  biographer says: \"After he, as king's counsel, came within the bar, he  began to have calls into the Court of Chancery; which he liked very  well, because the quantity of the business, _as well as the fees_, was  greater; but his home was the King's Bench, where he sat and reported  like as other practitioners.\" And in Sir John King's memoirs it is  recorded that in 1676 he made L4700, and that he received from L40 to  L50 a day during the last four days of his appearance in court. Dying in  1677,[9] whilst his supremacy in his own court was at its height, Sir  John King was long spoken of as a singularly successful Chancery  barrister.    Of Francis North's mode of taking and storing his fees, the 'Life of  Lord Keeper Guildford' gives the following picture: \"His business  increased, even while he was Solicitor, to be so much as to have  overwhelmed one less dexterous; but when he was made Attorney General,  though his gains by his office were great, they were much greater by his  practice; for that flowed in upon him like an orage, enough to overset  one that had not an extraordinary readiness in business. His skull-caps,  which he wore when he had leisure to observe his constitution, as I  touched before, were now destined to lie in a drawer to receive the  money that came in by fees. One had the gold, another the crowns and  half-crowns, and another the smaller money. When these vessels were  full, they were committed to his friend (the Hon. Roger North), who was  constantly near him, to tell out the cash, and put it into the bags  according to the contents; and so they went to his treasurers, Blanchard  and Child, goldsmiths, Temple Bar.\"[10] In the days of wigs, skull-caps  like those which Francis North used as receptacles for money, were very  generally worn by men of all classes and employments. On returning to  the privacy of his home, a careful citizen usually laid aside his costly  wig, and replaced it with a cheap and durable skull-cap, before he sat  down in his parlor. So also, men careful of their health often wore  skull-caps _under_ their wigs, on occasions when they were required to  endure a raw atmosphere without the protection of their beavers. In days  when the law-courts were held in the open hall of Westminster, and  lawyers practising therein, were compelled to sit or speak for hours  together, exposed to sharp currents of cold air, it was customary for  wearers of the long robe to place between their wigs and natural hair  closely-fitting caps, made of stout silk or soft leather. But more  interesting than the money-caps, are the fees which they contained. The  ringing of the gold pieces, the clink of the crowns with the  half-crowns, and the rattle of the smaller money, led back the barrister  to those happier and remote times, when the 'inferior order' of the  profession paid the superior order with 'money down;' when, the advocate  never opened his mouth till his fingers had closed upon the gold of his  trustful client; when 'credit' was unknown in transactions between  counsel and attorney;--that truly _golden_ age of the bar, when the  barrister was less suspicious of the attorney, and the attorney held  less power over the barrister.    Having profited by the liberal payments of Chancery whilst he was an  advocate, Lord Keeper Guildford destroyed one source of profit to  counsel from which Francis North, the barrister, had drawn many a capful  of money. Saith Roger, \"He began to rescind all motions for speeding and  delaying the hearing of causes besides the ordinary rule of court; and  this lopped off a limb of the motion practice. I have heard Sir John  Churchill, a famous Chancery practitioner, say, that in his walk from  Lincoln's Inn down to the Temple Hall, where, in the Lord Keeper  Bridgman's time, causes and motions out of term were heard, he had taken  L28. with breviates only for motions and defences for hastening and  retarding hearings. His lordship said, that the rule of the court  allowed time enough for any one to proceed or defend; and if, for  special reasons, he should give way to orders for timing matters, it  would let in a deluge of vexatious pretenses, which, true or false,  being asserted by the counsel with equal assurance, distracted the  court and confounded the suitors.\"    Let due honor be rendered to one Caroline, lawyer, who was remarkable  for his liberality to clients, and carelessness of his own pecuniary  interests. From his various biographers, many pleasant stories may be  gleaned concerning Hale's freedom from base love of money. In his days,  and long afterward, professional etiquette permitted clients and counsel  to hold intercourse without the intervention of an attorney. Suitors,  therefore, frequently addressed him personally and paid for his advice  with their own hands, just as patients are still accustomed to fee their  doctors. To these personal applicants, and also to clients who  approached him by their agents, he was very liberal. \"When those who  came to ask his counsel gave him a piece, he used to give back the half,  and to make ten shillings his fee in ordinary matters that did not  require much time or study.\" From this it may be inferred that whilst  Hale was an eminent member of the bar, twenty shillings was the usual  fee to a leading counsel, and an angel the customary honorarium to an  ordinary practitioner. As readers have already been told, the angel[11]  was a common fee in the seventeenth century; but the story of Hale's"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27827"],[0,"The Kama Sutra of Vatsyayana (#20)"],[1,"  At the time of her marriage the widow should obtain from her husband the  money to pay the cost of drinking parties, and picnics with her  relations, and of giving them and her friends kindly gifts and presents;  or she may do these things at her own cost if she likes. In the same way  she may wear either her husband's ornaments or her own. As to the  presents of affection mutually exchanged between the husband and herself  there is no fixed rule about them. If she leaves her husband after  marriage of her own accord, she should restore to him whatever he may  have given her, with the exception of the mutual presents. If however  she is driven out of the house by her husband she should not return  anything to him.    After her marriage she should live in the house of her husband like one  of the chief members of the family, but should treat the other ladies of  the family with kindness, the servants with generosity, and all the  friends of the house with familiarity and good temper. She should show  that she is better acquainted with the sixty-four arts than the other  ladies of the house, and in any quarrels with her husband she should not  rebuke him severely, but in private do everything that he wishes, and  make use of the sixty-four ways of enjoyment. She should be obliging to  the other wives of her husband, and to their children she should give  presents, behave as their mistress, and make ornaments and play things  for their use. In the friends and servants of her husband she should  confide more than in his other wives, and finally she should have a  liking for drinking parties, going to picnics, attending fairs and  festivals, and for carrying out all kinds of games and amusements.    Thus ends the conduct of a virgin widow re-married.    A woman who is disliked by her husband, and annoyed and distressed by  his other wives, should associate with the wife who is liked most by her  husband, and who serves him more than the others, and should teach her  all the arts with which she is acquainted. She should act as the nurse  of her husband's children, and having gained over his friends to her  side, should through them make him acquainted of her devotion to him. In  religious ceremonies she should be a leader, as also in vows and fasts,  and should not hold too good an opinion of herself. When her husband is  lying on his bed she should only go near him when it is agreeable to  him, and should never rebuke him, or show obstinacy in any way. If her  husband happens to quarrel with any of his other wives, she should  reconcile them to each other, and if he desires to see any woman  secretly, she should manage to bring about the meeting between them. She  should moreover make herself acquainted with the weak points of her  husband's character, but always keep them secret, and on the whole  behave herself in such an way as may lead him to look upon her as a good  and devoted wife.    Here ends the conduct of a wife disliked by her husband.    The above sections will show how all the women of the King's seraglio  are to behave, and therefore we shall now speak separately only about  the king.    The female attendants in the harem (called severally Kanchukiyas,[54]  Mahallarikas,[55] and Mahallikas,[56]) should bring flowers, ointments  and clothes from the King's wives to the King, and he having received  these things should give them as presents to the servants, along with  the things worn by him the previous day. In the afternoon the King,  having dressed and put on his ornaments, should interview the women of  the harem, who should also be dressed and decorated with jewels. Then  having given to each of them such a place and such respect as may suit  the occasion and as they may deserve, he should carry on with them a  cheerful conversation. After that he should see such of his wives as may  be virgin widows re-married, and after them the concubines and dancing  girls. All of these should be visited in their own private rooms.    When the King rises from his noonday sleep, the woman whose duty it is  to inform the King regarding the wife who is to spend the night with him  should come to him accompanied by the female attendants of that wife  whose turn may have arrived in the regular course, and of her who may  have been accidentally passed over as her turn arrived, and of her who  may have been unwell at the time of her turn. These attendants should  place before the King the ointments and unguents sent by each of these  wives, marked with the seal of her ring, and their names and their  reasons for sending the ointments should be told to the King. After this  the King accepts the ointment of one of them, who then is informed that  her ointment has been accepted, and that her day has been settled.[57]    At festivals, singing parties and exhibitions, all the wives of the King  should be treated with respect and served with drinks.    But the women of the harem should not be allowed to go out alone,  neither should any women outside the harem be allowed to enter it except  those whose character is well known. And lastly the work which the  King's wives have to do should not be too fatiguing.    Thus ends the conduct of the King towards the women of the harem, and of  their own conduct.    A man marrying many wives should act fairly towards them all. He should  neither disregard nor pass over their faults, and should not reveal to  one wife the love, passion, bodily blemishes, and confidential  reproaches of the other. No opportunity should be given to any one of  them of speaking to him about their rivals, and if one of them should  begin to speak ill of another, he should chide her and tell her that she  has exactly the same blemishes in her character. One of them he should  please by secret confidence, another by secret respect, and another by  secret flattery, and he should please them all by going to gardens, by  amusements, by presents, by honouring their relations, by telling them  secrets, and lastly by loving unions. A young woman who is of a good  temper, and who conducts herself according to the precepts of the Holy  Writ, wins her husband's attachment, and obtains a superiority over her  rivals.    Thus ends the conduct of a husband towards many wives.

But as it happened sometimes that some of  them lost their turns owing to the King's absence, or to their being  unwell, then in such cases the women whose turns had been passed over,  and those whose turns had come, used to have a sort of lottery, and the  ointment of all the claimants were sent to the King, who accepted the  ointment of one of them, and thus settled the question.]    =END OF PART IV.=          PART V.    ABOUT THE WIVES OF OTHER MEN.          CHAPTER I.    OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF MEN AND WOMEN.--THE REASONS WHY WOMEN REJECT  THE ADDRESSES OF MEN.--ABOUT MEN WHO HAVE SUCCESS WITH WOMEN, AND ABOUT  WOMEN WHO ARE EASILY GAINED OVER.      The wives of other people may be resorted to on the occasions already  described in Part I., Chapter 5, of this work, but the possibility of  their acquisition, their fitness for cohabitation, the danger to oneself  in uniting with them, and the future effect of these unions, should  first of all be examined. A man may resort to the wife of another, for  the purpose of saving his own life, when he perceives that his love for  her proceeds from one degree of intensity to another. These degrees are  ten in number, and are distinguished by the following marks:    1. Love of the eye.    2. Attachment of the mind.    3. Constant reflection.    4. Destruction of sleep.    5. Emaciation of the body.    6. Turning away from objects of enjoyment.    7. Removal of shame.    8. Madness.    9. Fainting.    10. Death.    Ancient authors say that a man should know the disposition,  truthfulness, purity, and will of a young woman, as also the intensity,  or weakness of her passions, from the form of her body, and from her  characteristic marks and signs. But Vatsyayana is of opinion that the  forms of bodies, and the characteristic marks or signs are but erring  tests of character, and that women should be judged by their conduct, by  the outward expression of their thoughts, and by the movements of their  bodies.    Now as a general rule Gonikaputra says that a woman falls in love with  every handsome man she sees, and so does every man at the sight of a  beautiful woman, but frequently they do not take any further steps,  owing to various considerations. In love the following circumstances are  peculiar to the woman. She loves without regard to right or wrong,[58]  and does not try to gain over a man simply for the attainment of some  particular purpose. Moreover, when a man first makes up to her she  naturally shrinks from him, even though she may be willing to unite  herself with him. But when the attempts to gain her are repeated and  renewed, she at last consents. But with a man, even though he may have  begun to love, he conquers his feelings from a regard for morality and  wisdom, and although his thoughts are often on the woman, he does not  yield, even though an attempt be made to"]]]
