III. On a omis, sous les titres de _Juif_ et _Juive de  Salonique_, dessins de Bida, pages 108 et 109, la mention  suivante: d'après M. A. Proust.      IV. On a également omis de donner, à la page 146, la description  des oiseaux et du reptile de l'archipel des Galapagos représentés  sur la page 145. Nous réparons cette omission:    1º _Tanagra Darwinii_, variété du genre des  _Tanagras_ très-nombreux en Amérique. Ces oiseaux ne diffèrent de  nos moineaux, dont ils ont à peu près les habitudes, que par la  brillante diversité des couleurs et par les échancrures de la  mandibule supérieure de leur bec.    2º _Cactornis assimilis:_ Darwin le nomme _Tisseim des  Galapagos_, où l'on peut le voir souvent grimper autour des  fleurs du grand cactus. Il appartient particulièrement à l'île  Saint-Charles. Des treize espèces du genre _pinson_, que le  naturaliste trouva dans cet archipel, chacune semble affectée à  une île en particulier.    3º _Pyrocephalus nanus_, très-joli petit oiseau du  sous-genre _muscicapa_, gobe-mouches, tyrans ou moucherolles. Le  mâle de cette variété a une tête de feu. Il hante à la fois les  bois humides des plus hautes parties des îles _Galapagos_ et les  districts arides et rocailleux.    4º _Sylvicola aureola._ Ce charmant oiseau, d'un jaune  d'or, appartient aux îles Galapagos.    5º Le _Leiocephalus grayii_ est l'une des nombreuses  nouveautés rapportées par les navigateurs du _Beagle_. Dans le  pays on le nomme _holotropis_, et moins curieux peut-être que  l'_amblyrhinchus_, il est cependant remarquable en ce que c'est  un des plus beaux sauriens, sinon le plus beau saurien qui  existe.    Le saurien _amblyrhinchus cristatus_, que nous reproduisons ici,  est décrit dans le texte, page 147.

These paintings are boldly and well executed, and  are of the highest interest. Indeed, their workmanship is such, that  many antiquaries refused to believe that they were contemporary with  the building itself. As if the little chapel had not suffered  vicissitudes enough, it was put up to public auction at the Revolution  in 1789, and used by its new proprietors as a stable and granary. They  were careful to cover the whole of their ceiling with a thick coat of  whitewash, and it is only in the last few years that the patriotic  work of M. Lecointe has been completed by the careful recovery of  these ancient paintings from beneath their bed of whitewash. Even then  their value was not fully appreciated, and only when M. LeRoy had  submitted certain detached portions to a chemical analysis was it  proved that frescoes of the twelfth century had really been preserved.    By this careful observer it has been shown that a couch of sandy  mortar was first laid on the stones of the vault, then a second layer,  rich in lime, and especially in white of egg, was applied, and the  surface was ready for the application of the colours. These are blue,  green, yellow ochre, reddish-brown, black, and white. Cobalt blue, or  \"azure,\" was only discovered in the sixteenth century by a German  glass-maker. The blue used in these paintings is the true \"outremer\"  of the twelfth century, the solid colour made from lapislazuli, which  was worth its weight in gold. That it was employed at all, is one more  evidence of the munificence of Henry II. in his foundation. The green  is a mixture of this blue with the yellow ochre. The white was made of  powdered egg shells, and the black is lamp black. From the fact that  the colouring matter has in no case penetrated the prepared surface,  but adheres to it, we may argue finally that the process in which  white of egg is the chief constituent was used to lay on the colours.    Besides the heart of Richard Coeur de Lion, the Cathedral of Rouen  contains another relic of the Norman days in the tomb of that Empress  Matilda, who as Countess of Anjou, gave Henry Plantagenet to the  throne of England, and died in 1167. Her rich sepulchre at Bec was  pillaged by the English in 1421, and the restored monument was  desecrated in 1793, but in 1846 the original casket was discovered by  the fortunate stroke of a pickaxe, and now rests in the Cathedral. In  1124 the shrine containing the body of the famous St. Romain was  opened in the presence of the King and Queen of England, and  fifty-four years afterwards, as the decorations made for it by  Guillaume Bonne Ame had been taken for alms to the poor, Archbishop  Rotrou made a new and more magnificent covering for the venerated  relics that play so large a part in the story of the town. This new  and Norman shrine it must have been which was carried by the two  prisoners, delivered by the Privilege of the Fierte in 1194, but it  has long ago been replaced by later work.    [Illustration: CORBEL FROM THE OLD CHURCH OF ST. PAUL]    There is but one more religious monument, the last building I can show  you in this chapter, that has remained from these centuries until now.  Walk along the riverside eastwards, and as the waters flow from Paris  towards you on your right, stop where the chalk cliffs of St.  Catherine's Mount begin to slope downwards from the left hand of the  road. Just between it and the river is the Church of St. Paul, which  stands where the first Christian altar replaced the Temple of Adonis,  and watched with St. Gervais and St. Godard the infant town of  Rothomagus arise.    It was no doubt at the time when St. Romain himself finally destroyed  the Tarasque of idolatry that this first church arose above the ruins  of the pagan shrine. But of Roman or Merovingian structures St. Paul  can show no trace. It has, however, an extremely interesting early  Norman apse, which is different to everything else in Rouen, and older  than any other building, save St. Mellon's crypt at St. Gervais. By  going round the outside you can see three apses, and as you stand  there, the midmost apse is the Norman building, that on your left is  of the ninth century, and that on the right of the fourteenth. This  Norman flat-buttressed and round-arched apse is directed to the east  of summer, while the new church in the same place points to the east  of winter, and is almost at right angles to the older one. The corbels  outside, beneath the roof, are carved with the hairy-bearded faces of  conquered Franks and Saxons, who were thus set up to the perpetual  derision of their clean-shaved Norman victors. The idea is as old as  the Temple of Agrigentum in 600 B.C., where the conquered Africans  hold up the weight of the building, and recalls the barbarity of the  primitive Sagas, which relate how the bleeding heads of enemies  themselves were placed around the temples of the Norsemen.    The nave goes back into some private property beyond the churchyard,  in which a forgotten tomb lies mouldering behind the railings. In the  grass to the right of the old apse you can see a pointed arch  springing from a capital, which shows how the surrounding soil has  risen since the thirteenth century. This old building is all used as  the vestry of the new church, through which you must pass to see the  interior of the ancient buildings. Once within them, you will find  nearest to you the fourteenth-century work of which a fragment showed  outside. Then comes the Norman chapel, that recalls the work in the  abbey of St. George's de Boscherville. Beyond that again is the  ninth-century \"Saxon\" buildings. The archaic quality of the decoration  is very notable in the capital that represents the adoration of the  Magi, and indicates the relative importance of the personages by the  size in which each is carved, just as is done in the Egyptian  sculptures.    [Illustration: APSE OF THE OLD CHURCH OF ST. PAUL]    With these few relics the tale of Norman architecture in Rouen is  finished. From a short survey of this town alone, no one who had never  seen Caen or Coutances would imagine that he was in the duchy which  possessed a school of architecture that was developed into Notre Dame,  on the one hand, in the Ile de France, and into Durham, on the other,  in England. In our own island the architecture before the eleventh  century, which it supplanted, known as the Anglo-Saxon, was a  primitive Romanesque of purely Italian origin, as shown in  Bradford-on-Avon Church, which was built by Ealdhelm in Wessex long  before the Conquest. This is the only entire building of the earlier  style that we have, though the towers of Earl's Barton, of Bywell, of  St. Benets in Cambridge, remain to show its affinity to the styles of  Italy and Western Europe, and of the Campaniles. Even when the Norman  work first appears, it is not without a great deal of that Byzantine  element which is expressed by a spreading cupola and a central  lantern. But this early Norman building is very rare, and that is why  the three churches I have just described in Rouen have a value that is  scarcely realised by travellers who are in search for Gothic or  Renaissance architecture only. They are somewhat difficult of access  too, and little known, but they will repay a visit. They show the form  of the Latin cross, with little in its eastern limb besides the apse,  the choir beneath the central tower that replaced the Byzantine  cupola, and a little vaulting in the aisles. Originally they had a  flat ceiling for frescoes. This is a style that was neither that of  Southern Italy nor that of Aquitaine. It may have been a distinctively  national development of the Lombard schools of Pavia or Milan. But in  any case, though purely local at first, it utterly supplanted the  Primitive Romanesque that had hitherto been the common possession of  Western Europe, just as, in later centuries, the pointed style utterly  swept away the round arch in all its forms of expression. And in the  coming chapters it is with the pointed arch that we shall have more  and more to deal. To Italy, who imitated it helplessly, the Northern  Gothic never became even remotely national in its expression. The  native Southern Romanesque was there only appropriately replaced by  the really Italian style developed in the Roman Renaissance. But in  the North, where the early pointed arch had been at first only a  memory of Paynim victories, or a trophy of early Saracenic work, the  pointed style as a school of architecture was destined to triumph  immediately it rose from the position of mere ornament to the  necessity of a constructive feature. It was the problem of vaulting  over a space that was not square, which gave the pointed arch its  reason for absolute existence, its beauty of proved strength and  adequate proportion. Some of the noblest forms of its development are  to be found in the buildings we shall see later on in Rouen.    [Illustration]    [Illustration: MAP D.

[Illustration: THE ARMS OF FRANCE]    If the Norman capital that Philip Augustus added to the royal domain  of France was not particularly rich, as I have shown, in architectural  beauty, it possessed something more enduring even than stone, more  vital than any school of architecture, something also far more  precious as an indication of coming prosperity and strength; and this  was the beginning of the independence and wealth of the citizens of  Rouen, as symbolised by the beginning of their Commune.
