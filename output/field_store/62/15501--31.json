The contempt it shows for the memory of  the dead is appalling; the credulity and ignorance it displays are  inconceivable.    Miss Addams does not know that even from France they have banished  absinthe. If she doubts that in this France had succeeded let her ask  for it. I asked for it, and each maitre d'hotel treated me as though I  had proposed we should assassinate General Joffre.    If Miss Addams does know that the French Government has banished  absinthe, then she is accusing it of openly receiving the  congratulations of the world for destroying the drug while secretly  using it to make fiends of the army. If what Miss Addams states is  true, then the French Government is rotten, French officers deserve  only court-martial, and French soldiers are cowards.    If we are to believe her, the Canadians at Ypres, the Australians in  the Dardanelles, the English and the French on the Aisne made no  supreme sacrifice, but were killed in a drunken brawl.    Miss Addams desires peace. So does every one else. But she will not  attain peace by misrepresentation. I have seen more of this war and  other wars than Miss Addams, and I know all war to be wicked,  wasteful, and unintelligent, and where Miss Addams can furnish one  argument in favor of peace I will furnish a hundred. But against this  insult, flung by a complacent and self-satisfied woman at men who gave  their lives for men, I protest. And I believe that with me are all  those women and men who respect courage and honor.    RICHARD HARDING DAVIS.          The Drive at Warsaw    Germany's Story of the Eastern Campaign    Battles of Radymno, Przemysl, Lemberg, the Dniester, Krasnik,  Przasnysz, Ostrolenka         The grand sweep of the victorious German armies through       Galicia and into Poland, on a more tremendous scale than has       hitherto been witnessed in the warfare of history, is       recorded in the semi-official German accounts of the Wolff       Telegraphic Bureau, published by the Frankfurter Zeitung       from June 3 to June 29, and translated below. The official       German reports of the campaign concentrated upon the Polish       capital of Warsaw follow. On July 19 a Petrograd dispatch to       the London Morning Post reported that Emperor William had       telegraphed his sister, the Queen of Greece, to the effect       that he had \"paralyzed Russia for at least six months to       come\" and was on the eve of \"delivering a coup on the       western front that will make all Europe tremble.\"      STORMING OF RADYMNO    _The semi-official report dispatched by the Wolff Telegraphic Bureau  from Berlin on June 3, 1915, reads as follows:_    From the Great Headquarters we learn the following concerning the  battles at Radymno:    The corps of General von Mackensen, on the evening of the 23d of May,  stood on both sides of the San in a great bow directed toward the  east. On the right wing Bavarian troops stood on the watch facing the  northwest front of the fortress of Przemysl. In touch with the  Bavarian troops German and Austro-Hungarian forces stood south of the  San before the strongly fortified bridgehead of Radymno. Farther north  still other troops linked up with the army.    The bridgehead of Radymno consisted of a threefold line of field  works. There was in the first place the main position well provided  with wire entanglements. This ran along the heights that lie westward  of the village of Ostroro and through the low lands of the San up to  this river. Then there was a well-constructed intermediate position  which was laid through the long straggling village of Ostroro. Finally  there was the so-called bridgehead of Zagrody which was constructed  for the protection of the street and railroad bridges crossing the  river to the east of Radymno. Air-men had photographed all these  positions and had reduced the views by the photogrammeter and  transferred them to the map.    The first task was to render the enemy's main positions ripe for  attack. With this object the artillery on the afternoon of May 23  began its fire, which was continued on the next day. From the heights  near Jaroslau could be seen the valley of the San lying in the mists,  out of which jutted the cupola towers of Radymno and the hamlets of  Ostroro, Wietlin, Wysocko, etc. The artillery fire was raised to the  utmost pitch of intensity. The heavy projectiles howling, furrowed the  air, lit great fires as they struck and excavated vast pits in the  earth. The Russian artillery replied.    At six o'clock in the morning the long infantry lines rose in their  storming positions and advanced to the attack. The flyers reported  that behind the enemy's positions they observed grazing cattle and  baggage carts. The enemy seemed not to expect a serious attack.  Anyhow, the Petersburg bulletin had announced that the battles in  Galicia had decreased in intensity, that the Teutonic allies had  practically throughout gone over to the defensive.    At six-thirty in the morning the enemy's main position in its whole  extent was in the hands of the German troops. Shaken by the heavy  artillery fire the enemy had made only brief resistance; he was in  hasty retreat toward the east.    But just in that direction and into Radymno, whence the enemy's  reinforcements were to be expected, the artillery had in the meantime  turned its fire. Great clouds of smoke covered these villages set  afire by the bombardment. The Russians thus did not have the chance to  take permanent footing in Ostroro. The troops holding the town  surrendered, leaving hundreds of guns and great quantities of  ammunition in the hands of the victors.    Along the whole line the German infantry was now advancing upon  Radymno and the villages connecting with this place, Skolowszo and  Zamojsce. With every step forward the number of prisoners was  increased. Soon one division reported to headquarters that it did not  have enough men to attend to the removal of the great masses of  prisoners without prejudice to the conduct of the action. Cavalry was  therefore assigned to this task.    At Radymno the enemy's troops had become jammed in crowds. A wooden  wagon bridge over the San had been burned down too soon. From the  position of the staff directing the battle one could see the leaping  flames and the clouds of heavy black smoke caused by the pouring on of  naphtha. One could also see long columns fleeing eastward covering the  street toward Dunkowice with their disordered crowds. As the Russian  recruits which had been gathered in Radymno made only a brief  resistance, this place together with all the artillery which was  attempting to escape through the town to the San, was also lost. Only  at the bridgehead of Zagrody did the Russian leaders, by hastily  bringing up fresh reserves, finally check the attack of the Germans.  On this day 70 officers, 9,000 men, 42 machine guns, 52 cannon of  which 10 were heavy, 14 ammunition wagons, and extensive other booty  was reported. But also on the north bank of the San a great battle had  developed.      PRZEMYSL    _A semi-official dispatch by the Wolff Telegraphic Bureau dated  Berlin, June 6, said:_    From the Great Headquarters we have received the following telegram  concerning the fall of the fortress Przemysl:    When on the 2d of May the offensive of the allies in West Galicia  began, few probably could have imagined that four weeks later the  heavy guns of the Central Powers would open their fire on Przemysl.  The Russian staff was not likely to have been prepared for this  possibility. Its decision swayed this way and that, whether, as  originally planned, to hold the fortress, for \"political reasons\" or  \"voluntarily to withdraw\" from it. Constantly our airmen reported the  marching of troops in and out of the fortress. On the 21st of May the  decision seemed to have been reached to abandon it. In spite of this,  eight days later the place was stubbornly defended.    [Illustration: Eight German military positions about Przemysl and  Lemberg.]    General von Kneussl pushed the line of his Bavarian regiments from the  north closer to the fortress to shut in the foe. About eleven o'clock  in the forenoon the heavy batteries began to engage the forts on the  north front. In the night from the 30th to the 31st of May the  infantry pushed forward closer to the wire entanglements. It awaited  the effect of the heavy artillery. This confined the defenders to  their bomb-proof shelters, so that our infantry could step out of its  trenches and from the top of the breastworks watch the tremendous  drama of destruction. The lighter guns of the assailants found ideal  positions in the battery emplacements formerly built by the Russians  as part of their siege works when operating against the Austrians in  Przemysl. So, too, General von Kneussl with his staff found shelter  near, and the chief of artillery in the observation station  constructed by the Russians near Batycze. From this point, distant  from the line of forts only a little more than two kilometers, one  could observe the whole front of Forts 10 and 11. On the 31st of May,  at four in the afternoon, the heavy guns ceased firing. Simultaneously  the infantry, Bavarian regiments, a Prussian regiment and a detachment  of Austrian sharp-shooters, moved to the attack. The destruction of  the works and advanced points of support of the fortress by the heavy  artillery had such a shattering and depressing effect on its garrison  that it was not capable of offering any effective resistance to the  attacking infantry.    The troops manning Forts 10a, 11a, and 11, such of them as did not lie  buried in the shattered casemates, fled, leaving behind their entire  war material, including a great number of the newest light"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22483"],[0,"Across Unknown South America (#20)"],[1,"59  \"   400 \"    9     \"  Corumbahyba to Caldas          59  \"   400 \"    9     \"  Caldas to Pouso Alto           79  \"   200 \"   12     \"  Pouso Alto to S.

The nearest  approach to it was a filthy rest-house for muleteers, which was,  furthermore, already full. Against my usual custom--as I never, unless  absolutely necessary, make use of the credentials I carry for my private  needs--I had, therefore, to apply to the Presidente or Governor of the  Province to find some sort of accommodation in the town for my animals,  men, and myself.    \"Take off your spurs before you enter!\" roughly shouted a sentry at the  Governor's palace--a huge barn-like structure--just as I was stooping to  do that before being asked.    \"Do not stand on the pavement,\" said the sentry again, anxious to display  his authority.    Being a law-abiding person I shifted to one side.    \"Do not stop under the Presidente's window!\" cried the policeman angrily  once more, digging me in the ribs with his bayonet.    I was beginning to be sorry I had not brought an aeroplane with me in  order to complete my toilet in the air before entering so sacred a  precinct, but patience being one of my chief virtues I transferred  myself to the remotest point across the square, where, stork-like, upon  one foot at a time I was able--this time undisturbed--to remove both  spurs.    \"Take off your hat before entering,\" again shouted the policeman, as I  was still some fifteen yards from the door.    I really began to feel rather nervous, with all those orders grunted at  me. I wondered at the strange people who must visit the palace to have to  be instructed to such an extent before entering. I also stopped for a  moment to ponder whether I had taken off all that was necessary to enter  a palace where so much etiquette was required.    The moment I entered things were different. I was ushered into an  ante-room, where I had to go through a short cross-examination by some  police officers. Then, when they had made sure of my identity, they  immediately led me before the Presidente.    The Presidente greeted me with effusion. He was a most polished and  charming gentleman from Rio de Janeiro, had travelled extensively in  Europe, and could speak French and English. He roared heartily when I  told him of my experience outside his palace.    \"They are all savages here,\" he told me; \"you must not mind. The sentry  has orders to keep everybody away from the palace, as people come in the  afternoon and squat under my windows to jabber, and I cannot sleep. Those  orders, I assure you, were not meant for you. You will be my guest all  the time you are in the city, and I can accept no excuse.\"    The Presidente placed a small house near the palace at my disposal, and  insisted on my having all meals with his family--most refined, handsome,  exquisitely polite wife and daughters.    I presented the credentials I possessed from the Minister of Agriculture  in Rio and the Brazilian Ambassador in London, requesting the Presidente  to do all in his power to further the success of the expedition--I, of  course, paying all expenses. The Presidente, like most other Brazilians  of a certain age, was _blase_ beyond words. Nothing interested him except  his family, and life was not worth living. He believed in nothing. He was  an atheist because he had not been as successful as he wished in the  world, and attributed the fault to God. He cared little about the future  of his country. If his country and all his countrymen went to a warmer  place than Heaven, he would be glad to see them go that way! As for going  exploring, mapping unknown regions, studying the country and the people,  building roads, railways and telegraphs, it little mattered to him, but  it seemed all nonsense.    \"Instead of coming to these wild, deadly regions, why do you not go and  spend your money enjoying yourself in Paris or Vienna?\" was his advice to  me.    \"Perhaps I need a change occasionally, and I enjoy things all the more by  contrast when I return to Europe.\"    The Presidente was evidently not in good health and spirits. He was a  Senator of the Republic, and a man formerly of great ambitions, which  were more or less shattered when he was elected Governor of Goyaz  Province, with its population of corpses, and at a salary of L40 a  month--very little more than I paid my head muleteer--so that little  could be expected from the Governor of such a Province.    It was thus that the State of Goyaz, one of the naturally richest in  Brazil--it contained pasture lands unique for their beauty, forests with  valuable woods, plenty of water and great navigable rivers draining it  both north and south, of which it was sufficient to mention the  magnificent Araguaya River, the Rio Tocantins and the Paranahyba (or  Parana)--was instead one of the poorest. In the very heart of Brazil,  Goyaz was geographically and politically the centre of the Republic. With  an area of 747,311 sq. kil. (288,532 sq. miles), the Province had an  estimated population of some 280,000 souls, or less than one to every  square mile.    The region forming the present State of Goyaz was first explored in 1647  by Manoel Correa, a native of Sao Paulo, and in 1682 by another Paulista,  Bartholomeu Bueno de Silva, who both were prospecting for gold. The  latter was successful in locating gold mines and in making friends with  the local Indians of the Goyaz tribe, from whom the Province then took  its name. Some forty-three years later de Silva returned to Sao Paulo  with 918 ounces of gold. The news of these goldfields quickly attracted a  great number of adventurers to Goyaz. The country then saw its most  prosperous days, especially in and near Villa Boa, the present city of  Goyaz, where gold was said to have been plentiful in those days.    The enterprising Bartholomeu Bueno de Silva returned to Goyaz in 1731 as  a Capitao Mor, or Grand Captain, with the right to dispose of land. In  1822 Goyaz was recognized as a Province of the Empire, and subsequently  in 1869 it became one of the States of the Union, with autonomy as  regards local affairs under its own Constitution approved by the Federal  Constituent Assembly in 1891.    Cattle, horse and mule breeding on a small scale was the chief source of  income of that magnificent State--an income which in less indolent hands  might be increased ten-thousand-fold or more. Its horses and mules found  a ready market in the adjacent State of Matto Grosso and from there went  into Bolivia, while the States of Minas Geraes and Sao Paulo were the  chief buyers of pigs, _toucinho_ (dried pork fat), dried beef, hides raw  and cured, cheese, lard, etc.    Goyaz prided itself greatly on its horses, which enjoyed a certain fame  all over Brazil. Perhaps they were in a way as good as any produced in  the Republic. With a little study and care in the breeding they might be  greatly improved and rendered as sturdy and good-looking as some horses  of Asia and Northern Africa. So far they were far inferior in appearance  and endurance to the horses of Arabia, Turkestan, Europe and Abyssinia.    The most interesting type of the Goyaz horse was what is called the  _curraleiro_ or \"stable horse,\" bred in the north of the State,  especially in the valley of Paranan, bordering upon Minas and Bahia. The  curraleiro was also known as _cavallo sertanejo_ or \"horse of the  jungle\"--two most inappropriate names, for it was, accurately speaking,  neither one nor the other.    The Goyaz horse was a typical Brazilian horse. It shared many of the  characteristics of the people of the Province. Timidity, laziness, lack  of affection and judgment, sulkiness and great stubbornness under  training of any kind were its qualities. This was due chiefly, I think,  to its inferior intelligence when compared with thoroughbred horses of  other nations. The Goyaz horse was small, fairly agile, and when well  cared for had a handsome shiny coat with luxuriant mane and tail. It was  capable of short, noteworthy efforts, but did not possess abnormal  endurance.    The present curraleiro is a mere degeneration of what must have formerly  been an excellent horse. Considering the absolute lack of care taken in  its breeding, it was certainly remarkable that it proved to be as good a  horse as it actually was. Judiciously crossed with Hungarian, Turkestan,  Arab or Abyssinian horses, I think that quite excellent results might be  obtained. It must be taken into consideration that great hardships and  work of the roughest character were demanded of animals in Central  Brazil.    A praiseworthy movement was started some years ago by Marechal Hermes da  Fonseca, now President of the Republic, to mount the entire Brazilian  Cavalry on national horses. That will perhaps lead some day to a great  improvement in the breeding of animals all over the country, and  especially in Goyaz, which provided the most suitable land for that  purpose. The same remarks could, perhaps, in a slightly lesser degree, be  applied to the breeding of donkeys and mules. No care whatever was  exercised by the breeders in order to improve the breeds. Everything was  left to luck and chance. The result was that a degenerate type of animal  was produced--wonderful indeed, considering the way it was bred, but  which might be improved to an immense extent and made into a remarkable  animal, in such"]]]
