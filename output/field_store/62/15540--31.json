Already high for the season the waters were still rising. And all the  transportation they could collect were three ferry boats at Florence and  a few skiffs, not enough to serve all the Confederate force pushing for  that escape route.    Athens, which Forrest had occupied on the upswing of the raid, was  already back in Union hands, and the blue forces were closing in, in a  countrywide sweep, backing the gray cavalry against the river.    By the third of October Buford had the boats in action, ferrying across  men, equipment, and artillery in a steady stream of night-and-day oar  labor. The stout General, mounted on a big mule, a large animal to carry  a large man, gave the scouts new orders.    \"Try downriver, boys. We're in a pinchers here, and they may be goin' to  nip us--hard!\" He rolled a big cheroot from a Yankee commissary store  between his teeth, watching the wind whip the surface of the river into  good-sized waves about the laboring boats. \"Anything usable below  Florence ... we want to know about it, and quick!\"    Wilkins led them out at a steady trot. \"We'll take a look around  Newport. Rough going, but I think I remember a place.\"    However, the possibilities of Wilkins' \"place\" did not seem too  promising to Drew when they came out on a steep bluff some miles down  the Tennessee.    \"This is a heller of a river,\" Kirby expressed his opinion forcibly.  \"Always spittin' back in an hombre's face. We've had plenty of trouble  with it before.\"    They were on a bank above a slough which was not more than two hundred  feet wide. And beyond that was an island thickly overgrown with cane,  oak, and hickory. The upper end of that was sandy, matted with  driftwood, some of it partially afloat again.    \"Use that for a steppin' stone?\" Drew asked.    \"Best we're goin' to find. And if time's runnin' out, we'll be glad to  have it. Rennie, report in. We'll do some more scoutin', just to make  sure there'll be no surprises later.\"    For more than thirty-six hours Buford had been ferrying. Artillery,  wagons, and a large portion of his division were safely across. When  Drew returned to the uproar along the river he found that the second  half of the retreating forces, commanded by Forrest, were in town. And  it was to Forrest that Drew was ordered to deliver his report.    He would never forget the first glimpse he'd had of Bedford Forrest--the  officer sitting his big gray charger in the midst of a battle, whirling  his standard to attract a broken rabble of men, knitting out of them, by  sheer force of personality, a refreshed, striking force. Now Drew found  himself facing quite a different person--a big, quiet, soft-spoken man  who eyed the scout with gray-blue eyes.    \"You're Rennie, one of that Morgan company who joined at Harrisburg.\"    \"Yes, suh.\"    \"Morgan's men fought at Chickamauga ... good men, good fighters. Said so  then, never had any reason to change that. Now what's this about an  island downriver?\"    Drew explained tersely, for he had a good idea that General Forrest  wanted no wasting of time. Then at request he drew a rough sketch of the  island and its approaches. Forrest studied it.    \"Something to keep in mind. But I want to know that it's clear. You boys  picket it. If there's any Union movement about, report it at once!\"    \"Yes, suh.\"    If Yankee scouts had sighted the island, either they had not reported it  or their superiors had not calculated what its value might be for hunted  men--and to a leader who was used to improvising and carrying through  more improbable projects than the one the island suggested.    At Shoal Creek a rear guard was holding off the Union advance which had  started from Athens, the two pronged pinchers General Buford had  foreseen. And now the island came into use.    Saddles and equipment were stripped from horses and piled into the boats  brought down from Florence. Then the mounts were driven to the top of  the bluff and over into the water some twenty feet below. Leaders of  that leap were caught by their halters and towed behind the boats, the  others swimming after.    Men and mounts burrowed back into the concealment of those thick  canebrakes and were hidden along the southern shore of the overgrown  strip of water-enclosed land. The Union pursuers came up on the bluff,  but they did not see the ferrying from the south bank of the island,  ferrying which kept up night and day for some forty-eight hours.    \"Cold!\" Kirby and Drew crouched together behind a screen of cane on the  north side of the island, watching the bank above for any hostile move  on the part of the enemy.    \"General Forrest says no fires.\"    \"Yeah. You know, I jus' don't like this heah spread of water.  This is the second time I've had to git across it with Old Man  Death-an'-Disaster raisin' dust from my rump with a double of his  encouragin' rope. Seems like the Tennessee ain't partial to raidin'  parties.\"    \"Makes a good barrier when we're on the other side,\" Drew pointed out  reasonably.    \"So--\"    Drew's Colt was already out, Kirby's carbine at ready. But the man who  had cat-footed it through the cane was General Forrest himself.    \"I thought\"--the General eyed them both--\"I would catch some of you  young fools loafin' back heah as if nothin' was goin' on. If you don't  want to roost heah all winter, you'd better come along. Last boats are  leavin' now.\"    As they scrambled after their commander Drew realized that the General  had made it his personal business to make sure none of the north side  pickets were left behind in the last-minute withdrawal.    They piled into one of the waiting boats, catching up poles. Forrest  took another. Then he balanced where he stood, glaring toward the bow of  the boat. A lieutenant was there, his hands empty.    \"You ... Mistuh--\" Forrest's voice took on the ring Drew had heard at  Harrisburg. \"Wheah's your oar, Mistuh?\"    The man was startled. \"As an officer, suh--\"    Still gripping his pole with one hand, the General swung out a long arm,  catching the lieutenant hard on one cheek with enough force to send him  over the gunwale into the river. The lieutenant splashed, flailing out  his arms, until he caught at the pole Drew extended to him. As they  hauled him aboard again, the General snorted.    \"Now you, Mistuh officer, take that oar theah and git to work! If I have  to knock you over again, you can just stay in. We shall all pull out of  this together!\"    The lieutenant bent to the oar hastily as they moved out into the full  current of the river.          10    _\"Dismount! Prepare To Fight Gunboats!\"_      \"Drew!\"    He turned his head on the saddle which served him as a temporary pillow  and was aware of the smell of mule, strong, and the smell of a wood  fire, less strong, and last of all, of corn bread baked in the husk,  and, not so familiar, bacon frying--all the aromas of camp--with the  addition of food which could be, and had been on occasion, very  temporary. Squinting his smarting eyes against the sun's glare, Drew sat  up. With four days of hard riding by night and scouting by day only a  few hours behind him, he was still extremely weary.    Boyd squatted by his side, a folded sheet of paper in his hand.    \"... letter ...\"    Drew must have missed part during his awakening. Now he turned away from  the sun and tried to pay better attention.    \"From who?\" he asked rustily.    \"Mother. She got the one you sent from Meridian, Drew! And when Crosely  went home for a horse she gave him these to bring back through the  lines. Drew, your grandfather's dead....\"    Odd, he did not feel anything at all at that news. When he was little he  had been afraid of Alexander Mattock. Then he had faced out his fear and  all the other emotions bred in him during those years of being Hunt  Rennie's son in a house where Hunt Rennie was a symbol of black hatred;  he had faced up to his grandfather on the night he left Red Springs to  join the army in '62. And then Drew had discovered that he was free. He  had seen his grandfather as he would always remember him now, an old man  eaten up by his hatred, soured by acts Drew knew would never be  explained. And from that moment, grandfather and grandson were  strangers. Now, well, now he wished--for just a fleeting second or  two--that he did know what lay behind all that rage and waste and  blackness in the past. Alexander Mattock had been a respected man. As  hardly more than a boy he had followed Andy Jackson down to New Orleans  and helped break the last vestige of British power in the Gulf. He had  bred fine horses, loved the land, and his word was better than most  men's sworn oaths. He had had a liking for books, and had served his  country in Congress, and could even have been governor had he not  declined the nomination. He was a big man, in many ways a great and  honorable man. Drew could admit that, now that he had made a life for  himself beyond Alexander Mattock's shadow. A great man ... who had hated  his own grandson.    \"This is yours....\" Boyd pulled a second sheet from the folds of the  first. Drew smoothed it out to read:         My dear boy:         Your letter from Meridian reached me just two days ago, having been       many weeks on the way, and I am taking advantage of Henry Crosely's       presence home on leave to reply. I want you to know that I do not,       in any way, consider you to blame for Boyd's joining General organ's       command. He had long been restless here, and it was only a matter of       time and chance before he followed his brother.         I know that you must have done all that you could to dissuade him       after your aunt's appeal to you, but I had already accepted failure       on this point. Just as I know that it was your efforts which       established him under good care in Meridian. Do not, Drew,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23644"],[0,"Marjorie Dean, High School Freshman (#20)"],[1,"the beginning of the last act that Marjorie heard the story of the  fourth member of the Stevenses' household, little lame Charlie.    \"Charlie has been with us a little over four years,\" returned Constance,  in answer to Marjorie's interested questions. \"He is seven years old,  but you would hardly believe it. His mother died when he was a tiny  baby, and his father was a dreadful drunkard. He was a musician, too, a  clarionet player. He let Charlie fall downstairs when he was only two  years old and hurt his hip. That's why he's lame. His father used to go  away and be gone for days and leave the poor baby with his neighbors.  Father found out about it and took Charlie away from him, and we've had  him with us ever since.\"    \"It was splendid in your father to be so good to the poor old man and  Charlie,\" said Marjorie, warmly.    \"Father is the best man in the world,\" returned Constance, with fond  pride. \"He is such a wonderful musician, too. He can play on the violin  as well as the piano, and he teaches both. If only he could get plenty  of work here in Sanford. He has a few pupils, and with the articles he  writes we manage to live, but the magazine is a small one and does not  pay much for them. He has tried ever so many times to get into the  theatre orchestra, but there seems to be no chance for him. I think  we'll go somewhere else to live before long. Perhaps to a big city  again. I'd love to stay here and go through high school with you, but I  am afraid I can't. I'm almost eighteen and I ought to work.\"    \"Oh, you mustn't think of leaving Sanford!\" exclaimed Marjorie, in  sudden dismay. \"What would I do without you? Perhaps things will be  brighter after a while. I am sure they will. Why couldn't your  father----\"    But the last act was on, and she did not finish what had promised to be  a suggestion. Nevertheless, a plan had taken shape in her busy mind,  which she determined to discuss with her father and mother.    As if to further her design they found Mr. Stevens waiting outside the  theatre for his daughter and Marjorie lost no time in presenting him to  her father and mother. He greeted the Deans gravely, thanking them for  their kindness to his daughter, with a fine courtesy that made a marked  impression on them, and after he had gone his way, a happy, smiling  Constance beside him, Marjorie slipped her arms in those of her father  and mother, and walking between them told Constance's story all over  again.    \"I think it is positively noble in Mr. Stevens to take care of that old  man and little Charlie, when they have no claim upon him,\" she finished.    \"He has a remarkably fine, sensitive face,\" said Mrs. Dean. \"I suppose  like nearly all persons of great musical gifts, he lacks the commercial  ability to manage his affairs successfully.\"    \"Don't you believe that if the people of Sanford only knew how  beautifully Mr. Stevens and the other man played together they might  hire them for afternoon teas and little parties and such things?\" asked  Marjorie, with an earnestness that made her father say teasingly, \"Are  you going to enlist in his cause as his business manager?\"    \"You mustn't tease me, General,\" she reproved. \"I'm in dead earnest. I  was just thinking to-night that Mr. Stevens ought to have an orchestra  of his own. You know mother promised me a party on my birthday, and  that's not until January tenth. Why can't I have it the night before  Thanksgiving? That will be next Wednesday. Mr. Stevens and Mr. Roland  can play for us to dance. A violin and piano will be plenty of music. If  everybody likes my orchestra, then someone will be sure to want to hire  it for some of the holiday parties. Don't you think that a nice plan?\"    \"Very,\" laughed her father. \"I see you have an eye to business,  Lieutenant.\"    \"You can have your party next week, if you like, dear,\" agreed Mrs.  Dean, who made it a point always to encourage her daughter's generous  impulses.    \"Then I'll send my invitations to-morrow,\" exulted Marjorie. \"Hurrah for  the Stevens orchestra! Long may it wave!\" She gave a joyous skip that  caused her father to exclaim \"Steady!\" and her mother to protest against  further jolting.    \"Beg your pardon, both of you,\" apologized the frisky lieutenant, giving  the arms to which she clung an affectionate squeeze, \"but I simply had  to rejoice a little. Won't Constance be glad? I could never care quite  so much for Constance as I do for Mary, but I like her next best. She's  a dear and we're going to be friends as long as we live.\"    But clouds have an uncomfortable habit of darkening the clearest skies  and even sworn friendships are not always timeproof.          CHAPTER XVII    MARJORIE MEETS WITH A LOSS      By eight o'clock the following night twenty-eight invitations to  Marjorie Dean's Thanksgiving party were on their way. No one of the  invitations ran the risk of being declined. Marjorie had invited only  those boys and girls of her acquaintance who were quite likely to come  and when the momentous evening arrived they put in twenty-eight joyful  appearances and enjoyed the Deans' hospitality to the full.    But to Constance, who wore her beautiful blue gown and went to the party  under the protection of her father, whose somber eyes gleamed with a  strange new happiness, and old John Roland, whose usually vacant  expression had changed to one of inordinate pride, it was, indeed, a  night to be remembered by the three. Charlie was to remain at home in  the care of a kindly neighbor.    The long living-room had been stripped of everything save the piano, and  the polished hardwood floor was ideal to dance on. Uncle John had  received careful instructions beforehand from both Mr. Stevens and  Constance as to his behavior, and with a sudden flash of reason in his  faded eyes had gravely promised to \"be good.\"    He had kept his word, too, and from his station beside the piano he had  played like one inspired from the moment his violin sang the first magic  strains of the \"Blue Danube\" until it crooned softly the \"Home, Sweet  Home\" waltz.    The dancers were wholly appreciative of the orchestra, as their coaxing  applause for more music after every number testified, and before the  evening was over several boys and girls had asked Marjorie if \"those  dandy musicians\" would play for anyone who wanted them.    \"Mother's giving a tea next week, and I'm going to tell her about these  men,\" the Crane had informed Marjorie.    \"Hal and I are going to give a party before long, and we'll have them,  too,\" Jerry had promised. Lawrence Armitage, who had managed to be found  near Constance the greater part of the evening, insisted on being  introduced to her father, and during supper, which was served at small  tables in the dining-room, he had sat at the same table with the two  players and Constance, and kept up an animated and interested discussion  on music with Mr. Stevens.    But the crowning moment of the evening had been when, after supper, the  guests had gathered in the living-room to do stunts, and Constance had  sung Tosti's \"Good-bye\" and \"Thy Blue Eyes,\" her exquisite voice coming  as a bewildering surprise to the assembled young people. How they had  crowded around her afterward! How glad Marjorie had been at the success  of her plan, and how Mr. Stevens' eyes had shone to hear his daughter  praised by her classmates!    In less than a week afterward Constance rose from obscurity to  semi-popularity. The story of her singing was noised about through  school until it reached even the ears of the girls who had despised her  for her poverty. Muriel and Susan had looked absolute amazement when a  talkative freshman told the news as she received it from a girl who had  attended the party. Mignon, however, was secretly furious at the, to  her, unbelievable report that \"that beggarly Stevens girl could actually  sing.\" She had never forgiven Constance for refusing to dishonorably  assist her in an algebra test, and after her unsuccessful attempt to  fasten the disappearance of her bracelet upon Constance she had disliked  her with that fierce hatred which the transgressor so often feels for  the one he or she has wronged.    Next to Constance in Mignon's black book came Marjorie, who had caused  her to lose her proud position of center on the team, and in Miss Merton  and Marcia Arnold she had two staunch adherents. Just why Miss Merton  disliked Marjorie was hard to say. Perhaps she took violent exception to  the girl's gay, gracious manner and love of life, the early years of  which she was living so abundantly. At any rate, she never lost an  opportunity to harass or annoy the pretty freshman, and it was only by  keeping up an eternal vigilance that Marjorie managed to escape  constant, nagging reproof.    Last of all, Marcia Arnold had a grievance against Marjorie. She was no  longer manager of the freshman team. A disagreeable ten minutes with  Miss Archer after the freshman team had been disbanded, on that dreadful  day, had been sufficient to deprive her of her office, and arouse her  resentment against Marjorie to a fever pitch.    There were still a number of girls in the freshman class who clung to  Muriel and Mignon, but they were in the minority. At least two-thirds of  19-- had made friendly overtures not only to Marjorie, but to Constance  as well, and as the short December days slipped by, Marjorie began to  experience a contentment and peace in her school that she had not felt  since leaving dear old Franklin High.    \"Everything's going beautifully, Captain,\" she declared gaily to her  mother in answer to the latter's question, as she flashed into the  living-room one sunny winter afternoon, with dancing eyes and pink  cheeks. \"It couldn't be better. I like almost every one in school;  Constance's father has more playing than he can do; you bought me that  darling collar and cuff set yesterday; I've a long letter from Mary;  I've studied"]]]
