He therefore hopped  down from his branch, vivified the body, and began to return the woman's  caresses. But as Jayashri bent down to kiss his lips, he caught the end  of her nose in his teeth, and bit it clean off. He then issued from the  corpse, and returned to the branch where he had been sitting.    Jayashri was in despair. She did not, however, lose her presence of  mind, but sat down and proceeded to take thought; and when she had  matured her plan she arose, dripping with blood, and walked straight  home to her husband's house. On entering his room she clapped her hand  to her nose, and began to gnash her teeth, and to shriek so violently,  that all the members of the family were alarmed. The neighbours also  collected in numbers at the door, and, as it was bolted inside, they  broke it open and rushed in, carrying lights. There they saw the  wife sitting upon the ground with her face mutilated, and the husband  standing over her, apparently trying to appease her.    \"O ignorant, criminal, shameless, pitiless wretch!\" cried the people,  especially the women; \"why hast thou cut off her nose, she not having  offended in any way?\"    Poor Shridat, seeing at once the trick which had been played upon him,  thought to himself: \"One should put no confidence in a changeful mind, a  black serpent, or an armed enemy, and one should dread a woman's doings.  What cannot a poet describe? What is there that a saint (jogi) does not  know? What nonsense will not a drunken man talk? What limit is there to  a woman's guile? True it is that the gods know nothing of the defects of  a horse, of the thundering of clouds, of a woman's deeds, or of a man's  future fortunes. How then can we know?\" He could do nothing but weep,  and swear by the herb basil, by his cattle, by his grain, by a piece of  gold, and by all that is holy, that he had not committed the crime.    In the meanwhile, the old merchant, Jayashri's father, ran off, and laid  a complaint before the kotwal, and the footmen of the police magistrate  were immediately sent to apprehend the husband, and to carry him bound  before the judge. The latter, after due examination, laid the affair  before the king. An example happening to be necessary at the time, the  king resolved to punish the offence with severity, and he summoned the  husband and wife to the court.    When the merchant's daughter was asked to give an account of what had  happened, she pointed out the state of her nose, and said, \"Maharaj! why  inquire of me concerning what is so manifest?\" The king then turned to  the husband, and bade him state his defence. He said, \"I know nothing of  it,\" and in the face of the strongest evidence he persisted in denying  his guilt.    Thereupon the king, who had vainly threatened to cut off Shridat's  right hand, infuriated by his refusing to confess and to beg for  mercy, exclaimed, \"How must I punish such a wretch as thou art?\" The  unfortunate man answered, \"Whatever your majesty may consider just, that  be pleased to do.\" Thereupon the king cried, \"Away with him, and impale  him\"; and the people, hearing the command, prepared to obey it.    Before Shridat had left the court, the footpad, who had been looking  on, and who saw that an innocent man was about to be unjustly punished,  raised a cry for justice and, pushing through the crowd, resolved to  make himself heard. He thus addressed the throne: \"Great king, the  cherishing of the good, and the punishment of the bad, is the invariable  duty of kings.\" The ruler having caused him to approach, asked him who  he was, and he replied boldly, \"Maharaj! I am a thief, and this man is  innocent and his blood is about to be shed unjustly. Your majesty has  not done what is right in this affair.\" Thereupon the king charged  him to tell the truth according to his religion; and the thief related  explicitly the whole circumstances, omitting of course, the murder.    \"Go ye,\" said the king to his messengers, \"and look in the mouth of the  woman's lover who has fallen dead. If the nose be there found, then has  this thief-witness told the truth, and the husband is a guiltless man.\"    The nose was presently produced in court, and Shridat escaped the stake.  The king caused the wicked Jayashri's face to be smeared with oily soot,  and her head and eyebrows to be shaved; thus blackened and disfigured,  she was mounted upon a little ragged-limbed ass and was led around the  market and the streets, after which she was banished for ever from the  city. The husband and the thief were then dismissed with betel and other  gifts, together with much sage advice which neither of them wanted.    \"My king,\" resumed the misogyne parrot, \"of such excellencies as these  are women composed. It is said that 'wet cloth will extinguish fire and  bad food will destroy strength; a degenerate son ruins a family,  and when a friend is in wrath he takes away life. But a woman is an  inflicter of grief in love and in hate, whatever she does turns out to  be for our ill. Truly the Deity has created woman a strange being in  this world.' And again, 'The beauty of the nightingale is its song,  science is the beauty of an ugly man, forgiveness is the beauty of a  devotee, and the beauty of a woman is virtue-but where shall we find  it?' And again, 'Among the sages, Narudu; among the beasts, the jackal;  among the birds, the crow; among men, the barber; and in this world  woman-is the most crafty.'    \"What I have told thee, my king, I have seen with mine own eyes, and I  have heard with mine own ears. At the time I was young, but the event  so affected me that I have ever since held female kind to be a walking  pest, a two-legged plague, whose mission on earth, like flies and other  vermin, is only to prevent our being too happy. O, why do not children  and young parrots sprout in crops from the ground-from budding trees or  vinestocks?\"    \"I was thinking, sire,\" said the young Dharma Dhwaj to the warrior king  his father, \"what women would say of us if they could compose Sanskrit  verses!\"    \"Then keep your thoughts to yourself,\" replied the Raja, nettled at his  son daring to say a word in favour of the sex. \"You always take the part  of wickedness and depravity---\"    \"Permit me, your majesty,\" interrupted the Baital, \"to conclude my  tale.\"    When Madan-manjari, the jay, and Churaman, the parrot, had given these  illustrations of their belief, they began to wrangle, and words ran  high. The former insisted that females are the salt of the earth,  speaking, I presume, figuratively. The latter went so far as to assert  that the opposite sex have no souls, and that their brains are in a  rudimental and inchoate state of development. Thereupon he was tartly  taken to task by his master's bride, the beautiful Chandravati, who told  him that those only have a bad opinion of women who have associated with  none but the vicious and the low, and that he should be ashamed to abuse  feminine parrots, because his mother had been one.    This was truly logical.    On the other hand, the jay was sternly reproved for her mutinous and  treasonable assertions by the husband of her mistress, Raja Ram, who,  although still a bridegroom, had not forgotten the gallant rule of his  syntax--                   The masculine is more worthy than the feminine;    till Madan-manjari burst into tears and declared that her life was not  worth having. And Raja Ram looked at her as if he could have wrung her  neck.    In short, Raja Vikram, all the four lost their tempers, and with them  what little wits they had. Two of them were but birds, and the others  seem not to have been much better, being young, ignorant, inexperienced,  and lately married. How then could they decide so difficult a question  as that of the relative wickedness and villany of men and women? Had  your majesty been there, the knot of uncertainty would soon have been  undone by the trenchant edge of your wit and wisdom, your knowledge and  experience. You have, of course, long since made up your mind upon the  subject?    Dharma Dhwaj would have prevented his father's reply. But the youth had  been twice reprehended in the course of this tale, and he thought it  wisest to let things take their own way.    \"Women,\" quoth the Raja, oracularly, \"are worse than we are; a man,  however depraved he may be, ever retains some notion of right and wrong,  but a woman does not. She has no such regard whatever.\"    \"The beautiful Bangalah Rani for instance?\" said the Baital, with a  demonaic sneer.    At the mention of a word, the uttering of which was punishable by  extirpation of the tongue, Raja Vikram's brain whirled with rage. He  staggered in the violence of his passion, and putting forth both hands  to break his fall, he dropped the bundle from his back. Then the Baital,  disentangling himself and laughing lustily, ran off towards the tree as  fast as his thin brown legs would carry him. But his activity availed  him little.    The king, puffing with fury, followed him at the top of his speed, and  caught him by his tail before he reached the siras-tree, hurled him  backwards with force, put foot upon his chest, and after shaking out the  cloth, rolled him up in it with extreme violence, bumped his back half  a dozen times against the stony ground, and finally, with a jerk, threw  him on his shoulder, as he had done before.    The young prince, afraid to accompany his father whilst he was pursuing  the fiend, followed slowly in the rear, and did not join him for some  minutes.    But when matters were in their normal state, the Vampire, who had  endured with exemplary patience the penalty of his impudence, began in  honeyed accents,    \"Listen, O warrior king, whilst thy servant recounts unto thee another  true tale.\"          THE VAMPIRE'S THIRD STORY -- Of a High-minded Family.    In"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24001"],[0,"The Physical Life of Woman: Advice to the Maiden, Wife and Mother (#20)"],[1," crime of  _abortion_ is appallingly rife in our day; it is abroad in our land to  an extent which would have shocked the dissolute women of pagan Rome.  Testimony from all quarters, especially from New England, has  accumulated within the past few years to sap our faith in the morality  and religion of American women. This wholesale, fashionable murder, how  are we to stop it? Hundreds of vile men and women in our large cities  subsist by this slaughter of the innocents, and flaunt their ill-gotten  gains--the price of blood--in our public thoroughfares. Their  advertisements are seen in the newspapers; their soul and body  destroying means are hawked in every town. With such temptation strewn  in her path, what will the woman threatened with an excessive family  do? Will she not yield to evil, and sear her conscience with the  repetition of her wickedness? Alas! daily experience in the heart of a  great city discloses to us only too frequently the fatal ease of such a  course.    In view of the injuries of excessive child-bearing on the one hand, and  of this prevalent crime on the other, a man of genius and sympathy, Dr.  Raciborski of Paris, took the position that the avoidance of offspring  to a certain extent is not only legitimate, but should be recommended as  a measure of public good. 'We know how bitterly we shall be attacked,'  he says, 'for promulgating this doctrine; but if our ideas only render  to society the services we expect of them, we shall have effaced from  the list of crimes the one most atrocious without exception, that of  child-murder, before or after birth, and we shall have poured a little  happiness into the bosoms of despairing families, where poverty is  allied to the knowledge that offspring can be born only to prostitution  or mendicity. The realization of such hopes will console us under the  attacks upon our doctrines.'    It has been eagerly repeated by some, that the wish to limit offspring  arises most frequently from an inordinate desire of indulgence. We reply  to such, that they do not know the human heart, and that they do it  discredit. More frequently the wish springs from a love of children. The  parents seek to avoid having more than they can properly nourish and  educate. They do not wish to leave their sons and daughters in want.  'This,' says a writer in _The Nation_ (of New York), in an article on  this interesting subject,--'this is not the noblest motive of action, of  course, but there is something finely human about it.'    'Very much indeed is it to be wished,' says Dr. Edward Reich, after  reviewing the multitudinous evils which result to individuals and  society from a too rapid increase in families, 'that the function of  reproduction be placed under the dominion of the will.'    Men are very ready to find an excuse for self-indulgence; and if they  cannot get one anywhere else, they seek it in religion. They tell the  woman it is her duty to bear all the children she can. They refer her to  the sturdy, strong-limbed women of early times, to the peasant women of  northern Europe, who emigrate to America, and ask and expect their wives  to rival them in fecundity. Such do not reflect that they have been  brought up to light indoor employment, that their organization is more  nervous and frail, that they absolutely have not the stamina required  for many confinements.    Moreover, they presume too much in asking her to bear them. 'If a woman  has a right to decide on any question,' said a genial physician in the  Massachusetts Medical Society a few years since, 'it certainly is as to  how many children she shall bear.' 'Certainly,' say the editors of a  prominent medical journal, 'wives have a right to demand of their  husbands at least the same consideration which a breeder extends to his  stock.' 'Whenever it becomes unwise that the family should be  increased,' says Sismondi again, '_justice_ and _humanity_ require that  the husband should impose on himself the same restraint which is  submitted to by the unmarried.'    An eminent writer on medical statistics, Dr. Henry MacCormac, says: 'The  brute yields to the generative impulse when it is experienced. He is  troubled by no compunction about the matter. Now, a man ought not to act  like a brute. He has reason to guide and control his appetites. Too  many, however, forget, and act like brutes instead of as men. It would,  in effect, prove very greatly conducive to man's interests were the  generative impulses placed absolutely under the sway of right reason,  chastity, forecast, and justice.'    There is no lack of authorities, medical and non-medical, on this point.  Few who weigh them well will deny that there is such a thing as too  large a family; that there does come a time when a mother can rightfully  demand rest from her labours, in the interest of herself, her children,  and society. When is this time? Here again the impossibility meets us of  stating a definite number of children, and saying, 'This many and no  more.' As in every other department of medicine, averages are of no  avail in guiding individuals. There are women who require no limitation  whatever. They can bear healthy children with rapidity, and suffer no  ill results. There are others--and they are the majority--who should use  temperance in this as in every other function; and there are a few who  should bear no children at all. It is absurd for physicians or  theologians to insist that it is either the physical or moral duty of  the female to have as many children as she possibly can have. It is  time that such an injurious prejudice was discarded, and the truth  recognised, that while marriage looks to offspring as its natural  sequence, there should be inculcated such a thing as marital continence,  and that excess here as elsewhere is repugnant to morality, and is  visited by the laws of physiology with certain and severe punishment on  parent and child.    Continence, self-control, a willingness to deny himself,--that is what  is required from the husband. But a thousand voices reach us from  suffering women in all parts of our land that this will not suffice;  that men refuse thus to restrain themselves; that it leads to a loss of  domestic happiness and to illegal amours, or that it is injurious  physically and mentally,--that, in short, such advice is useless,  because impracticable.    To such sufferers we reply that Nature herself has provided to some  extent against over-production, and that it is well to avail ourselves  of her provisions. It is well known that women when nursing rarely  become pregnant, and for this reason, if for no other, women should  nurse their own children, and continue the period until the child is at  least a year old. Be it remembered, however, that nursing, continued too  long, weakens both mother and child, and, moreover, ceases to accomplish  the end for which we now recommend it.    Another provision of nature is, that for a certain period between her  monthly illnesses every woman is sterile. The vesicle which matures in  her ovaries, and is discharged from them by menstruation, remains some  days in the womb before it is passed forth and lost. How long its stay  is we do not definitely know, and probably it differs in individuals.  From ten to twelve days at most are supposed to elapse after the  _cessation_ of the flow before the final ejection of the vesicle. For  some days after this the female is incapable of reproduction. But for  some days _before_ her monthly illness she is liable to conception, as  for that length of time the male element can survive. This period,  therefore, becomes a variable and an undetermined one, and even when  known, its observation demands a large amount of self-control.    There is one method widely in use in this country for the limitation of  offspring which deserves only the most unqualified condemnation, which  is certain to bring upon the perpetrators swift and terrible  retribution, and which is opposed to every sentiment of nature and  morality. We mean      THE CRIME OF ABORTION.    _From the moment of conception_ a new life commences; a new individual  exists; another child is added to the family. The mother who  deliberately sets about to destroy this life, either by want of care, or  by taking drugs, or using instruments, commits as great a crime, is just  as guilty, as if she strangled her new-born infant, or as if she  snatched from her own breast her six-months' darling and dashed out its  brains against the wall. Its blood is upon her head, and as sure as  there is a God and a judgment, that blood will be required of her. The  crime she commits is _murder_, _child-murder_,--the slaughter of a  speechless, helpless being, whom it is her duty, beyond all things else,  to cherish and preserve.    This crime is common; it is fearfully prevalent. Hundreds of persons are  devoted to its perpetration. It is their trade. In nearly every village  its ministers stretch out their bloody hands to lead the weak woman to  suffering, remorse, and death. Those who submit to their treatment are  not generally unmarried women who have lost their virtue, but the  mothers of families, respectable _Christian_ matrons, members of  churches, and walking in the better classes of society.    We appeal to all such with earnest and with threatening words. If they  have no feeling for the fruit of their womb, if maternal sentiment is so  callous in their breasts, let them know that such produced abortions are  the constant cause of violent and dangerous womb diseases, and  frequently of early death; that they bring on mental weakness, and often  insanity; that they are the most certain means to destroy domestic  happiness which can be adopted. Better, far better, to bear a child  every year for twenty years than to resort to such a wicked and  injurious step; better to die, if needs be, in the pangs of childbirth,  than to live with such a weight of sin"]]]
