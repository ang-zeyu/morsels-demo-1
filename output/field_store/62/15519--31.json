They chat in  subdued voices, people all do here, I suppose it's something in the sea  warm air--have you ever noticed how softly they talk in the Scilly Isles  at night? It is the same cause I expect--the soft warm atmosphere. They  smoke Occidental (American) cigarettes after the manner of all the wise  men of the East of to-day. A yard or so along is a bearded turbaned  native; he is from up North I think. He sits on the parapet with knees  under his chin, and a fierceness of expression that is quite refreshing  after the monotonous negatively gentle expression of the Bombay  natives; then beyond him are two Eurasian girls in straw hats and white  frocks, and they do look so proper. Further over the Parsi men in almost  European kit with their women folk sit in lines of victorias and  broughams, and they are silhouetted against the glow of lamps on the  lawn of the Yacht Club, under which the white women from the far  North-West listen to music and have tea and iced drinks through straws.  And the local Parsis _seem_ quite content eating the air in the  dusk--one or two of their menkind pay visits on foot from carriage to  carriage--they have at least a share in the pom pom of the brass  band--and welcome.    By the way, my piper friends who may read this, you will be amused to  hear some natives of Sassun objected to having the pipes on the lawn in  the afternoon at the Yacht Club--said they \"couldn't hear any music in  them\"--so Queen Victoria's favourite, \"The Green Hills of Tyroll\" was  turned on, in parts, and they were quite happy!    Now dinner, for there goes the Hotel brass band down below--_a cada  necio agrada su porrada_--to me the pipes, the brass band to the  Southerner, but for us all dinner--\"both meat and music,\" as the fox  said when it ate the bagpipes.[7]    [7] To each fool agreeable is his folly; and, the bag of the pipes is  made of sheep-skin you see.    [Illustration]    We have home letters to-night; \"The Mail\" they speak of over the Indian  Peninsula has arrived. G.'s maid has a letter from St Abbs from her  mother, who is anxious about her, for she says, \"There's an awfu' heavy  sea running at the Head.\" Even at this distance of time and sea miles,  we find home news takes a new importance, and are already grateful for  home letters with details of what is going on there from day to day;  trifles there, are interesting to read about here, there's the  enchantment of distance about them, and they become important by their  isolation.       .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .    Nov. 22nd.--We conclude, that considering packing, calling on Cook, and  a complete absence of any Royal function or Tomasha of any sort, that we  have put in a most excellent day, in fact the best day we have had since  we landed--and it was spent at sea!--at least the best of it was. I  visited the Sailors' Home in the morning, which is a palace here where a  sailor man who has the money, and doesn't mind the loneliness and ennui,  can live like a prince for a rupee a day, and as comfortably or more so  than we can in the Taj for heaps of rupees. Perhaps it was the  suggestion of being at anchor in that refuge that made G. and me go off  to sea this afternoon, and we are glad we did so. We looked at a steam  launch opposite the Hotel which was full of white passengers seated  shoulder to shoulder round the stern like soldiers; they were bound for  Elephanta and the caves there, and we decided to go too; but they seemed  so awfully hot even in shadow of an awning, and so packed and formal  that we elected to take time and sail, in a boat of our own, with our  own particular piratical crew, and lateen sails, and white awning. We  were warned we might have to stay out till late at night! As it is said  to be seven miles, I thought with a crew of four men, Krishna, and  myself, we might by an effort even row home in time for dinner though it  did fall calm!    So we chartered the craft for seven rupees there and back--which was two  rupees above proper rate--left our packing undone, and sailed for  Elephanta. It was altogether delightful being on the water again the  first time for many months--of course being on board a P. & O. steamer  doesn't count, as that hardly conveys even the feeling of being afloat.  The breeze was light and southerly, so at first we rowed, and the cheery  dark faces of the crew beamed and sweated. These coast men are nicer to  look at than the natives on shore. They did buck in with their funny  bamboo oars, long things like bakers' bread shovels, with square or  round blades tied with string to the end of a bamboo, which worked in a  hemp grummet on a single wooden thole pin.    What a study they make! Bow, Two and Three, have skull-caps of lemon  yellow and dull gold thread, and blue dungaree jackets faded and  threadbare. They are young lusty fellows, and Stroke, who is a  tough-looking, middle-aged man, with a wiry beard, has a skull-cap  between rose and brown, and round it a salmon-coloured wisp of a  turban--over them there is the arch of the frogged foot of the lateen  sail. All but Bow are in full sunlight, sweating at their oars, he is in  the shadow the sail casts on our bow. We recline, to quote our  upholsterer, in \"cairless elegance\" on the floor of the stern, on Turkey  red cushions under the shadow of the awning, and I feel sorry we have  spent so much time on shore.    We pass under the high stern of a lumbering native craft; its grey  sun-bitten woodwork is loosely put together: on a collection of dried  palm leaves and coir ropes on the stern, sit the naked, brown crew  feeding off a bunch of green bananas. One has a pink skull-cap, and at a  porthole below the counter the red glass of a side-light catches the sun  and glows a fine ruby red; a pleasant contrast to the grey, sun-dried  woodwork. Just as we clear our eyes off her, from seaward behind us  comes an Arab dhow, a ship from the past, surging along finely! An  out-and-out pirate, you can tell at a glance, even though she does fly a  square red flag astern with a white edge. Her bows are viking or  saucer-shaped, prettier than the usual fiddle-bow we see here, and her  high bulwarks on her long sloping quarter deck you feel must conceal  brass guns. From beyond her the afternoon sun sends the shadows of her  mast and stays in fine curves down the bend of her sail, the jib-boom is  inboard and the jib flat against the lee of the main sail. She brings  up the breeze with her, and our bamboo oars are pulled in and we go  slipping across the water in silence, only the bows talking to the small  waves. Now, how sorry we feel for those other globe trotters on the  launch, birring along behind a hot, bubbling, puffing, steam kettle--and  so crowded, and in this heat too, whilst we extend at our ease in a  white and sky-blue boat, with pink cushions, and dreamily listen to the  silky frou frou of the southern sea. The crew rest; and one brings out  the hubble-bubble from the peak, with a burning coal on the bowl; it is  passed round and each of them takes three or four long inhalations  through his hands over the mouth-piece, to avoid touching it with his  lips, and the smell of the tobacco is not unpleasant, diluted as it is  with the tropical sea air. Now it is brought aft to the oldest of our  crew, the master I suppose, a grizzled old fellow, who sits on his heels  on a scrap of plank out at our stern and steers. He takes four deep  inhalations and the mutual pipe is put away forward again. Our elderly  \"Boy\" is a Madrassee, tidy and clerk-like, and a contrast to the  pirates; and he does not understand them very well, but he pats the pipe  condescendingly as it is passed forward, and puts questions about it  with a condescending little smile.    [Illustration]    Elephanta comes closer and we see the undergrowth on the hills, and it  does not seem very unfamiliar; it is considerate the way in which Nature  leads you from one scene to another without any change sudden enough to  shock you; in the most out-of-the-way corners of the world I believe,  you may find features that remind you of places you have known. Here the  few palms on the sky-line of the low hills, almost accidental  features you might say, are all there is to distinguish the general  aspect from some loch side at home. Our Stroke points ashore and grins,  and says, \"Elephanta,\" and we say, \"Are you sure, is it not an island on  Loch Katrine?\" and he grins again and bobs and says, \"Yes, yes  Elephanta!\"    [Illustration: Sailing from Elephanta.]    I thought I'd written a remarkably expressive description of the  carvings in the caves; if I did I can't find it, so the reader is  spared. But I must say, before jogging on, that they are well worth  taking far greater trouble to see than the little trouble that is  required. I had heard them often spoken of lightly, but in my opinion  they are great works of a debased art. The sculptured groups would be  received any day _hors concours_ in the Salons for their technique only.  There are figures in grand repose, as solemn and dignified as the best  in early Egyptian sculpture, others show astonishing vigour, and  fantastic freedom of movement and of light and shade. They are cut in  the rock _in situ_, hard, blackish serpentine, which is a soft grey  colour on the exposed surfaces. In some parts the carving is as modern  in style and free in movement and composition as some _tourtmente_  modern French sculpture. But here, as in Europe and Egypt, marvellous  talent has been used in the name of religion to express imaginings of  the supernatural and inhuman, instead of being humbly devoted to the  study of the beauty presented in nature.    Going home we sailed into the sunset, and it certainly was pretty late  when we got back to dinner; in fact half of our little voyage was in the  dark, in heavy dew and with red and green lights passing"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2276"],[0,"The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner (#20)"],[1,"one lie always  paved the way for another, from hour to hour, from day to day, and from  year to year; so that I found myself constantly involved in a labyrinth  of deceit, from which it was impossible to extricate myself. If I knew  a person to be a godly one, I could almost have kissed his feet; but,  against the carnal portion of mankind, I set my face continually. I  esteemed the true ministers of the gospel; but the prelatic party, and  the preachers up of good works I abhorred, and to this hour I account  them the worst and most heinous of all transgressors.    There was only one boy at Mr. Witch's class who kept always the upper  hand of me in every part of education. I strove against him from year  to year, but it was all in vain; for he was a very wicked boy, and I  was convinced he had dealings with the Devil. Indeed, it was believed  all over the country that his mother was a witch; and I was at length  convinced, that it was no human ingenuity that beat me with so much  ease in the Latin, after I had often sat up a whole night with my  reverend father, studying my lesson in all its bearings. I often read  as well and sometimes better than he; but, the moment Mr. Wilson began  to examine us, my opponent popped up above me. I determined (as I knew  him for a wicked person, and one of the Devil's handfasted children) to  be revenged on him, and to humble him by some means or other.  Accordingly I lost no opportunity of setting the master against him,  and succeeded several times in getting him severely beaten for faults  of which he was innocent. I can hardly describe the joy that it gave to  my heart to see a wicked creature suffering, for, though he deserved it  not for one thing, he richly deserved it for others. This may be by  some people accounted a great sin in me; but I deny it, for I did it as  a duty, and what a man or boy does for the right will never be put into  the sum of his transgressions.    This boy, whose name was M'Gill, was, at all his leisure hours, engaged  in drawing profane pictures of beasts, men, women, houses, and trees,  and, in short, of all things that his eye encountered. These profane  things the master often smiled at, and admired; therefore I began  privately to try my hand likewise. I had scarcely tried above once to  draw the figure of a man, ere I conceived that I had hit the very  features of Mr. Wilson. They were so particular that they could not be  easily mistaken, and I was so tickled and pleased with the droll  likeness that I had drawn that I laughed immoderately at it. I tried no  other figure but this; and I tried it in every situation in which a man  and a schoolmaster could be placed. I often wrought for hours together  at this likeness, nor was it long before I made myself so much master  of the outline that I could have drawn it in any situation whatever,  almost off hand. I then took M'Gill's account book of algebra home with  me, and at my leisure put down a number of gross caricatures of Mr.  Wilson here and there, several of them in situations notoriously  ludicrous. I waited the discovery of this treasure with great  impatience; but the book, chancing to be one that M'Gill was not using,  I saw it might be long enough before I enjoyed the consummation of my  grand scheme: therefore, with all the ingenuity I was master of, I  brought it before our dominie's eye. But never shall I forget the rage  that gleamed in the tyrant's phiz! I was actually terrified to look at  him, and trembled at his voice. M'Gill was called upon, and examined  relating to the obnoxious figures. He denied flatly that any of them  were of his doing. But the master inquiring at him whose they were, he  could not tell, but affirmed it to be some trick. Mr. Wilson at one  time began, as I thought, to hesitate; but the evidence was so strong  against M'Gill that at length his solemn asseverations of innocence  only proved an aggravation of his crime. There was not one in the  school who had ever been known to draw a figure but himself, and on him  fell the whole weight of the tyrant's vengeance. It was dreadful; and I  was once in hopes that he would not leave life in the culprit. He,  however, left the school for several months, refusing to return to be  subjected to punishment for the faults of others, and I stood king of  the class.    Matters, were at last made up between M'Gill's parents and the  schoolmaster, but by that time I had got the start of him, and never in  my life did I exert myself so much as to keep the mastery. It was in  vain; the powers of enchantment prevailed, and I was again turned down  with the tear in my eye. I could think of no amends but one, and, being  driven to desperation, I put it in practice. I told a lie of him. I  came boldly up to the master, and told him that M'Gill had in my  hearing cursed him in a most shocking manner, and called him vile  names. He called M'Gill, and charged him with the crime, and the proud  young coxcomb was so stunned at the atrocity of the charge that his  face grew as red as crimson, and the words stuck in his throat as he  feebly denied it. His guilt was manifest, and he was again flogged most  nobly and dismissed the school for ever in disgrace, as a most  incorrigible vagabond.    This was a great victory gained, and I rejoiced and exulted exceedingly  in it. It had, however, very nigh cost me my life; for I not long  thereafter I encountered M'Gill in the fields, on which he came up and  challenged me for a liar, daring me to fight him. I refused, and said  that I looked on him as quite below my notice; but he would not quit  me, and finally told me that he should either lick me, or I should lick  him, as he had no other means of being revenged on such a scoundrel. I  tried to intimidate him, but it would not do; and I believe I would  have given all that I had in the world to be quit of him. He at length  went so far as first to kick me, and then strike me on the face; and,  being both older and stronger than he, I thought it scarcely became me  to take such insults patiently. I was, nevertheless, well aware that  the devilish powers of his mother would finally prevail; and either the  dread of this, or the inward consciousness of having wronged him,  certainly unnerved my arm, for I fought wretchedly, and was soon wholly  overcome. I was so sore defeated that I kneeled and was going to beg  his pardon; but another thought struck me momentarily, and I threw  myself on my face, and inwardly begged aid from heaven; at the same  time I felt as if assured that my prayer was heard, and would be  answered. While I was in this humble attitude, the villain kicked me  with his foot and cursed me; and I, being newly encouraged, arose and  encountered him once more. We had not fought long at this second turn  before I saw a man hastening towards us; on which I uttered a shout of  joy, and laid on valiantly; but my very next look assured me that the  man was old John Barnet, whom I had likewise wronged all that was in my  power, and between these two wicked persons I expected anything but  justice. My arm was again enfeebled, and that of my adversary  prevailed. I was knocked down and mauled most grievously, and, while  the ruffian was kicking and cuffing me at his will and pleasure, up  came old John Barnet, breathless with running, and, at one blow with  his open hand, levelled my opponent with the earth. \"Tak ye that,  maister!\" said John, \"to learn ye better breeding. Hout awa, man! An ye  will fight, fight fair. Gude sauf us, ir ye a gentleman's brood, that  ye will kick an' cuff a lad when he's down?\"    When I heard this kind and unexpected interference, I began once more  to value myself on my courage, and, springing up, I made at my  adversary; but John, without saying a word, bit his lip, and seizing me  by the neck threw me down. M'Gill begged of him to stand and see fair  play, and suffer us to finish the battle; for, added he, \"he is a liar,  and a scoundrel, and deserves ten times more than I can give him.\"    \"I ken he's a' that ye say, an' mair, my man,\" quoth John. \"But am I  sure that ye're no as bad, an' waur? It says nae muckle for ony o' ye  to be tearing like tikes at one anither here.\"    John cocked his cudgel and stood between us, threatening to knock the  one dead who first offered to lift his hand against the other; but,  perceiving no disposition in any of us to separate, he drove me home  before him like a bullock, and keeping close guard behind me, lest  M'Gill had followed. I felt greatly indebted to John, yet I complained  of his interference to my mother, and the old officious sinner got no  thanks for his pains.    As I am writing only from recollection, so I remember of nothing  farther in these early days, in the least worthy of being recorded.  That I was a great, a transcendent sinner, I confess. But still I had  hopes of forgiveness, because I never sinned from principle, but  accident; and then I always tried to repent of these sins by the slump,  for individually it was impossible; and, though not always successful  in my endeavours, I could not help that, the grace of repentance being  withheld from me, I regarded myself as in no degree accountable for the  failure. Moreover, there were many of the most deadly sins into which I  never fell, for I dreaded those mentioned in the Revelations as  excluding sins, so that I guarded against them continually. In  particular, I brought myself to despise, if not to abhor, the beauty of  women, looking on it as the greatest snare to which mankind was  subjected, and though young men and maidens, and even old women (my  mother among the rest), taxed me with being an unnatural wretch, I  gloried in my acquisition; and, to this day, am thankful for having  escaped the most dangerous of all snares.    I kept myself also free of the sins of idolatry and misbelief, both of  a deadly nature; and, upon the whole, I think I had not then broken, "]]]
