Moreover, the exact  composition of the minerals of which the great masses of rocks are  composed is liable to some variety. Those which we have taken as  illustrations have been selected as typical of the minerals; but it is  not uncommon to find albite containing 2 or 3 per cent of potash,  labradorite with a considerable proportion of soda, and zeolitic  minerals containing several per cent of potash, the presence of which  must of course considerably modify the properties of the soils produced  from them. They are also greatly affected by the mechanical influences  to which the rocks are exposed; and being situated for the most part in  elevated positions, they are no sooner disintegrated than they are  washed down by the rains. A granite, for instance, as the result of  disintegration, has its felspar reduced to an impalpable powder, while  its quartz and mica remain, the former entirely, the latter in great  part, in the crystalline grains which existed originally in the granite.  If such a disintegrated granite remains on the spot, it is easy to see  what its composition must be; but if exposed to the action of running  water, by which it is washed away from its original site, a process of  separation takes place, the heavy grains of quartz are first deposited,  then the lighter mica, and lastly the felspar. Thus there may be  produced from the same granite, soils of very different nature and  composition, from a pure and barren sand to a rich clay formed entirely  of felspathic debris.    The sedimentary or stratified rocks are formed of particles carried down  by water and deposited at the bottom of the primeval seas from which  they have been upheaved in the course of geological changes. The  process of their formation may be watched at the present day at the  mouths of all great rivers, where a delta composed of the suspended  matters carried down by the waters is slowly formed. The nature of these  rocks must therefore depend entirely on that of the country through  which the river flows. If its course runs through a country in which  lime is abundant, calcareous rocks will be deposited, and if it passes  through districts of different geological characters the deposit must  necessarily consist of a mixture of the disintegrated particles of the  different rocks the river has encountered. For this reason it is  impossible to enter upon a detailed account of their composition. It is  to be observed, however, that the particles of which they are composed,  though originally derived from the crystalline rocks, have generally  undergone a complex series of changes, geology teaching that, after  deposition, they may in their turn undergo disintegration and be carried  away by water, to be again deposited. Their composition must therefore  vary not merely according to the nature of the rock from which they have  been formed, but also according to the extent to which the decomposition  has gone, and the successive changes to which they have been exposed.  They may be reduced to the three great classes of clays, including the  different kinds of clay slates, shales, etc., sandstone and limestone.  It must be added also, that many of them contain carbonaceous matters  produced by the decomposition of early races of plants and animals, and  that mixtures of two or more of the different classes are frequent.    The purest clays are produced by the decomposition of felspar, but  almost all the crystalline rocks may produce them by the removal of  their alkalies, iron, lime, etc. Where circumstances have been  favourable, the whole of these substances are removed, and the clay  which remains consists almost entirely of silica and alumina, and yields  a soil which is almost barren, not merely on account of the deficiency  of many of the necessary elements of plants, but because it is so stiff  and impenetrable that the roots find their way into it with difficulty.  It rarely happens, however, that decomposition has advanced so far as to  remove the whole of the alkalies, which is exemplified by the following  analyses of the fire clay of the coal formation, and of transition clay  slate:--                      Transition   Fire Clay.

Such  sandstones yield soils of better quality, but they are always light and  poor. Where they occur interstratified with clays, still better soils  are produced, the mutual admixture of the disintegrated rocks affording  a substance of intermediate properties, in which the heaviness of the  clay is tempered by the lightness of the sandstone.    Limestone is one of the most widely distributed of the stratified rocks,  and in different localities occurs of very different composition.  Limestones are divided into two classes, common and magnesian; the  former a nearly pure carbonate of lime, the latter a mixture of that  substance with carbonate of magnesia. But while these are the principal  constituents, it is not uncommon to find small quantities of phosphate  and sulphate of lime, which, however trifling their proportions, are not  unimportant in an agricultural point of view. The following analyses  will serve to illustrate the general composition of these two sorts of  limestone as they occur in the early geological formations:--                              COMMON.

They are replaced in later geological periods by  others which are much softer, and often purer, of which the oolitic  limestones, so called from their resemblance to the roe of a fish, and  chalk are the most important. Other limestones are also known which  contain an admixture of clay. The soils produced by the disintegration  of limestone and chalk are generally light and porous, but when mixed  with clay, possess a very high degree of fertility, and this is  particularly the case with chalk, which yields some of the most valuable  of all soils. But it is true only of the common limestones, for  experience has shown that those which contain magnesia in large quantity  are often prejudicial to vegetation, and sometimes yield barren or  inferior soils.    Such are the general characters of the three great classes of stratified  rocks; any attempt to particularise the numerous varieties of each would  lead us far beyond the limits of the present work. It is necessary,  however, to remark, that in many instances one variety passes into the  other, or, more correctly speaking, sedimentary rocks occur, which are  mixtures of two or more of the three great classes. In fact, the name  given to each really expresses only the preponderating ingredient, and  many sandstones contain much clay, shales and clay slates abound in  lime, and limestones in sand or clay, so that it may sometimes be a  matter of some difficulty to decide to which class they belong. Such  mixtures usually produce better soils than either of their constituents  separately, and accordingly, in those geological formations in which  they occur, the soils are generally of excellent quality. The same  effect is produced where numerous thin beds of members of the different  classes are interstratified, the disintegrated portions being gradually  intermixed, and valuable soils formed.    The fertility of the soils formed from the stratified rocks is also  increased by the presence of organic remains which afford a supply of  phosphoric acid, and which are sometimes so abundant as to form a by no  means unimportant part of their mass. They do not occur in the oldest  sedimentary rocks, but as we ascend to the more recent geological  epochs, they increase in abundance, until, in the greensands and other  recent formations, whole beds of coprolites and other organic remains  are met with. Great differences are observed in the quality of the soils  yielded by different rocks. In general, those formed by the  disintegration of clay slates are cold, heavy, and very difficult and  expensive to work; those of sandstone light and poor, and of limestone  often poor and thin. These statements must, however, be considered as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24951"],[0,"The War in South Africa, Its Cause and Conduct (#20)"],[1,"period, and the men were so reduced in strength that  their military efficiency was much impaired. Yet they lived in a land of  plenty--a land of large farms well stocked with every sort of food. Why  it was impossible to get this food for the men I do not know, but I do  know that the prices for bread, eggs, milk, and other such things were  kept very high by the wives of the farmers who were away upon commando;  and that the hungry soldiers were quite unable to buy, and were not  permitted to take, the nourishment which was essential.    On May 19, while Lord Roberts's force was advancing on Pretoria, De Wet  sent in a despatch to complain of the destruction of two farms, Paarde  Kraal and Leeuw Kop. Lord Roberts replied that these two farms were  destroyed because, while a white flag was flying from the houses, the  troops were fired upon from the farmsteads. 'I have had two farms near  Kroonstad,' he adds, 'destroyed for similar reasons, and shall continue  to punish all such cases of treachery by the destruction of the farms  where they occur.' Here is a definite declaration of policy, quite  distinct from wanton destruction, and it is difficult to see how any  General could take any other steps, with justice to his own men. These  farms, and all which are included in this category, were justly and  properly destroyed--the families being removed without violence to a  place of safety.    The next representations from the Boer Commander were more definite in  their nature.    'Complaints are repeatedly reaching me,' he writes, 'that private  dwellings are plundered, and in some cases totally destroyed, and all  provisions taken from women and children, so that they are compelled to  wander about without food or covering. To quote several instances: It  has just been brought to my notice by way of sworn affidavit that the  house of Field-Cornet S. Buys on the farm, Leeuwspruit district,  Middelburg, was set on fire and destroyed on 20th June last. His wife,  who was at home, was given five minutes' time to remove her bedding and  clothing, and even what she took out was again taken from her. Her food,  sugar, &c., was all taken, so that for herself and her children she had  neither covering nor food for the following night. She was asked for the  key of the safe, and after it was given up by her she was threatened  with a sword, and money was demanded. All the money that was in the  house was taken away, all the papers in the safe were torn up, and  everything at the homestead that could not be taken away was destroyed.  The house of Field-Cornet Buys's son was also destroyed, the doors and  windows broken, &c.    'It has also been reported to me that my own buildings, on the farm  Varkenspruit, district Standerton, as well as the house of Field-Cornet  Badenhorst, on the adjoining farm, have been totally destroyed, and such  of the stock as was not removed was shot dead on the farm.    'Further, there is the sworn declaration of Mrs. Hendrik Badenhorst,  which speaks for itself.    'I cannot believe that such godless barbarities take place with Your  Excellency's consent, and thus I deem it my solemn duty to protest most  strongly against such destruction and vindictiveness as being entirely  contrary to civilised warfare.'    The greater part of these alleged outrages had occurred on General  Buller's side of the Transvaal, so the matter was referred to him. He  acknowledged that he had ordered six farmhouses to be destroyed:    'The following circumstances induced me to give the order. On entering  the Transvaal I caused the attached Proclamation (A) to be widely  distributed along my line of route. We marched from Volksrust to  Standerton practically unopposed. Shortly after our arrival at  Standerton our telegraph line was cut on several nights following, and  attempts were made to damage the military line by placing dynamite  cartridges with detonators attached upon it. These attempts were all  made on or in close vicinity to the estates above named. A watch was  kept and it was found that the attempts were made not by any formed  force of the enemy, but by a few scattered banditti who were given  shelter during the night in the houses I afterwards had destroyed, and  who thence, when they could, tried to murder our patrols, and sallied  out at night to damage the line. It was further ascertained that these  men came and usually returned through Varkenspruit. I directed that  copies of Proclamation (A) should be personally left at each house, and  the inmates of each should be warned that these depredations could not  be permitted, and that if people living under our protection allowed  these sort of men to resort to their houses without informing us, they  must take the consequences, and their houses would be destroyed. This  warning had some effect for a day or two, but on 1st and 2nd of July the  nuisance recommenced, and on the 7th July, having acquired full proof  that the houses were being regularly used as shelters for men who were  hostile to us, and who were not under any proper command, in fact, who  were only acting as banditti, I had the houses destroyed.    'The women and children occupying the farms were removed elsewhere with  as little inconvenience to themselves as we could arrange.'    Here again it is impossible to doubt that the British commanders were  well within their rights. It is true that Article XXIII. of The Hague  Conventions makes it illegal to destroy the enemy's property, but it  adds: 'Unless such destruction be imperatively demanded by the  necessities of war.' Now nothing can be more imperative in war than the  preservation of the communications of the army. A previous clause of the  same Article makes it illegal to 'kill or wound treacherously  individuals belonging to the hostile army.' It is incontestable that to  take the cover of a farmhouse which flies the white flag in order to  make attacks is to 'kill or wound treacherously,' and so on a double  count the action of the British becomes legal, and even inevitable. Lord  Roberts's message to De Wet upon August 3, 1900, restates both his  intentions and his reasons for it:    'Latterly, many of my soldiers have been shot from farmhouses over which  the white flag has been flying, the railway and telegraph lines have  been cut, and trains wrecked. I have therefore found it necessary, after  warning your Honour, to take such steps as are sanctioned by the customs  of war to put an end to these and similar acts, and have burned down the  farmhouses at or near which such deeds have been perpetrated. This I  shall continue to do whenever I consider the occasion demands it.    'The remedy lies in your Honour's own hands. The destruction of property  is most distasteful to me, and I shall be greatly pleased when your  Honour's co-operation in the matter renders it no longer necessary.'    This raises the question of the legality of the burning of farmhouses in  the vicinity of the place where the railway is cut. The question  presented itself forcibly to my mind when I saw with my own eyes the  tall plumes of smoke rising from six farmhouses, De Wet's among them, in  the neighbourhood of Roodeval. There is no doubt whatever that in the  war of 1870--the classic type of modern war--the villages and  populations near the scene of a cut railway were severely punished. But  The Hague Conventions had not then been signed. On the one hand, it may  be urged that it is impossible without such disciplinary measures to  preserve a line of 1,000 miles running all the way through a hostile or  semi-hostile country. Also that it is 'imperatively demanded by the  necessities of war.' On the other hand, there is Article L., which says,  'No general penalty can be inflicted on the population on account of the  acts of individuals, for which it cannot be regarded as collectively  responsible.' An argument might be advanced for either side, but what  will actually determine is the strongest argument of all--that of  self-preservation. An army situated as the British Army was, and  dependent for its supplies upon its communications, _must_ keep them  open even if it strains the Conventions in doing so. As a matter of  fact, farm-burning had no effect in checking the railway-cutting, and  had a considerable effect in embittering the population. Yet a General  who was cut off from his base thirty times in a month was bound to leave  the argument of legality to the jurists, and to adopt the means which  seemed most likely to stop the nuisance. The punishment fell with cruel  injustice upon some individuals. Others may have been among the actual  raiders.    On September 2 Lord Roberts communicated his intentions to General  Botha:    'SIR,--I have the honour to address your Honour regarding the operations  of those comparatively small bands of armed Boers who conceal themselves  on farms in the neighbourhood of our lines of communication and thence  endeavour to damage the railway, thus endangering the lives of  passengers travelling by train who may or may not be combatants.    '2. My reason for again referring to this subject is that, except in the  districts occupied by the Army under the personal command of your  Honour, there is now no formed body of Boer troops in the Transvaal or  Orange River Colony, and that the war is degenerating into operations  carried on by irregular and irresponsible guerillas. This would be so  ruinous to the country and so deplorable from every point of view, that  I feel bound to do everything in my power to prevent it.    '3. The orders I have at present issued, to give effect to these views,  are that the farm nearest the scene of any attempt to injure the line or  wreck a train is to be burnt, and that all farms within a radius of 10  miles are to be completely cleared of all their stock, supplies, &c.'    Granting that the penalty is legal at all, it must be allowed that it is  put in a"]]]
