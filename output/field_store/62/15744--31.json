People are generally in too great haste when furnishing. They should be  prudent, deliberate, and wait with their eyes open until they see the  sort of things that will suit them. They should buy the most instantly  necessary articles first with ready money, and add to these as they can  afford it to carry out ideas formed by observation. They should buy what  can be easily replaced after legitimate wear and tear, what their  servants can properly attend to, and what will save labour and time.          CHAPTER XIII.    MARRIED PEOPLE'S MONEY.      \"Never treat money affairs with levity--money is character.\"--_Sir E.                                                           Bulwer Lytton._      A Scotch minister, preaching against the love of money, had frequently  repeated that it was \"the root of all evil.\" Walking home from the  church one old person said to another, \"An wasna the minister strang  upon the money?\" \"Nae doubt,\" said the other, and added, \"Ay, but it's  grand to hae the wee bit siller in your hand when ye gang an errand.\" So  too, in spite of all that love-in-a-cottage theorists may say, \"it's  grand to hae the wee bit siller\" when marrying; unless, indeed, we  believe that mortality is one of the effects of matrimony as did the  girl, who, on meeting a lady whose service she had lately left, and  being asked, \"Well, Mary, where do you live now?\" answered, \"Please,  ma'am, I don't live now--I'm married.\" To marry for love and work for  silver is quite right, but there should be a reasonable chance of  getting work to do and some provision for a rainy day. It is only the  stupidity which is without anxiety, that complacently marries on  \"nothing a week; and that uncertain--very!\" And yet such flying in the  face of Providence is often spoken of as being disinterested and heroic,  and the quiverfuls of children resulting from it are supposed to be  blessed. As if it were a blessing to give children appetites of hunger  and thirst, and nothing to satisfy them.    On the other hand, there is some truth in the saying that \"what will  keep one will keep two.\" There are bachelors who are so ultra-prudent,  and who hold such absurd opinions as to the expense of matrimony that,  although they have enough money they have not enough courage to enter  the state. Pitt used to say that he could not afford to marry, yet his  butcher's bill was so enormous that some one has calculated it as  affording his servants about fourteen pounds of meat a day, each man and  woman! For the more economical regulation of his household, if for no  other reason, he should have taken to himself a wife.    Newly-married people should be careful not to pitch their rate of  expenditure higher than they can hope to continue it; and they should  remember that, as Lord Bacon said, \"it is less dishonourable to abridge  petty charges (expenses) than to stoop to petty gettings.\" That was  excellent advice which Dr. Johnson gave to Boswell when the latter  inherited his paternal estate: \"You, dear sir, have now a new station,  and have, therefore, new cares and new employments. Life, as Cowley  seems to say, ought to resemble a well-ordered poem; of which one rule  generally received is, that the exordium should be simple, and should  promise little. Begin your new course of life with the least show, and  the least expense possible; you may at pleasure increase both, but you  cannot easily diminish them. Do not think your estate your own, while  any man can call upon you for money which you cannot pay; therefore  begin with timorous parsimony. Let it be your first care not to be in  any man's debt.\"    The thrifty wife of Benjamin Franklin felt it a gala day indeed when, by  long accumulated small savings, she was able to surprise her husband one  morning with a china cup and a silver spoon, from which to take his  breakfast. Franklin was shocked: \"You see how luxury creeps into  families in spite of principles,\" he said. When his meal was over he  went to the store, and rolled home a wheelbarrow full of papers through  the streets with his own hands, lest folks should get wind of the china  cup, and say he was above his business.    Although the creeping in of luxury is to be guarded against at the  commencement of married life, people should learn to grow rich  gracefully. It is no part of wisdom to depreciate the little elegances  and social enjoyments of our homes. Those who can afford it act wisely  when they furnish their houses with handsome furniture, cover the walls  with suggestive paintings, and collect expensive books, for these things  afford refined enjoyment. One day a gentleman told Dr. Johnson that he  had bought a suit of lace for his wife. _Johnson_: \"Well, sir, you have  done a good thing, and a wise thing.\" \"I have done a good thing,\" said  the gentleman, \"but I do not know that I have done a wise thing.\"  _Johnson_: \"Yes, sir, no money is better spent than what is laid out for  domestic satisfaction. A man is pleased that his wife is dressed as  well as other people; and a wife is pleased that she is dressed.\"    We should be particular about money matters, but not penurious. The  penny soul never, it is said, came to twopence. There is that  withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty. People are  often saving at the wrong place, and spoil the ship for a halfpenny  worth of tar. They spare at the spigot, and let all run away at the  bunghole.    She is the wise wife who can steer between penuriousness and such  recklessness as is described in the following cutting from an American  periodical. \"My dear fellow,\" said Lavender, \"it's all very nice to talk  about economizing and keeping a rigid account of expenses, and that sort  of thing, but I've tried it. Two weeks ago I stepped in on my way home  Saturday night, and I bought just the gayest little Russian leather,  cream-laid account-book you ever saw, and a silver pencil to match it. I  said to my wife after supper: 'My dear, it seems to me it costs a lot of  money to keep house.' She sighed and said: 'I know it does, Lavvy; but  I'm sure I can't help it. I'm just as economical as I can be. I don't  spend half as much for candy as you do for cigars.' I never take any  notice of personalities, so I sailed right ahead. 'I believe, my dear,  that if we were to keep a strict account of everything we spend we could  tell just where to cut down. I've bought you a little account-book, and  every Monday morning I'll give you some money, and you can set it down  on one side; and then, during the week, you can set down on the other  side everything you spend. And then on Saturday night we can go over it  and see just where the money goes, and how we can boil things down a  little.' Well, sir, she was just delighted--thought it was a first-rate  plan, and the pocket account-book was lovely--regular David Copperfield  and Dora business. Well, sir, the next Saturday night we got through  supper, and she brought out that account-book as proud as possible, and  handed it over for inspection. On one side was, 'Received from Lavvy, 50  dols.' That's all right! Then I looked on the other page, and what do  you think was there? '_Spent it all!_' Then I laughed, and of course she  cried; and we gave up the account-book racket on the spot by mutual  consent. Yes, sir, I've been there, and I know what domestic economy  means, I tell you. Let's have a cigar.\"    It is the fear of this sort of thing, and especially of extravagance in  reference to dress, that confirms many men in bachelorship. A society  paper tells us that at a recent dance given at the West-end, a married  lady of extravagant habits impertinently asked a wealthy old bachelor if  he remained single because he could not afford to keep a wife. \"My  innocent young friend,\" was the reply, \"I could afford to keep three;  but I'm not rich enough to pay the milliner's bills of one.\"    A wife who puts conscience into the management of her husband's money  should not be obliged to account to him for the exact manner in which  she lays out each penny in the pound. An undue interference on his part  will cause much domestic irritation, and may have a bad influence on  social morals.    In \"Memoirs of the Life of Colonel Hutchinson,\" his wife says, \"So  liberal was he to her, and of so generous a temper, that he hated the  mention of severed purses; his estate being so much at her disposal  that he never would receive an account of anything she expended.\"    No one can feel dignified, free, and happy without the control of a  certain amount of money for the graces, the elegant adornments, and,  above all, for the charities of life. The hard-drawn line of simply  paying the bills closes a thousand avenues to gentle joys and pleasures  in a woman's daily life.    We would advise all wives to strike the iron when hot, so to speak, by  getting their husbands, before the ardour of the honeymoon cools, to  give them an annual allowance. The little unavoidable demands on a  husband's purse, to which a wife is so frequently compelled to have  recourse, are very apt to create bickering and discord; and when once  good-humour is put out of the way, it is not such an easy matter to  bring it back again.    A Chicago young lady, on being asked the usual question in which the  words \"love, honour, and obey\" occur, made the straightforward reply:  \"Yes, I will, if he does what he promises me financially.\" The conduct  of some husbands almost justified this answer.    As regards the important subject of Life Insurance there are few  husbands and fathers who can afford to be indifferent to the possibility  of making adequate and immediate provision for those dependent upon  them, in case of their sudden removal.    This matter of Life Insurance should be settled before marriage, as well  as all other monetary and legal arrangements that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35545"],[0,"Sanders of the River (#20)"],[1,"forth, and along it came, very dapper and white, his  little ebony stick with the silver knob swinging between his fingers,  Mr. Commissioner Sanders, very much alive, and there were two bright  Maxim-guns on either side of the gangway that covered the beach.    A nation, paralysed by fear and apprehension, watched the  _debarquement_, the chief of the Akasava being a little in advance of  his painted warriors.    On Sanders' face was a look of innocent surprise. \"Chief,\" said he, \"you  do me great honour that you gather your young men to welcome me;  nevertheless, I would rather see them working in their gardens.\"    He walked along one row of fighting men, plentifully besmeared with  cam-wood, and his was the leisurely step of some great personage  inspecting a guard of honour.    \"I perceive,\" he went on, talking over his shoulder to the chief who,  fascinated by the unexpected vision, followed him, \"I perceive that each  man has a killing spear, also a fighting shield of wicker work, and many  have N'Gombi swords.\"    \"Lord, it is true,\" said the chief, recovering his wits, \"for we go  hunting elephant in the Great Forest.\"    \"Also that some have the little bones of men fastened about their  necks--that is not for the elephant.\"    He said this meditatively, musingly, as he continued his inspection, and  the chief was frankly embarrassed.    \"There is a rumour,\" he stammered, \"it is said--there came a spy who  told us--that the Ochori were gathering for war, and we were afraid----\"    \"Strange,\" said Sanders, half to himself, but speaking in the  vernacular, \"strange indeed is this story, for I have come straight from  the Ochori city, and there I saw nothing but men who ground corn and  hunted peacefully; also their chief is ill, suffering from a fever.\"    He shook his head in well-simulated bewilderment.    \"Lord,\" said the poor chief of the Akasava, \"perhaps men have told us  lies--such things have happened----\"    \"That is true,\" said Sanders gravely. \"This is a country of lies; some  say that I am dead; and, lo! the news has gone around that there is no  law in the land, and men may kill and war at their good pleasure.\"    \"Though I die at this minute,\" said the chief virtuously, \"though the  river turn to fire and consume my inmost stomach, though every tree  become a tiger to devour me, I have not dreamt of war.\"    Sanders grinned internally.    \"Spare your breath,\" he said gently. \"You who go hunting elephants, for  it is a long journey to the Great Forest, and there are many swamps to  be crossed, many rivers to be swum. My heart is glad that I have come in  time to bid you farewell.\"    There was a most impressive silence, for this killing of elephants was a  stray excuse of the chief's. The Great Forest is a journey of two  months, one to get there and one to return, and is moreover through the  most cursed country, and the Akasava are not a people that love long  journeys save with the current of the river.    The silence was broken by the chief.    \"Lord, we desire to put off our journey in your honour, for if we go,  how shall we gather in palaver?\"    Sanders shook his head.    \"Let no man stop the hunter,\" quoth he. \"Go in peace, chief, and you  shall secure many teeth.\"[3] He saw a sudden light come to the chief's  eyes, but continued, \"I will send with you a sergeant of Houssas, that  he may carry back to me the story of your prowess\"--the light died away  again--\"for there will be many liars who will say that you never reached  the Great Forest, and I shall have evidence to confound them.\"    Still the chief hesitated, and the waiting ranks listened, eagerly  shuffling forward, till they ceased to bear any semblance to an ordered  army, and were as a mob.    \"Lord,\" said the chief, \"we will go to-morrow----\"    The smile was still on Sanders' lips, but his face was set, and his eyes  held a steely glitter that the chief of the Akasava knew.    \"You go to-day, my man,\" said Sanders, lowering his voice till he spoke  in little more than a whisper, \"else your warriors march under a new  chief, and you swing on a tree.\"    \"Lord, we go,\" said the man huskily, \"though we are bad marchers and our  feet are very tender.\"    Sanders, remembering the weariness of the Akasava, found his face  twitching.    \"With sore feet you may rest,\" he said significantly; \"with sore backs  you can neither march nor rest--go!\"    At dawn the next morning the N'Gombi people came in twenty-five war  canoes to join their Akasava friends, and found the village tenanted by  women and old men, and Tigili, the king, in the shock of the discovery,  surrendered quietly to the little party of Houssas on the beach.    \"What comes to me, lord?\" asked Tigili, the king.    Sanders whistled thoughtfully.    \"I have some instructions about you somewhere,\" he said.    [Footnote 3: Tusks.]            CHAPTER IX.      THE WOOD OF DEVILS.      Four days out of M'Sakidanga, if native report be true, there is a  trickling stream that meanders down from N'Gombi country. Native report  says that this is navigable even in the dry season.    The missionaries at Bonginda ridicule this report; and Arburt, the young  chief of the station, with a gentle laugh in his blue eyes, listened one  day to the report of Elebi about a fabulous land at the end of this  river, and was kindly incredulous.    \"If it be that ivory is stored in this place,\" he said in the  vernacular, \"or great wealth lies for the lifting, go to Sandi, for this  ivory belongs to the Government. But do you, Elebi, fix your heart more  upon God's treasures in heaven, and your thoughts upon your unworthiness  to merit a place in His kingdom, and let the ivory go.\"    Elebi was known to Sanders as a native evangelist of the tornado type, a  thunderous, voluble sub-minister of the service; he had, in his ecstatic  moments, made many converts. But there were days of reaction, when Elebi  sulked in his mud hut, and reviewed Christianity calmly.    It was a service, this new religion. You could not work yourself to a  frenzy in it, and then have done with the thing for a week. You must  needs go on, on, never tiring, never departing from the straight path,  exercising irksome self-restraint, leaving undone that which you would  rather do.    \"Religion is prison,\" grumbled Elebi, after his interview, and shrugged  his broad, black shoulders.    In his hut he was in the habit of discarding his European coat for the  loin cloth and the blanket, for Elebi was a savage--an imitative  savage--but still barbarian. Once, preaching on the River of Devils, he  had worked himself up to such a pitch of enthusiastic fervour that he  had smitten a scoffer, breaking his arm, and an outraged Sanders had him  arrested, whipped, and fined a thousand rods. Hereafter Elebi had  figured in certain English missionary circles as a Christian martyr, for  he had lied magnificently, and his punishment had been represented as a  form of savage persecution.    But the ivory lay buried three days' march beyond the Secret River; thus  Elebi brooded over the log that smouldered in his hut day and night.  Three days beyond the river, branching off at a place where there were  two graves, the country was reputably full of devils, and Elebi  shuddered at the thought; but, being a missionary and a lay evangelist,  and, moreover, the proud possessor of a copy of the Epistle to the  Romans (laboriously rendered into the native tongue), he had little to  fear. He had more to fear from a certain White Devil at a far-away  headquarters, who might be expected to range the lands of the Secret  River, when the rains had come and gone.    It was supposed that Elebi had one wife, conforming to the custom of the  white man, but the girl who came into the hut with a steaming bowl of  fish in her hands was not the wife that the missionaries recognised as  such.    \"Sikini,\" he said, \"I am going a journey by canoe.\"    \"In the blessed service?\" asked Sikini, who had come under the influence  of the man in his more elated periods.    \"The crackling of a fire is like a woman's tongue,\" quoted Elebi; \"and  it is easier to keep the lid on a boiling pot than a secret in a woman's  heart.\"    Elebi had the river proverbs at his finger-tips, and the girl laughed,  for she was his favourite wife, and knew that in course of time the  information would come to her.    \"Sikini,\" said the man suddenly, \"you know that I have kept you when the  Blood Taker would have me put you away.\"    (Arburt had a microscope and spent his evenings searching the blood of  his flock for signs of trynosomiasis.)    \"You know that for your sake I lied to him who is my father and my  protector, saying: 'There shall be but one wife in my house, and that  Tombolo, the coast woman.'\"    The girl nodded, eyeing him stolidly.    \"Therefore I tell you that I am going beyond the Secret River, three  days' march, leaving the canoe at a place where there are two graves.\"    \"What do you seek?\" she asked.    \"There are many teeth in that country,\" he said; \"dead ivory that the  people brought with them from a distant country, and have hidden,  fearing one who is a Breaker of Stones.[4] I shall come back rich, and  buy many wives who shall wait upon you and serve you, and then I will no  longer be Christian, but will worship the red fetish as my father did,  and his father.\"    \"Go,\" she said, nodding thoughtfully.    He told her many things that he had not revealed to Arburt--of how the  ivory came, of the people who guarded it, of the means by which he  intended to secure it.    Next morning before the mission _lo-koli_ sounded, he had slipped away  in his canoe; and Arburt, when the news came to him, sighed and called  him a disappointing beggar--for Arburt was human. Sanders, who was also  human, sent swift messengers to arrest Elebi, for it is not a good thing  that treasure-hunting natives should go wandering through a strange  country, such"]]]
