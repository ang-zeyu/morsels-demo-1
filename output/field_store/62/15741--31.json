The Corinthian expresses the  utmost lightness, by forming its capitals of foliage, as if the weight  above them could not crush even a leaf. The Composite expresses gayety, by  adding flowers to the foliage. It is from imperfect views of this, that  the meaning and effect of caryatides have been mistaken: instead of being  oppressed by weight, they seem, when well employed, to have no weight to  support.    In nearly all internal architectural decorations, it is the delicate,  bending, varied, and contrasted vegetable forms which are imitated.    \"There is scarce a room, in any house whatever,\" says Hogarth, \"where one  does not see the waving line employed in some way or other. How inelegant  would the shapes of all our moveables be without it? how very plain and  unornamental the mouldings of cornices and chimney-pieces, without the  variety introduced by the ogee member, which is entirely composed of  waving lines.\"    The distinctions I have here made, are farther illustrated by the remarks  of Alison, who says: \"These ornaments being executed in a very hard and  durable substance, are in fact only beautiful when they appear but as  minute parts of the whole. The great constituent parts of every building  require direct and angular lines, because in such parts we require the  expression of stability and strength. It is only in the minute and  delicate parts of the work, that any kind of ornament is attempted with  propriety; and whenever ornaments exceed in size, in their quantity of  matter, or in the prominence of their relief, that proportion which, in  point of lightness or delicacy, we expect them to hold with respect to the  whole of the building, the imitation of the most beautiful vegetable forms  does not preserve them from the censure of clumsiness and deformity.\"    In dress, considered as an ornamental art, and, as practised by the sex  which chiefly studies it, the chief beauty depends on the adoption of  winding forms in drapery, and of wreaths of flowers for the head, &c.  These are essential to the variety and contrast, as well as to the gayety  which that sex desires.    \"Uniformity,\" says Hogarth, \"is chiefly complied with in dress, on account  of fitness, and seems to be extended not much farther than dressing both  arms alike, and having the shoes of the same color. For when any part of  dress has not the excuse of fitness or propriety for its uniformity of  parts, the ladies always call it formal.\"    These irregular, varying, and somewhat complicated draperies excite that  active curiosity, and those movements of imagination, to which skilful  women never neglect to address themselves in modern costume.    It is with the same feeling and intention, whether these be defined or  not, that, in the head-dress, they seek for bending lines and  circumvolutions, and that they combine variously the waves and the tresses  of the hair.    For the same reason, a feather or a flower is never placed precisely over  the middle of the forehead; and if two are employed, great care is taken  that their positions are dissimilar.    It has sometimes struck me as remarkable, that precious stones are almost  always arranged differently from flowers. While the latter are placed  irregularly, and in waving lines, not only on the head, but the bosom, and  the skirt of the dress, the former are in general regularly placed, either  on the median line of the person, as the middle of the forehead and, in  Eastern countries, of the nose, or symmetrically in similar pendants from  each ear, and bracelets on the arms and wrists.    The instinctive feeling which gives origin to this is, that flowers adorn  the system of life and reproduction, and by their color and smell,  associate with its emotions, which they also express and communicate to  others--they, therefore, assume the varied forms of that system; whereas,  diamonds, attached generally to mental organs, or organs of sense, are  significant of mental feelings, love of splendor, distinction, pride,  &c.--they, therefore, assume the symmetrical form of these organs. Hence,  too, flowers are recommended to the young; diamonds are permitted only to  the old.      _Beauty of Intellectual Objects._    I have already said, that the intellectual arts are, in their highest  efforts, characterized chiefly by animal forms, as in gesture, sculpture,  and painting, or by animal functions actually exercised, in oratory,  poetry, and music.    In the useful arts, the purpose is utility; in the ornamental arts, it is  bodily or sensual pleasure; and in the intellectual arts, it is the  pleasure of imagination.    The first elements of beauty, however, are not forgotten in these arts. As  simplicity is conspicuous in the works of nature, so is it a condition of  beauty in all the operations of mind. In philosophy, general theorems  become beautiful from this simplicity; and polished manners receive from  it dignity and grace. The intellectual arts are especially dependant upon  it: it has been a striking character of their most illustrious  cultivators, and of their very highest efforts.    How much the characters and accidents of elementary beauty influence  intellectual art, has been well shown by Mr. Knight.    \"In the higher class of landscapes,\" he says, \"whether in nature or in  art, the mere sensual gratification of the eye is comparatively so small,  as scarcely to be attended to: but yet, if there occur a single spot,  either in the scene or the picture, offensively harsh and glaring--if the  landscape-gardener, in the one, or the picture-cleaner, in the other, have  exerted their unhappy talents of polishing, all the magic instantly  vanishes, and the imagination avenges the injury offered to the sense. The  glaring and unharmonious spot, being the most prominent and obtrusive,  irresistibly attracts the attention, so as to interrupt the repose of the  whole, and leaves the mind no place to rest upon.\"    \"It is, in some respects,\" he observes, \"the same with the sense of  hearing. The mere sensual gratification, arising from the melody of an  actor's voice, is a very small part, indeed, of the pleasure which we  receive from the representation of a fine drama: but, nevertheless, if a  single note of the voice be absolutely cracked and out of tune, so as to  offend and disgust the ear, it will completely destroy the effect of the  most skilful acting, and render all the sublimity and pathos of the finest  tragedy ludicrous.\"    This, I may observe, is a concession of much that he elsewhere  inconsistently contends for; for sensual beauty could never act thus  powerfully, if it possessed not fundamental importance as an element even  in the most complex beauty.    That the second kind of beauty also enters into the acts or products of  intellectual beauty, is sufficiently illustrated by the observation of  Hogarth, who on this subject observes, that all the common and necessary  motions for the business of life are performed by men in straight or plain  lines, while all the graceful and ornamental movements are made in waving  lines.    As Alison has given the best view of the history and character of beauty  in the intellectual arts, as that indeed constitutes the most valuable  portion of his work, I shall conclude this section by a greatly abridged  view of these as nearly as possible in his own words.    There is no production of taste, which has not many qualities of a very  indifferent kind; and our sense of the beauty or sublimity of every object  accordingly depends upon the quality or qualities of it which we consider.    This, Mr. Alison might have observed, is in great measure dependant upon  our will. We can generally, when we please, confine our consideration of  it to the qualities that least excite pleasurable or painful emotion, and  that can least interest the imagination.    It is in consequence of this, that the exercise of criticism always  destroys, for the time, our sensibility to the beauty of every  composition, and that habits of this kind generally destroy the  sensibility of taste.    When, on the other hand, the emotions of sublimity or beauty are produced,  it will be found that some affection is uniformly first excited by the  presence of the object; and whether the general impression we receive is  that of gayety, or tenderness, or melancholy, or solemnity, or terror,  &c., we have never any difficulty of determining.    But whatever may be the nature of that simple emotion which any object is  fitted to excite, if it produce not a train of kindred thought in our  minds, we are conscious only of that simple emotion.    In many cases, on the contrary, we are conscious of a train of thought  being immediately awakened in the imagination, analogous to the character  of expression of the original object.    \"Thus, when we feel either the beauty or sublimity of natural scenery--the  gay lustre of a morning in spring, or the mild radiance of a  summer-evening--the savage majesty of a wintry storm, or the wild  magnificence of the tempestuous ocean--we are conscious of a variety of  images in our minds, very different from those which the objects  themselves present to the eye. Trains of pleasing or of solemn thought  arise spontaneously within our minds; our hearts swell with emotions, of  which the objects before us seem to afford no adequate cause; and we are  never so much satiated with delight, as when, in recalling our attention,  we are unable (little able, perhaps, and less disposed) to trace either  the progress or the connexion of those thoughts, which have passed with so  much rapidity through our imagination.    \"The effect of the different arts of taste is similar. The landscapes of  Claude Lorraine, the poetry of Milton, the music of the greatest masters,  excite feeble emotions in our minds when our attention is confined to the  qualities they present to our senses, or when it is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35448"],[0,"Herd Record of the Association of Breeders of Thorough-Bred Neat Stock (#20)"],[1," breeders of Ayrshire, in Scotland, have followed these  principles to some extent, if not to the full degree to which they  should be observed. Hence, they claim a high rank for the breed in  reference to general usefulness. Aiton, speaking of what the Ayrshire  cow would do, says, \"She yields much milk, and that of an oily or  butyraceous, or caseous nature, and after she has yielded very large  quantities of milk for several years, she shall be as valuable for beef  as any other breed of cows known; her fat shall be much more mixed  through the whole flesh, and she shall fatten faster than any other.\"  Whatever may be said in regard to the extent of these claims, it will be  admitted that they indicate the confidence which was long ago placed in  the breed in regard to the properties mentioned. Youatt, who wrote  twenty-five years after Aiton, says, \"The breed has been much improved  since Mr. Aiton described it.\" It is thirty years since Mr. Youatt made  this remark, and in this time the breed has been still further improved  in reference to general usefulness. I have been assured by some of the  most experienced breeders in Scotland, that while nothing has been lost  on the score of dairy properties, considerable has been gained in  hardiness and thrift, and in the faculty of giving a greater return,  both in milk and flesh, for the food consumed. Of course it is the  return obtained in proportion to the food eaten, that constitutes the  true criterion of value in all animals.    In Scotland, the calves of the Ayrshire breed, that are not wanted for  keeping up the breeding or dairy stock, are either fattened for veal, or  turned for beef at an early age. The larger portion, perhaps, of the  males are killed for veal. In fact, in some districts, veal is an  article of considerable importance, and the ability of Ayrshire cows to  make fat calves is considered one of the excellencies of the breed. Thus  Haxton observes, \"For all medium soils and climates throughout the  United Kingdom, there is no breed equal to the Ayrshire, for profit,  whether the produce is converted into cheese, butter, or _veal_.\" A  portion of the males are castrated and fattened when about three to  three and half years old. Scotch farmers, who are in the practice of  fattening stock of various breeds, assured me that Ayrshire steers of  this age fattened to as much profit as any, reaching the weight of 700  to 800 pounds the four quarters, and afforded beef excelled in quality  only by the Galloways and the West-Highlanders.    At present the Ayrshire cattle have not been tried in America to a great  extent. There have been various importations, mostly made within the  last twenty years, and so far as there have been such trials as would  justify a conclusion in regard to their merits, they have answered all  reasonable expectations. The leading object in keeping them here is the  same as it is in Scotland--the dairy--but their ability to fatten  readily and make beef of good quality, should be taken into  consideration in estimating their value. In regard to the latter  property, but few trials have as yet been made here. Most of the males  have been kept for bulls, and the females have seldom been fattened till  too far advanced in years to breed. It may be worthy of consideration,  whether it would not be an object to give some good steers of the breed  a fair chance to show what they could make in beef at three to four  years old.    It is also desirable to ascertain what are the capabilities of the breed  in regard to the performance of labor. On this point we are without any  evidence from abroad, as oxen are not worked in Scotland. The results of  the few trials that have been made with full-bloods, have been highly  favorable in reference to the qualities of the breed for this purpose.  Judging by their points, there is no reason why Ayrshire oxen should not  be equal to any others, of their size, for any kind of labor. They have  clean, firm legs, well-placed muscles, and are remarkably quick walkers.    The advantages of a Registry, or Herd Book, for this breed of cattle,  are too obvious to require argument. For the Short Horns, Herefords, and  Devons, registers have been prepared, and the benefits which have been  derived therefrom are such as will insure their continuance. An accurate  record of the pedigrees of animals, together with a record of such  premiums as they may have taken, cannot fail to afford a guide, to some  extent, in breeding with reference to special objects--the principle,  that \"Like begets Like,\" being admitted as a general law. The subject of  publishing a Herd Book for Ayrshires, in Scotland, has been agitated on  several occasions, but, down to the present time, no direct action has  been taken on it. The enterprise of the American breeders of this  variety of cattle, in taking the lead in this matter, is highly  creditable, and, if properly followed up, will be sure to bring a just  recompense of reward.

FOOTNOTE:    [A] As a further explanation of the preference given by Burns for the  \"West-Country cows,\" the writer would mention, that in 1858, he had  several interviews with the poet's sister, the late Mrs. Begg, of Ayr,  in one of which, she stated that her brother, during his occupancy of  the farm of Ellisland, near Dumfries, kept a dairy, and made  considerable quantities of cheese. Thus his efforts to procure the  Ayrshire cow, shows that they had, even at that time, a high reputation  for this object.
