Yet nothing  is wasted, for after waiting what appears to her a reasonable time, and  giving them every encouragement, and with the most exemplary patience,  she teaches them what they should do, and how, by slowly making a meal  of the residue herself, frequently stopping and fondling and licking  them in the hope they will yet make another effort. What can be more  sensitively touching than the following anecdote, sent to _The Animal  World_ by C. E. N., in 1876? It is a little poem of everyday life, full  of deep feeling and feline love.    \"I have a small tabby cat, very comely and graceful. Being very fond of  her kitten, she is always uneasy if she loses sight of it if only for a  short time. For the last six weeks, the mother, failing to recall the  truant back by her voice, even returns to the kitchen for the lower  portion of a rabbit's fore-leg, which has served as a plaything for some  time. With this in her mouth, she proceeds to search for her lost one,  crying all the time, and, putting it down at her feet, repeats her  entreaties, to which the kitten, allured by the sight of its plaything,  generally responds. Owing to its gambols in the open air during the  inclement weather, the kitten was seized with an affliction of the  throat; the mother, puzzled with the prostration of its offspring,  brought down the rabbit's foot to attract attention. In vain; the kitten  died. Even now the loving mother searches for the rabbit's foot, and  brings it down.\"    An instance of the peculiar foresight and instinct, so often observable  in the cat, is related in _The Animal World_, October, 1882. Miss M.  writes: \"This house is very old, and big impudent rats often appear in  the shop, so a cat is always kept on the premises. Pussy is about five  years old, and is a handsome, light tortoiseshell, with a pretty face  and coaxing ways. A month ago she had three kittens, one of which was  kept; they were born in the drawing-room, by the side of the piano. When  the two were taken away, pussy carried the one remaining to the  fireplace, and made it a bed under the grate with shavings. When a  fortnight old, both were removed downstairs to the room behind the shop.  One day last week an enormous rat appeared; pussy spied him, and set up  her back; but her motherly instinct prevailed. She looked round the  shop, and, finding a drawer high up a little way open, she jumped with  her kitten in her mouth, and dropped it into the drawer, after which she  descended and fought a battle royal with the rat, which she soon  despatched and carried to her mistress, then went back to the drawer and  brought out her kitten.\"    Here is another fact as regards the observation of cats, which possibly,  in this respect, is not far different from some other domestic animals.  \"A gray and white cat, 'Jenny' (a house cat), had three kittens in the  hollow stump of an old ash-tree, some distance from the house. There,  from time to time, she took them food, and there nursed them. One day,  looking from the window, I observed a very heavy storm was approaching,  and also, what should I see but Mistress 'Jenny' running across the  meadow as fast as she could, and, on her drawing nearer, I noticed that  she had one of her kittens in her mouth. She ran past and put the kitten  into a small outhouse, when she immediately hastened back, and returned  bringing another of her kittens, which she put in the same place. Again  she started for the wood, and shortly reappeared bringing her third and  last kitten, though more slowly, seemingly very tired. I was just  thinking of going to help her, when she suddenly quickened her pace and  ran for the outhouse; just then a few drops of rain began to fall. In a  few moments a deluge of water was falling, the lightning was flashing,  the thunder crashed overhead and rumbled in the distance, but 'Jenny'  did not mind, for she had her three kittens comfortably housed, and she  and they were all nestled together in an apple basket, warm and dry.  Surely she must have known, by instinct or observation, that the storm  was coming.\"--From my Book of \"_Animal Stories, Old and New_.\"    Should it be deemed necessary to destroy some, if not all of the litter,  which, unfortunately, is sometimes the case, it is not well to take away  the whole at once; but it is advisable to let a day or two intervene  between each removal; the mother will thus be relieved of much  suffering, especially if one at least is left for her to rear, but two  is preferable. Still, when the progeny are well-marked or otherwise  valuable, and large specimens are required for show or other purposes,  three kittens are enough to leave, though some advocate as many as five;  but if this is done it is better to provide a foster-mother for two, for  which even a dog will often prove a very good substitute for one of the  feline race. In either case, slightly warm new milk should be given at  least three times a day; the milk should not be heated, but some hot  water put to it, and as soon as their teeth are sufficiently grown for  them to be of use in mastication give some raw beef cut very small and  fine. Some prefer chopped liver; I do not; but never give more than they  can lap or eat at each meal. This liberal treatment will make a  wonderful difference in their growth, and also their general health and  strength; and being so fed makes them more docile. And it should be  borne in mind that in a state of nature cats always bring raw food to  their young as soon as they are able to eat; therefore raw meat is far  the best to give them--their dentition proves this.    [Illustration]          KITTENS.      Kittenhood, the baby time especially of country cats, is with most the  brightest, sprightliest, and prettiest period of their existence, and  perhaps the most happy. True, when first born and in the earliest era of  their lives, they are blind, helpless little things, dull, weak, and  staggering, scarcely able to stand, if at all, almost rolling over at  every attempt, making querulous, fretful noises, if wakeful or cold, or  for the time motherless. But 'tis not for long; awhile, and she, the  fondest of mothers, is with them. They are nestled about her, or amid  her soft, warm fluffy fur, cossetted with parental tenderness, caressed,  nurtured, and, with low, sweet tones and fondlings, they are soothed  again and again to sleep.--They sleep.--Noiseless, and with many a  longing, lingering look, the careful, watchful, loving creature slowly  and reluctantly steals away; soon to return, when she and her little  ones are lost \"in the land of dreams.\" And so from day to day, until  bright, meek-eyed, innocent, inquiring little faces, with eager eyes,  peep above the basket that is yet their home. One bolder than the others  springs out, when, scared at its own audacity, as quickly, and oft  clumsily, scrambles back, then out--in--and out, in happy, varied, wild,  frolicsome, gambolsome play, they clutch, twist, turn, and wrestle in  artless mimicry of desperate quarrelling;--the struggle over, in  liveliest antics they chase and rechase in turn, or in fantastic mood  play; 'tis but play, and such wondrous play--bright, joyous, and light;  and so life glides on with them as kittens--frisky, skittish, playful  kittens.    A few more days, and their mother leads them forth, with many an anxious  look and turn, softly calling in a subdued voice, they halting almost at  every step; suddenly, oft at nothing, panic-stricken, quickly scamper  back, not one yet daring to follow where all is so oddly strange and  new, their natural shyness being stronger than the love of freedom.  Again, with scared look and timid steps, they come, when again at  nothing frightened, or with infantile pretence, they are off,  \"helter-skelter,\" without a pause or stay, one and all, they o'er and  into their basket clamber, tumble in, turn about and stare with a more  than half-bewildered, self-satisfied safety look about them. Gaining  courage once more, they peer about, with dreamy, startled, anxious eyes,  watching for dangers that never are, although expected. Noiseless comes  their patient, loving mother; with what new delight they cling about  her; how fondly and tenderly she tends them, lures, cossets, coaxes, and  talks, as only a gentle mother-cat can--\"There is no danger,  no!--nothing to fear. Is she not with them; will she not guard, keep and  defend them? There is a paradise out there; through this door; they must  see it. Come, she will show them; come, have confidence! Now,  then--come!\" When followed by her three little ones, and they with much  misgiving, she passes out--out into the garden, out among the lovely,  blooming, fragrant roses, out among the sweet stocks and the  damask-coloured gilly-flowers, the pink daisies, brown, red, and orange  wallflowers, the spice-scented pinks, and other gay and modest floral  beauties that make so sweet the soft and balmy breath of Spring. Out  into the sunshine, almost dazed amid a flood of light, warmed by the  glowing midday sun. Light above, light around and everywhere about;  while the sweet-scented breezes come joy-laden with the happy wild  birds' melodious songs; wearied with wonderment, under the  flower-crowned lilacs they gather themselves to rest. How beautiful all  is, how full of young delights; the odorous wind fans, soothes, and  lulls them to rest, while rustling leaves softly whisper them to  sleep--they and their loving mother slumber unconscious of all things,  and with all things at peace. There, stretched in the warm sunshine  asleep, possibly dreaming of their after-life when they are kittens no  longer, they rest and--sleep.    Their young, bright life has begun; how charming "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35470"],[0,"Key to the Science of Theology (#20)"],[1," in truth unto the end. Great shall be their reward  and eternal shall be their glory; and to them will I reveal all  mysteries, yea, all the hidden mysteries of my kingdom from days of  old, and for ages to come will I make known unto them the good  pleasure of my will concerning all things pertaining to my kingdom;  yea, even the wonders of eternity shall they know, and things to come  will I show them, even the things of many generations; and their  wisdom shall be great, and their understanding reach to heaven: and  before them the wisdom of the wise shall perish, and the understanding  of the prudent shall come to naught, for by my Spirit will I enlighten  them, and by my power will I make known unto them the secrets of my  will; yea, even those things which eye has not seen, nor ear heard,  nor yet entered into the heart of man.    \"We, Joseph Smith, jun., and Sidney Rigdon, being in the Spirit on the  sixteenth of February, in the year of our Lord, one thousand eight  hundred and thirty-two, by the power of the Spirit our eyes were  opened and our understandings were enlightened, so as to see and  understand the things of God--even those things which were from the  beginning, before the world was, which were ordained of the Father,  through His only begotten Son, who was in the bosom of the Father,  even from the beginning, of whom we bear record, and the record which  we bear is the fulness of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, who is the Son,  whom we saw and with whom we conversed in the heavenly vision; for  while we were doing the work of translation, which the Lord had  appointed unto us, we came to the twenty-ninth verse of the fifth  chapter of John, which was given unto us as follows. Speaking of the  resurrection of the dead, concerning those who shall hear the voice of  the Son of man, and shall come forth; they who have done good in the  resurrection of the just, and they who have done evil in the  resurrection of the unjust. Now this caused us to marvel, for it was  given unto us of the Spirit; and while we meditated upon these things,  the Lord touched the eyes of our understandings and they were opened,  and the glory of the Lord shone round about; and we beheld the glory  of the Son, on the right hand of the Father, and received of his  fulness; and saw the holy angels, and they who are sanctified before  His throne, worshipping God and the Lamb, who worship Him for ever and  ever. And now, after the many testimonies which have been given of  him, this is the testimony last of all, which we give of him, that he  lives; for we saw him, even on the right hand of God, and we heard the  voice bearing record that he is the only begotten of the Father--that  by him and through him, and of him the worlds are and were created,  and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto God.  And this we saw also, and bear record, that an angel of God who was in  authority in the presence of God, who rebelled against the only  begotten Son, whom the Father loved, and who was in the bosom of the  Father, was thrust down from the presence of God and the Son, and was  called Perdition, for the heavens wept over him--he was Lucifer, a son  of the morning. And we beheld, and lo, he is fallen! is fallen! even a  son of the morning. And while we were yet in the Spirit, the Lord  commanded us that we should write the vision, for we beheld Satan,  that old serpent--even the devil, who rebelled against God, and sought  to take the kingdom of our God, and His Christ, wherefore he maketh  war with the Saints of God, and encompasses them round about. And we  saw a vision of the sufferings of those with whom he made war and  overcame, for thus came the voice of the Lord unto us.    \"Thus saith the Lord, concerning all those who know my power, and have  been made partakers thereof, and suffered themselves, through the  power of the devil, to be overcome, and to deny the truth and defy my  power--they are they who are the sons of perdition, of whom I say that  it had been better for them never to have been born, for they are  vessels of wrath, doomed to suffer the wrath of God, with the devil  and his angels in eternity; concerning whom I have said there is no  forgiveness in this world nor in the world to come, having denied the  Holy Spirit after having received it, and having denied the only  begotten Son of the Father--having crucified him unto themselves, and  put him to an open shame. These are they who shall go away into the  lake of fire and brimstone, with the devil and his angels, and the  only ones on whom the second death shall have any power; yea, verily,  the only ones who shall not be redeemed in the due time of the Lord,  after the sufferings of his wrath; for all the rest shall be brought  forth by the resurrection of the dead, through the triumph and the  glory of the Lamb, who was slain, who was in the bosom of the Father  before the worlds were made. And this is the Gospel, the glad tidings  which the voice out of the heavens bore record unto us, that he came  into the world, even Jesus, to be crucified for the world, and to bear  the sins of the world, and to sanctify the world, and to cleanse it  from all unrighteousness; that through him all might be saved whom the  Father had put into his power and made by him, who glorifies the  Father, and saves all the works of his hands, except those sons of  perdition, who deny the Son after the Father has revealed him;  wherefore, he saves all except them; they shall go away into  everlasting punishment, which is endless punishment, which is eternal  punishment, to reign with the devil and his angels in eternity, where  their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched, which is their  torment; and the end thereof, neither the place thereof, nor their  torment, no man knows, neither was it revealed, neither is, neither  will be revealed unto man, except to them who are made partakers  thereof: nevertheless I, the Lord, show it by vision unto many, but  straightway shut it up again; wherefore the end, the width, the  height, the depth, and the misery thereof, they understand not,  neither any man except them who are ordained unto this condemnation.  And we heard the voice, saying, Write the vision, for lo! this is the  end of the vision of the sufferings of the ungodly!    \"And again we bear record, for we saw and heard, and this is the  testimony of the Gospel of Christ, concerning them who come forth in  the resurrection of the just; they are they who received the testimony  of Jesus, and believed on his name and were baptized after the manner  of his burial, being buried in the water in his name, and this  according to the commandment, which he has given, that by keeping the  commandments they might be washed and cleansed from all their sins,  and receive the Holy Spirit by the laying on of the hands of him who  is ordained and sealed unto this power, and who overcome by faith, and  are sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise, which the Father sheds forth  upon all those who are just and true. They are they who are the Church  of the first born. They are they into whose hands the Father has given  all things. They are they who are priests and kings, who have received  of His fulness, and of His glory, and are priests of the Most High,  after the order of Melchisedek, which was after the order of Enoch,  which was after the order of the only begotten Son; wherefore, as it  is written, they are gods, even the sons of God; wherefore all things  are theirs, whether life or death, or things present, or things to  come, all are theirs and they are Christ's and Christ is God's; and  they shall overcome all things; wherefore let no man glory in man, but  rather let him glory in God, who shall subdue all enemies under His  feet--these shall dwell in the presence of God and His Christ for ever  and ever. These are they whom he shall bring with him, when he shall  come in the clouds of heaven, to reign on the earth over his people.  These are they who shall have part in the first resurrection. These  are they who shall come forth in the resurrection of the just. These  are they who are come unto Mount Zion, and unto the city of the living  God, the heavenly place, the holiest of all. These are they who have  come to an innumerable company of angels, to the general assembly and  Church of Enoch, and of the first born. These are they whose names are  written in heaven, where God and Christ are the judge of all. These  are they who are just men made perfect through Jesus the mediator of  the new covenant, who wrought out this perfect atonement through the  shedding of his own blood. These are they whose bodies are celestial  whose glory is that of the sun, even the glory of God, the highest of  all, whose glory the sun of the firmament is written of as being  typical.    \"And again, we saw the terrestrial world, and behold and lo, these are  they who are of the terrestrial, whose glory differs from that of the  Church of the first-born, who have received the fulness of the Father,  even as that of the moon differs from the sun in the firmament--  behold, these are they who died without law, and also they who are the  spirits of men kept in prison, whom the Son visited, and preached the  Gospel unto, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh,  who received not the testimony of Jesus in the flesh, but afterwards  received it. These are they who are honourable men of the earth, who  were blinded by the craftiness of men. These are they who receive of  his glory, but not of his fulness. These are they who receive of the  presence of the Son, but not of the fulness of the Father; wherefore,  they are bodies terrestrial, and not bodies celestial, and differ in  glory as the moon differs from the sun. These are they who are not  valiant in the testimony of Jesus; wherefore they obtained not the  crown over the kingdom of our God. And now this is the"]]]
