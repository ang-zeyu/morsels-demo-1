[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25887"],[0,"Lola; Or, The Thought and Speech of Animals (#20)"],[1,"As a result of all that has here been stated, the question may very  naturally arise: are there any indications such as lead to suspect a  change of character, or do any other practical results follow on these  educational tests? Now, Lola is by nature lovable, lively, full of fun,  and she has retained these traits to the present day. Her great  excitability has diminished, it is true, but this is probably due to  her having grown more staid with years. Yet a difference is also to be  found where her character--her dog-soul--is in question: it may be  noticed in the suspicious way in which she now regards people, as  though she were \"drawing comparisons\" between them and herself. We  have, in fact, fallen somewhat in her estimation. She \"asks\"--so to  speak--as to where our vaunted superiority may lie, and would seem to  compare her newly-acquired knowledge--together with the existence  forced upon her--with the life that is ours. Since she has made these  \"educational advances\" one can often see in her eyes something that  amounts to an angry reproach--something like an impatient question, as  to _why_ we have so much food and freedom as compared with what is  meted out to her. She follows our thoughts to a great extent, and our  abilities no longer seem to impress her, since--to her--it is only  those which she herself has mastered that come under this heading at  all, and here--a slight contempt for the \"oppressor\" is often  discernable. There is also a greater show of independence and frequent  contrariness, owing to her diminished respect for our \"species,\" in  short--it becomes more difficult to deal with the dog. The days of  blind confidence are past--even though an innate sense of devotion to  man remains, for what has just been said, seems always to occur more as  the result of \"moments of reflection.\" Indeed, this entire educational  process would have little that is joyful about it, were it not for the  feeling that the animal understands its friend, and is in a position to  converse with us within certain limits, and this outweighs and  compensates for all the rest!    As to the practical results--I can say little that is favourable. The  dog's _thinking_ seems to be at variance with her acts: thought can  therefore, have little influence upon a dog's behaviour, for--as has  been the case with dogs of every kind, from time immemorial--its  actions are due to the excitement of the outer senses, such as scent,  taste, and hearing, and any emotions observable are but the direct and  inward continuation of those external sensations, and, as such, last  but for a given time. What we may term the \"thought form\" that is bound  to any given _word_, representing objective thought in its simplest  form, rotates within a very limited circle, and is powerless over the  animal's feeling. For instance: Lola knows that she is forbidden to  \"hunt\" i.e. to go after the game, etc., indeed she has shown in many of  her replies that she is well aware of what \"totgeschossen\" ( = to be  shot dead) means. And yet--once the scent is up, off she goes, and  nothing will prevent her--for, she _must_ go!    This is a particularly strong characteristic which beating and being  deprived of her food may sometimes _check_, but which her own powers of  reflection do not cure: and it is the same thing with most of her  faults. At times it will be unreasoning obstinacy, but even where she  uses a certain amount of reflection, the _result_ is identical. It has  been no better where--with the help of thought--we have endeavoured to  bring about actual results. An animal can be got to understand and  carry out certain injunctions, such as--\"sit up and beg,\" \"lift up your  paw,\" \"go to your bed,\" \"go out of the door,\" and much more of the  same description, while after instruction it will understand \"behind  the stove lies a biscuit,\" yet _action_ seldom results from such  knowledge. The dog's eyes will brighten, and it is evident that it has  perfectly well comprehended the meaning of the words, indeed--this much  can be easily ascertained by questioning it--but the dog will seem  incapable of translating what it has comprehended into action. At such  times Lola will rush about, as if her limbs would not obey--as though  the influence she could bring to bear on them was not sufficiently  powerful--and the final result is excitement. Connexion with the  motor-nerves does not come into being in response to the action of the  cerebrum. As the result of repeated written and spoken orders it is  possible (with a certain amount of additional aid) to set up this  connexion from without, yet, even then, the actual effect is but  moderately successful. On the other hand, action in the reverse  way--from the nerves or senses to the brain--is easy where the dog is  concerned. Lola can report about things she has done, such as--\"saw  deer,\" \"drank milk,\" \"went into wood,\" \"was naughty,\" \"ate some of the  cow,\" for reflection gives more time to master the subject, and to  notice what is past, and this will therefore show, that in the way of  practical results, the best will be those obtained by asking a dog what  he has seen, heard, or scented, etc. Indeed, it is along these lines  that the police dogs have proved their worth and importance. Yet it is  very necessary that one should make sure that one's dog is not a liar,  but an animal capable of taking up its job in the right manner. With  our present knowledge, however, we are unlikely to achieve very much,  since we cannot say to a dog--\"go here or there\"--or--\"take this letter  to so and so.\"    Not but what dogs have--in exceptional cases and after training--learnt  to carry out such instructions, but it has resulted _without their  thought-activity having been developed_. They get familiar with a  certain road, and--basket in mouth--they will proceed to the baker's  but--independently of habit and external impression--by the mere appeal  to the brain or by means of the most persuasive words, we can attain to  nothing worth mentioning, nothing that could be of distinct value,  where a dog is kept for use. The sense, the object, and the reason for  this educational work must be sought on other grounds.          A VARIETY OF ANSWERS      It was some time after Lola had mastered the art of spelling before I  was able to get her to make independent replies. The first of these was  given on the 13 April, 1916, and from that time onward they became  easier and more frequent: most of those I have set down date from that  period. These answers were at once noted, according to their numerals,  and when the sentence was complete it was transposed into letters of  the alphabet. Whenever there were any spelling mistakes, the words were  placed before her, and she was told to name each successive wrong  letter in reading over her answer. As _I_ knew the equivalent letters,  I was able to write them down at once, and if the reply was a short one  and no paper at hand, I could memorize the letters, and enter them in a  book as soon as the lesson was over--adding the questions to which such  answers had been given as well as the dates. All other questions and  answers, as well as particulars relating to new exercises were also set  down here.    Here is an answer I received from her on the 13 April, 1916: Lola was  staying with me at Hohenheim, where we had arrived on the previous day,  and I proceeded to Stuttgart in the morning. When I got home in the  evening I asked Lola: \"Is it nice here? have you had good food at  father's?\" to which the answer--quite wide of the mark--was--\"wo wald?\"  ( = where is the wood?) For I had been telling her about all she would  be able to enjoy and that, among other delights, there would be the  woods; as however, her afternoon walk had only lain through the fields,  her mind was now absorbed with the one idea--\"where was the wood?\"--to  the oblivion of everything else.    15 April: On this day the written question was put to her: \"Why does  Lola like going in the woods?\" the reply was at once forthcoming, and I  dictated it to Frau Professor Kindermann. \"Where there is wood also  deer and hare\"--she was not quite clear in her spelling at first,  indeed, in this respect she sometimes reminds one of a foreigner--as  also in the matter of her grammatical mistakes.    The next day, after having done a few sums to please some friends who  were present, she was asked: \"Who is the dog in the room?\" \"I!\" she  replied--not \"Lola\" as we had all expected. (Rolf has as yet never  alluded to himself as \"I\"!)    Two days later she was asked in writing: \"How many dogs can reckon and  spell?\" To this she began her reply in a very brisk and lively mood,  but soon wavered, as though at a loss for the right expressions, then  followed a short pause--and finally she resumed her rapping with  renewed animation. The reply, it will be noticed, is detailed, and does  not keep to the plain question that had been put. \"how many have been  taken (for it)? Rolf talks, counts; two more\" (short pause) \"I also,  also heinz and ilse.\" For, so as to fire her ambition, I had told her  about her brother and sister, Heinz and Ilse.    19 April: \"Lola,\" I asked, \"what was it that ran away from you on the  meadow?\" \"cat!\" \"What did you want to do with the poor cat?\" \"kill!\"  \"Have you no pity?\" \"no!\" \"Then is the cat right if she kills you?\"  \"_no!_\" \"Why?\" (The reply to this was rapped indistinctly.) \"Have you  no pity for any man or animal?\" \"for dog!\"...    22 April: I had told her that my brother was coming, and that he wore a  field-grey coat and was a soldier. When he arrived I said to her: \"Who  is this?\" \"Your brother.\"    Next day she was asked in writing: \"What did Lola see swimming in the  water?\" \"duck!\" I had shown her a duck on the previous afternoon.    26 April: On this day Lola appeared before Professors Kraemer, Mack,  Kindermann and Ziegler, of Hohenheim, which resulted"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25918"],[0,"Heads and Tales : or, Anecdotes and Stories of Quadrupeds and Other Beasts, (#20)"],[1,"dinations. The son and biographer of the latter  says:[72]--\"I rode with them from Bristol to Wells, and can now, in  imagination, see Mr Hall smoking and reclining on one seat of the  carriage, while my father sat on the other. I can see Mr Hall descending  at a blacksmith's shop to re-light his pipe, making his way directly to  the forge, and jumping aside with unwonted agility, when a huge dog  growled at him. I can recall his look, when rallied on his agility,  after his return to the carriage. 'You seemed afraid of the dog, sir,'  said my father. 'Apostolic advice, sir--Beware of dogs,' rejoined Mr  Hall.\" Dr Leifchild, in another part of the memoir (p. 360), relates  that some housekeeper would exclaim to him, as he was about to enter the  house of friend or stranger, \"Don't be afraid of the dog, sir, he never  bites.\"--\"Are you quite sure he never bites?\" was his prompt  question.--\"Quite sure, sir,\" rejoined the servant.--\"Then,\" rejoined  the good-humoured doctor, \"if he never _bites_, how does he live?\"      A QUEEN AND HER LAP-DOG.    Henrietta Maria, Queen of Charles I., on her return to Burlington Bay  with assistance for her husband, was attacked in the house where she  slept by the cannonade of five ships of war belonging to the  Parliament. She left the house amid the whistling of balls, one of which  killed one of her servants. When on her way to the shelter of a ditch,  she remembered that an aged lap-dog, called \"Mitte,\" was left behind.  She was much attached to this old favourite, and returned to the house  she had left. Rushing up-stairs into her chamber, she caught up her old  pet, which was reposing on her bed, and carried her off in safety.  Having done this, the queen and her ladies gained the ditch, and  crouched down in it, while the cannon played furiously over their  heads.[73]      THE CLEVER DOG THAT BELONGED TO THE HUNTERS OF POLMOOD.    The estate of Polmood, in Peeblesshire, was the subject of extraordinary  litigation, and a volume of considerable bulk is devoted to its history.  This work contains much curious evidence from aged country folks in the  western parts of the country. Mr Chambers[74] tells us that in the  history \"reminiscences concerning a wonderfully clever dog are put  forward as links in the line of propinquity.\" The deponent has heard his  father say that Robert Hunter had a remarkable dog called \"Algiers;\" and  that, when Robert lived at Woodend, he used to tie a napkin round the  dog's neck with money in it, and send him for snuff to Lammington, which  is about three miles from Woodend, and that the dog executed his  message faithfully, and prevented everybody from laying hold of or  stopping him. Another venerable deponent, aged eighty-nine, had heard  his mother tell many stories about a dog belonging to Uncle Robert,  which went by the name of \"Algiers;\" that they used to cut a fleece off  him every year sufficient to make a pair of stockings; and that Uncle  Robert used to tie a purse round his neck, with money in it, and the dog  then swam the Tweed, and brought back tobacco from the Crook! And a  third declares that \"Algiers\" could be sent to Edinburgh with a letter,  and bring back a letter to his master.      THE IRISH CLERGYMAN AND THE DOGS.    Mr Fitzpatrick, in his anecdotal memoirs of Archbishop Whately, tells a  story of an eccentric Irish parson. This person, when preaching, was  interrupted in his homily by two dogs, which began to fight in church.  He descended the pulpit, and endeavoured to separate them. On returning  to his place, the clergyman, who was rather an absent man, asked the  clerk, \"Where was I a while ago?\"--\"Wasn't yer Riverence appaising the  dogs?\" responded the other.[75]      WASHINGTON IRVING AND THE DOG.    Patrick Fraser Tytler, author of \"The History of Scotland,\" in a letter  to his wife in 1830, says--\"At Lady Morton's, one evening, I met with  Washington Irving. I had heard him described as a very silent man, who  was always observing others, but seldom opened his lips. Instead of  which, his tongue never lay still; and he gets out more wee wordies in a  minute than any ordinary converser does in five. But I found him a very  intelligent and agreeable man. I put him in mind of his travelling with  our dear Tommy. He had at first no recollection; but I brought it back  to his memory by the incident of the little black dog, who always went  before the horses in pulling up hill, and pretended to assist them. I  put him in mind of his own wit, 'that he wondered if the doggie mistook  himself for a horse;' at which he laughed, and added, 'Yes, and thought  it very hard that he was not rubbed down at the end of the  journey.'\"[76]      DOUGLAS JERROLD AND HIS DOG.    Jerrold had a favourite dog that followed him everywhere. One day in the  country, a lady, who was passing, turned round and said audibly, \"What  an ugly little brute!\" Whereupon Jerrold, addressing the lady, replied,  \"Oh, madam! I wonder what he thinks _about us_ at this moment.\"[77]      SHERIDAN AND THE DOG.    After witnessing the first representation of a dog-piece by Reynolds,  called the \"Caravan,\" Sheridan suddenly came into the green-room, on  purpose, it was imagined, to wish the author joy. \"Where is he?\" was  the first question; \"where is my guardian angel?\"--\"Here I am,\" answered  Reynolds.--\"Pooh!\" replied Sheridan, \"I don't mean _you_, I mean _the  dog_.\"[78]      CHARLES LAMB AND HIS DOG.    Thomas Hood had a dog called \"Dash.\" This dog he gave to Charles Lamb.  The ready-witted Elia often took the creature out with him when walking  at Enfield. On one occasion, the dog dashed off to chase some young  sheep. The owner of the muttons came out quite indignant at the owner,  to expostulate with him on the assault of Lamb's dog on his sheep. Elia,  with his quiet ready wit, replied, \"Hunt _Lambs_, sir?--why, he never  hunted _me_.\"[79]      FRENCH DOGS, TIME OF LOUIS XI.--HISTORY OF HIS DOG \"RELAIS\" BY LOUIS  XII.    Horace Walpole, in one of his gossiping letters to the Countess of  Ossory in 1781, writes, \"You must not be surprised if I should send you  a collection of Tonton's _bons-mots_. I have found a precedent for such  a work. A grave author wrote a book on the 'Hunt of the Grand Senechal  of Normandy,' and of _les DITS du bon chien Souillard, qui fut au Roi  Loy de France onzieme du nom_. Louis XII., the reverse of the  predecessor of the same name, did not leave to his historian to  celebrate his dog \"Relais,\" but did him the honour of being his  biographer himself; and for a reason that was becoming so excellent a  king. It was _pour animer les descendans d'un si brave chien a se rendre  aussi bons que lui, et encore meilleurs_. It was great pity the Cardinal  d'Amboise had no bastard puppies, or, to be sure, his Majesty would have  written his Prime Minister's life too, for a model to his  successors.\"[80]      MARTIN LUTHER OBSERVES A DOG AT LINTZ.    In the \"Table Talk\" of Martin Luther, it is recorded:--\"I saw a dog at  Lintz, in Austria, that was taught to go with a hand-basket to the  butchers' shambles for meat. When other dogs came about him, and sought  to take the meat out of the basket, he set it down and fought lustily  with them; but when he saw they were too strong for him, he himself  would snatch out the first piece of meat, lest he should lose all. Even  so does now our Emperor Charles; who, after having long protected  spiritual benefices, seeing that every prince takes possession of  monasteries, himself takes possession of bishoprics, as just now he has  seized upon those of Utrecht and Liege.\"[81]      THE POOR DOG AT THE GROTTA DEL CANE.    Henry Matthews,[82] like other visitors of Naples, went to the  celebrated _Grotta del Cane_, or Dog Grotto, on the borders of Lake  Agnano, so called from the vapour in the cave, destructive to animal  life, being shown by means of a dog. In his diary, of March 3, 1818, he  records:--\"Travellers have made a great display of sensibility in their  strictures upon the spectacle exhibited here; but to all appearance the  dog did not care much about it. It may be said, with truth of him, that  he is _used_ to it; for he dies many times a day, and he went to the  place of execution wagging his tail. He became insensible in two  minutes; but upon being laid on the grass, he revived from his trance in  a few seconds, without the process of immersion in the lake, which is  generally mentioned as necessary to his recovery. From the voracity with  which he bolted down a loaf of bread which I bought for him, the vapour  does not seem to injure the animal functions. Addison seems to have been  very particular in his experiments upon the vapour of this cavern. He  found that a pistol would not take fire in it; but upon laying a train  of gunpowder, and igniting it beyond the sphere of the vapour, he found  that it could not intercept the train of fire when it had once begun  flashing, nor hinder it from running to the very end. He subjected a dog  to a second trial in order to ascertain whether he was longer in  expiring the first than the second time; and he found there was no  sensible difference. A viper bore it _nine minutes_ the first time he  put it in, and _ten minutes_ the second; and he attributes the prolonged  duration of the second trial to the large provision of air that the  viper laid in after his first death, upon which stock he supposes it to  have existed a minute longer the second time.\"      DOG, A POSTMAN AND CARRIER.    Robert Southey says, that \"near Moffat a dog used for many years to meet  the mail and receive the letters for a little post-town near.\"[83]    How often may you see a dog carrying a basket or a parcel. No  enticement, even of a dog-friend or of a great bone, will induce this  faithful servant to abandon his charge. Every one must have observed  this.      DOG-MATIC.
