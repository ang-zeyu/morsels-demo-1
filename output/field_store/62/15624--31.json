While interrogating Derues, he kept his eyes fixed upon him; and this  double examination being quite fruitless, only increased his perplexity.  However, he never relaxed the incredulous severity of his demeanour, nor  the imperative and threatening tone of his voice.    \"You acknowledge having been at Lyons?\" he asked.    \"I have been there.\"    \"At the beginning of this examination you said you would explain the  reason of this journey later.\"    \"I am ready to do so, for the journey is connected with the facts I have  just narrated; it was caused by them.\"    \"Explain it.\"    \"I again ask permission to relate fully. I did not hear from Versailles:  I began to fear Monsieur de Lamotte's anxiety would bring him to Paris.  Bound by the promise I had made to his wife to avert all suspicion and  to satisfy any doubts he might conceive, and, must I add, also  remembering that it was important for me to inform him of our new  arrangements, and of this payment of a hundred thousand livres.\"    \"That payment is assuredly fictitious,\" interrupted Monsieur de Lamotte;  \"we must have some proof of it.\"    \"I will prove it presently,\" answered Derues. \"So I went to Buisson, as  I have already told you. On my return I found a letter from Madame de  Lamotte, a letter with a Paris stamp, which had arrived that morning. I  was surprised that she should write, when actually in Paris; I opened  the letter, and was still more surprised. I have not the letter with me,  but I recollect the sense of it perfectly, if not the wording, and I can  produce it if necessary. Madame de Lamotte was at Lyons with her son and  this person whose name I do not know, and whom I do not care to mention  before her husband. She had confided this letter to a person who was  coming to Paris, and who was to bring it me; but this individual, whose  name was Marquis, regretted that having to start again immediately, he  was obliged to entrust it to the post. This is the sense of its  contents. Madame de Lamotte wrote that she found herself obliged to  follow this nameless person to Lyons; and she begged me to send her news  of her husband and of the state of his affairs, but said not one single  word of any probable return. I became very uneasy at the news of this  clandestine departure. I had no security except a private contract  annulling our first agreement on the payment of one hundred thousand  livres, and that this was not a sufficient and regular receipt I knew,  because the lawyer had already refused to surrender Monsieur de  Lamotte's power of attorney. I thought over all the difficulties which  this flight, which would have to be kept secret, was likely to produce,  and I started for Lyons without writing or giving any notice of my  intention. I had no information, I did not even know whether Madame de  Lamotte was passing by another name, as at Versailles, but chance  decreed that I met her the very day of my arrival. She was alone, and  complained bitterly of her fate, saying she had been compelled to follow  this individual to Lyons, but that very soon she would be free and would  return to Paris. But I was struck by the uncertainty of her manner, and  said I should not leave her without obtaining a deed in proof of our  recent arrangements. She refused at first, saying it was unnecessary, as  she would so soon return; but I insisted strongly. I told her I had  already com promised myself by telling Monsieur de Lamotte that she was  at Versailles, endeavouring to procure an appointment for her son; that  since she had been compelled to come to Lyons, the same person might  take her elsewhere, so that she might disappear any day, might leave  France without leaving any trace, without any written acknowledgment of  her own dishonour; and that when all these falsehoods were discovered, I  should appear in the light of an accomplice. I said also that, as she  had unfortunately lodged in my house in Paris, and had requested me to  remove her son from his school, explanations would be required from me,  and perhaps I should be accused of this double disappearance. Finally, I  declared that if she did not give me some proofs of her existence,  willingly or unwillingly, I would go at once to a magistrate. My  firmness made her reflect. 'My good Monsieur Derues,' she said, 'I ask  your forgiveness for all the trouble I have caused you. I will give you  this deed to-morrow, to-day it is too late; but come to this same place  to-morrow, and you shall see me again.' I hesitated, I confess, to let  her go. 'Ah,' she said, grasping my hands, 'do not suspect me of  intending to deceive you! I swear that I will meet you here at four  o'clock. It is enough that I have ruined myself, and perhaps my son,  without also entangling you in my unhappy fate. Yes, you are right; this  deed is important, necessary for you, and you shall have it. But do not  show yourself here; if you were seen, I might not be able to do what I  ought to do. To-morrow you shall see me again, I swear it.' She then  left me. The next day, the 12th, of March, I was exact at the  rendezvous, and Madame de Lamotte arrived a moment later. She gave me a  deed, authorising her husband to receive the arrears of thirty thousand  livres remaining from the purchase-money of Buisson-Souef. I endeavoured  again to express my opinion of her conduct; she listened in silence, as  if my words affected her deeply. We were walking together, when she told  me she had some business in a house we were passing, and asked me to  wait for her. I waited more than an hour, and then discovered that this  house, like many others in Lyons, had an exit in another street; and I  understood that Madame de Lamotte had escaped by this passage, and that  I might wait in vain. Concluding that trying to follow her would be  useless, and seeing also that any remonstrance would be made in vain, I  returned to Paris, deciding to say nothing as yet, and to conceal the  truth as long as possible. I still had hopes, and I did not count on  being so soon called on to defend myself: I thought that when I had to  speak, it would be as a friend, and not as an accused person. This, sir,  is the explanation of my conduct, and I regret that this justification,  so easy for myself, should be so cruelly painful for another. You have  seen the efforts which I made to defer it.\"    Monsieur de Lamotte had heard this second part of Derues' recital with a  more silent indignation, not that he admitted its probability, but he  was confounded by this monstrous imposture, and, as it were,  terror-stricken by such profound hypocrisy. His mind revolted at the  idea of his wife being accused of adultery; but while he repelled this  charge with decision, he saw the confirmation of his secret terrors and  presentiments, and his heart sank within him at the prospect of  exploring this abyss of iniquity. He was pale, gasping for breath, as  though he himself had been the criminal, while scorching tears furrowed  his cheeks. He tried to speak, but his voice failed; he wanted to fling  back at Derues the names of traitor and assassin, and he was obliged to  bear in silence the look of mingled grief and pity which the latter  bestowed upon him.    The magistrate, calmer, and master of his emotions, but tolerably  bewildered in this labyrinth of cleverly connected lies, thought it  desirable to ask some further questions.    \"How,\" said he, \"did you obtain this sum of a hundred thousand livres  which you say you paid over to Madame de Lamotte?\"    \"I have been engaged in business for several years, and have acquired  some fortune.\"    \"Nevertheless, you have postponed the obligation of making this payment  several times, so that Monsieur de Lamotte had begun to feel uneasiness  on the subject. This was the chief reason of his wife's coming to  Paris.\"    \"One sometimes experiences momentary difficulties, which presently  disappear.\"    \"You say you have a deed given you at Lyons by Madame de Lamotte, which  you were to give to her husband?\"    \"It is here.\"    The magistrate examined the deed carefully, and noted the name of the  lawyer in whose office it had been drawn up.    \"You may go,\" he said at last.    \"What!\" exclaimed Monsieur de Lamotte.    Derues stopped, but the magistrate signed to him to go, intimating,  however, that he was on no account to leave Paris.    \"But,\" said Monsieur de Lamotte, when they were alone, \"this man is  indeed guilty. My wife has not betrayed me! She!--forget her duties as a  wife! she was virtue incarnate! Ah! I assure you these terrible  calumnies are invented to conceal double crime! I throw myself at your  feet,--I implore your justice!\"    \"Rise, monsieur. This is only a preliminary examination, and I confess  that, so far, he comes well out of it, for imagination can hardly  understand such a depth of deceit. I watched him closely the whole time,  and I could discover no sign of alarm, no contradiction, in either face  or language; if guilty, he must be the greatest hypocrite that ever  existed. But I shall neglect nothing: if a criminal is allowed to  flatter himself with impunity, he frequently forgets to be prudent, and  I have seen many betray themselves when they thought they had nothing to  fear. Patience, and trust to the justice of both God and man.\"    Several days passed, and Derues flattered him self the danger was over:  his every action mean while was most carefully watched, but so that he  remained unaware of the surveillance. A police officer named Mutel,  distinguished for activity and intelligence beyond his fellows, was  charged with collecting information and following any trail. All his  bloodhounds were in action, and hunted Paris thoroughly, but could trace  nothing bearing on the fate of Madame de Lamotte and her son. Mutel,  however,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2750"],[0,"Joan of Naples (#20)"],[1,"means to take refuge in the convent of Santa Croce  with her two little daughters; and while Louis of Hungary was busy  burning his victims, the unhappy Marie had contrived to make her escape  in the frock of an old monk, and as by a miracle to get on board a ship  that was setting sail for Provence. She related to her sister the  frightful details of the king's cruelty. And soon a new proof of his  implacable hatred confirmed the tales of the poor princess.    Louis's ambassadors appeared at the court of Avignon to demand formally  the queen's condemnation.    It was a great day when Joan of Naples pleaded her own cause before the  pope, in the presence of all the cardinals then at Avignon, all the  ambassadors of foreign powers, and all the eminent persons come from  every quarter of Europe to be present at this trial, unique in the  annals of history. We must imagine a vast enclosure, in whose midst upon  a raised throne, as president of the august tribunal, sat God's vicar on  earth, absolute and supreme judge, emblem of temporal and spiritual  power, of authority human and divine. To right and left of the sovereign  pontiff, the cardinals in their red robes sat in chairs set round in a  circle, and behind these princes of the Sacred College stretched rows of  bishops extending to the end of the hall, with vicars, canons, deacons,  archdeacons, and the whole immense hierarchy of the Church. Facing the  pontifical throne was a platform reserved for the Queen of Naples and  her suite. At the pope's feet stood the ambassadors from the King of  Hungary, who played the part of accusers without speaking a word, the  circumstances of the crime and all the proofs having been discussed  beforehand by a committee appointed for the purpose. The rest of the  hall was filled by a brilliant crowd of high dignitaries, illustrious  captains, and noble envoys, all vying with one another in proud display.  Everyone ceased to breathe, all eyes were fixed on the dais whence Joan  was to speak her own defence. A movement of uneasy curiosity made this  compact mass of humanity surge towards the centre, the cardinals above  raised like proud peacocks over a golden harvest-field shaken in the  breeze.    The queen appeared, hand in hand with her uncle, the old Cardinal of  Perigord, and her aunt, the Countess Agnes. Her gait was so modest and  proud, her countenance so melancholy and pure, her looks so open and  confident, that even before she spoke every heart was hers. Joan was now  twenty years of age; her magnificent beauty was fully developed, but an  extreme pallor concealed the brilliance of her transparent satin skin,  and her hollow cheek told the tale of expiation and suffering. Among the  spectators who looked on most eagerly there was a certain young man with  strongly marked features, glowing eyes, and brown hair, whom we shall  meet again later on in our narrative; but we will not divert our  readers' attention, but only tell them that his name was James of  Aragon, that he was Prince of Majorca, and would have been ready to shed  every drop of his blood only to check one single tear that hung on  Joan's eyelids. The queen spoke in an agitated, trembling voice,  stopping from time to time to dry her moist and shining eyes, or to  breathe one of those deep sighs that go straight to the heart. She told  the tale of her husband's death painfully and vividly, painted  truthfully the mad terror that had seized upon her and struck her down  at that frightful time, raised her hands to her brow with the gesture of  despair, as though she would wrest the madness from her brain--and a  shudder of pity and awe passed through the assembled crowd. It is a fact  that at this moment, if her words were false, her anguish was both  sincere and terrible. An angel soiled by crime, she lied like Satan  himself, but like him too she suffered all the agony of remorse and  pride. Thus, when at the end of her speech she burst into tears and  implored help and protection against the usurper of her kingdom, a cry  of general assent drowned her closing words, several hands flew to their  sword-hilts, and the Hungarian ambassadors retired covered with shame  and confusion.    That same evening the sentence, to the great joy of all, was proclaimed,  that Joan was innocent and acquitted of all concern in the assassination  of her husband. But as her conduct after the event and the indifference  she had shown about pursuing the authors of the crime admitted of no  valid excuse, the pope declared that there were plain traces of magic,  and that the wrong-doing attributed to Joan was the result of some  baneful charm cast upon her, which she could by no possible means  resist. At the same time, His Holiness confirmed her marriage with Louis  of Tarentum, and bestowed on him the order of the Rose of Gold and the  title of King of Sicily and Jerusalem. Joan, it is true, had on the eve  of her acquittal sold the town of Avignon to the pope for the sum of  80,000 florins.    While the queen was pleading her cause at the court of Clement VI, a  dreadful epidemic, called the Black Plague--the same that Boccaccio has  described so wonderfully--was ravaging the kingdom of Naples, and indeed  the whole of Italy. According to the calculation of Matteo Villani,  Florence lost three-fifths of her population, Bologna two-thirds, and  nearly all Europe was reduced in some such frightful proportion. The  Neapolitans were already weary of the cruelties and greed of the  Hungarians, they were only awaiting some opportunity to revolt against  the stranger's oppression, and to recall their lawful sovereign, whom,  for all her ill deeds, they had never ceased to love. The attraction of  youth and beauty was deeply felt by this pleasure-loving people.  Scarcely had the pestilence thrown confusion into the army and town,  when loud cursing arose against the tyrant and his executioners. Louis  of Hungary, suddenly threatened by the wrath of Heaven and the people's  vengeance, was terrified both by the plague and by the riots, and  disappeared in the middle of the night. Leaving the government of Naples  in the hands of Conrad Lupo, one of his captains, he embarked hastily at  Berletta, and left the kingdom in very much the same way as Louis of  Tarentum, fleeing from him, had left it a few months before.    This news arrived at Avignon just when the pope was about to send the  queen his bull of absolution. It was at once decided to take away the  kingdom from Louis's viceroy. Nicholas Acciajuoli left for Naples with  the marvellous bull that was to prove to all men the innocence of the  queen, to banish all scruples and stir up a new enthusiasm. The  counsellor first went to the castle of Melzi, commanded by his son  Lorenzo: this was the only fortress that had always held out. The father  and son embraced with the honourable pride that near relatives may  justly feel when they meet after they have united in the performance of  a heroic duty. From the governor of Melzi Louis of Tarentum's counsellor  learned that all men were wearied of the arrogance and vexatious conduct  of the queen's enemies, and that a conspiracy was in train, started in  the University of Naples, but with vast ramifications all over the  kingdom, and moreover that there was dissension in the enemy's army. The  indefatigable counsellor went from Apulia to Naples, traversing towns  and villages, collecting men everywhere, proclaiming loudly the  acquittal of the queen and her marriage with Louis of Tarentum, also  that the pope was offering indulgences to such as would receive with joy  their lawful sovereigns. Then seeing that the people shouted as he went  by, \"Long live Joan! Death to the Hungarians!\" he returned and told his  sovereigns in what frame of mind he had left their subjects.    Joan borrowed money wherever she could, armed galleys, and left  Marseilles with her husband, her sister, and two faithful advisers,  Acciajuoli and Spinelli, on the 10th of September 1348. The king and  queen not being able to enter at the harbour, which was in the enemy's  power, disembarked at Santa Maria del Carmine, near the river Sebeto,  amid the frenzied applause of an immense crowd, and accompanied by all  the Neapolitan nobles. They made their way to the palace of Messire  Ajutorio, near Porta Capuana, the Hungarians having fortified themselves  in all the castles; but Acciajuoli, at the head of the queen's  partisans, blockaded the fortresses so ably that half of the enemy were  obliged to surrender, and the other half took to flight and were  scattered about the interior of the kingdom. We shall now follow Louis  of Tarentum in his arduous adventures in Apulia, the Calabrias, and the  Abruzzi, where he recovered one by one the fortresses that the  Hungarians had taken. By dint of unexampled valour and patience, he at  last mastered nearly all the more considerable places, when suddenly  everything changed, and fortune turned her back upon him for the second  time. A German captain called Warner, who had deserted the Hungarian  army to sell himself to the queen, had again played the traitor and sold  himself once more, allowed himself to be surprised at Corneto by Conrad  Lupo, the King of Hungary's vicar-general, and openly joined him, taking  along with him a great party of the adventurers who fought under his  orders. This unexpected defection forced Louis of Tarentum to retire to  Naples. The King of Hungary soon learning that the troops had rallied  round his banner, and only awaited his return to march upon the capital,  disembarked with a strong reinforcement of cavalry at the port of  Manfredonia, and taking Trani, Canosa, and Salerno, went forward to lay  siege to Aversa.    The news fell like a thunder-clap on Joan and her husband. The Hungarian  army consisted of 10,000 horse and more than 7000 infantry, and Aversa  had only 500 soldiers under Giacomo Pignatelli.
