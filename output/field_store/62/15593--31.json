Did he punch fer th' Tin-Cup up in  Montana, 'bout twenty years back?\"    \"Shore! Him and Frenchy McAllister punched all over that country an'  they used to paint Cheyenne, too,\" replied Hopalong, eagerly.    \"I knows him, then. I used to know Frenchy, too. Are they comin' up  here?\"    \"Yes,\" responded Hopalong, struggling with another can while waiting for  the fire to catch up. \"Better have some grub with me--don't like to eat  alone,\" invited the cowboy, the reaction of his late rage swinging him  to the other extreme.    When their tobacco had got well started at the close of the meal and  content had taken possession of them Hopalong laughed quietly and  finally spoke:    \"Did yu ever know Aristotle Smith when yu was up in Montana?\"    \"Did I! Well, me an' Aristotle prospected all through that country till  he got so locoed I had to watch him fer fear he'd blow us both up. He  greased th' fryin' pan with dynamite one night, an' we shore had to eat  jerked meat an' canned stuff all th' rest of that trip. What made yu  ask? Is he comin' up too?\"    \"No, I reckons not. Jimmy, th' bartender, said that he cashed in up  at Laramie. Wasn't he th' cuss that built that boat out there on th'  Arizona desert because he was scared that a flood might come? Th' sun  shore warped that punt till it wasn't even good for a hencoop.\"    \"Nope. That was Sister--Annie Tompkins. He was purty near as bad as  Aristotle, though. He roped a puma up on th' Sacramentos, an' didn't  punch no more fer three weeks. Well, here comes my pardner an' I reckons  I'll amble right along. If yu needs any referee or a side pardner in any  ruction yu has only got to warble up my way. So long.\"    The next ten days passed quietly, and on the afternoon of the eleventh  Hopalong's miner friend paid him a visit.    \"Jake recommends yore peaches,\" he laughed as he shook Hopalong's hand.  \"He says yu boosted another of that crowd. That bein' so I thought I  would drop in an' say that they're comin' after yu to-night, shore. Just  heard of it from yore friend Jimmy. Yu can count on us when th' rush  comes. But why didn't yu say yu was a pard of Buck Peters'? Me an' him  used to shoot up Laramie together. From what yore friend James says, yu  can handle this gang by yore lonesome, but if yu needs any encouragement  yu make some sign an' we'll help th' event along some. They's eight of  us that'll be waitin' up to get th' returns an' we're shore goin' to be  in range.\"    \"Gee, it's nice to run across a friend of Buck's! Ain't he a  son-of-a-gun?\" Asked Hopalong, delighted at the news. Then, without  waiting for a reply, he went on: \"Yore shore square, all right, an' I  hates to refuse yore offer, but I got eighteen friends comin' up an'  they ought to get here by tomorrow. Yu tell Jimmy to head them this way  when they shows up an' I'll have th' claim for them. There ain't no  use of yu fellers gettin' mixed up in this. Th' bunch that's comin' can  clean out any gang this side of sunup, an' I expects they'll shore be  anxious to begin when they finds me eatin' peaches an' wastin' my time  shootin' bums. Yu pass th' word along to yore friends, an' tell them to  lay low an' see th' Arory Boerallis hit this town with its tail up. Tell  Jimmy to do it up good when he speaks about me holdin' th' claim--I likes  to see Buck an' Red fight when they're good an' mad.\"    The miner laughed and slapped Hopalong on the shoulder. \"Yore all right,  youngster! Yore just like Buck was at yore age. Say now, I reckons he  wasn't a reg'lar terror on wheels! Why, I've seen him do more foolish  things than any man I knows of, an' I calculate that if Buck pals  with yu there ain't no water in yore sand. My name's Tom Halloway,\" he  suggested.    \"An' mine's Hopalong Cassidy,\" was the reply. \"I've heard Buck speak of  yu.\"    \"Has yu? Well, don't it beat all how little this world is? Somebody  allus turnin' up that knows somebody yu knows. I'll just amble along,  Mr. Cassidy, an' don't yu be none bashful about callin' if yu needs me.  Any pal of Buck's is my friend. Well, so long,\" said the visitor as he  strode off. Then he stopped and turned around. \"Hey, mister!\" he  called. \"They are goin' to roll a fire barrel down agin yu from behind,\"  indicating by an outstretched arm the point from where it would start.  \"If it burns yu out I'm goin' to take a band from up there,\" pointing to  a cluster of rocks well to the rear of where the crowd would work from,  \"an' I don't care whether yu likes it or not,\" he added to himself.    Hopalong scratched his head and then laughed. Taking up a pick and  shovel, he went out behind the cabin and dug a trench parallel with and  about twenty paces away from the rear wall. Heaping the excavated dirt  up on the near side of the cut, he stepped back and surveyed his labor  with open satisfaction. \"Roll yore fire barrel an' be dogged,\" he  muttered. \"Mebby she won't make a bully light for pot shots, though,\" he  added, grinning at the execution he would do.    Taking up his tools, he went up to the place from where the gang would  roll the barrel, and made half a dozen mounds of twigs, being careful to  make them very flimsy. Then he covered them with earth and packed  them gently. The mounds looked very tempting from the view-point of a  marksman in search of earth-works, and appeared capable of stopping any  rifle ball that could be fired against them. Hopalong looked them over  critically and stepped back.    \"I'd like to see th' look on th' face of th' son-of-a-gun that uses them  for cover--won't he be surprised\" and he grinned gleefully as he pictured  his shots boring through them. Then he placed in the center of each a  chip or a pebble or something that he thought would show up well in the  firelight.    Returning to the cabin, he banked it up well with dirt and gravel,  and tossed a few shovelfuls up on the roof as a safety valve to his  exuberance. When he entered the door he had another idea, and fell to  work scooping out a shallow cellar, deep enough to shelter him when  lying at full length. Then he stuck his head out of the window and  grinned at the false covers with their prominent bull's-eyes.    \"When that prize-winnin' gang of ossified idiots runs up agin' these  fortifications they shore will be disgusted. I'll bet four dollars an'  seven cents they'll think their medicine-man's no good. I hopes that  puff-eyed marshal will pick out that hump with th' chip on it,\" and he  hugged himself in anticipation.    He then cut down a sapling and fastened it to the roof and on it he  tied his neckerchief, which fluttered valiantly and with defiance in  the light breeze. \"I shore hopes they appreciates that,\" he remarked  whimsically, as he went inside the hut and closed the door.    The early part of the evening passed in peace, and Hopalong, tired of  watching in vain, wished for action. Midnight came, and it was not until  half an hour before dawn that he was attacked. Then a noise sent him to  a loophole, where he fired two shots at skulking figures some distance  off. A fusillade of bullets replied; one of them ripped through the door  at a weak spot and drilled a hole in a can of the everlasting peaches.  Hopalong set the can in the frying pan and then flitted from loophole to  loophole, shooting quick and straight. Several curses told him that he  had not missed, and he scooped up a finger of peach juice. Shots thudded  into the walls of his fort in an unceasing stream, and, as it grew  lighter, several whizzed through the loopholes. He kept close to the  earth and waited for the rush, and when it came sent it back, minus two  of its members.    As he reloaded his Colts a bullet passed through his shirt sleeve and he  promptly nailed the marksman. He looked out of a crack in the rear wall  and saw the top of an adjoining hill crowned with spectators, all of  whom were armed. Some time later he repulsed another attack and heard a  faint cheer from his friends on the hill. Then he saw a barrel, blazing  from end to end, roll out from the place he had so carefully covered  with mounds. It gathered speed and bounded over the rough ground,  flashed between two rocks and leaped into the trench, where it crackled  and roared in vain.    \"Now,\" said Hopalong, blazing at the mounds as fast as he could fire his  rifle, \"we'll just see what yu thinks of yore nice little covers.\"    Yells of consternation and pain rang out in a swelling chorus, and legs  and arms jerked and flopped, one man, in his astonishment at the shot  that tore open his cheek, sitting up in plain sight of the marksman.  Roars of rage floated up from the main body of the besiegers, and the  discomfited remnant of barrel-rollers broke for real cover.    Then he stopped another rush from the front, made upon the supposition  that he was thinking only of the second detachment. A hearty cheer arose  from Tom Halloway and his friends, ensconced in their rocky position,  and it was taken up by those on the hill, who danced and yelled their  delight at the battle, to them more humorous than otherwise.    This recognition of his prowess from men of the caliber of his audience  made him feel good, and he grinned: \"Gee, I'll bet Halloway an' his  friends is shore itchin' to get in this,\" he murmured, firing at a head  that was shown for an instant. \"Wonder what Red'll say when Jimmy tells  him--bet he'll plow dust like a cyclone,\" and Hopalong laughed, picturing  to himself the satiation of Red's anger. \"Old red-headed son-of-a-gun,\"  murmured the cowboy affectionately, \"he shore can fight.\"    As he squinted over the sights of his rifle his eye caught sight of a  moving body of men as they cantered over the flats about two miles away.  In his eagerness he forgot to shoot and carefully counted them. \"Nine,\"  he grumbled. \"Wonder what's th' matter?\" Fearing that they were not  his friends. Then"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25502"],[0,"Hero-Myths & Legends of the British Race (#20)"],[1,"and his true heir.\" With great joy they  fell on their knees and kissed him eagerly, and Havelok awoke and  began to scowl furiously, for he thought it was some treacherous  attack; but Ubbe soon undeceived him.    [Illustration: \"With great joy they fell on their knees\"]        \"'Dear lord,' quoth he, 'be thou in naught dismayed,      For in thine eyes methinks I see thy thought--      Dear son, great joy is mine to live this day!      My homage, lord, I freely offer thee:      Thy loyal men and vassals are we all,      For thou art son of mighty Birkabeyn,      And soon shalt conquer all thy father's land,      Though thou art young and almost friendless here.      To-morrow will we swear our fealty due,      And dub thee knight, for prowess unexcelled.'\"    Now Havelok knew that his worst danger was over, and he thanked God  for the friend He had sent him, and left to the good Jarl Ubbe the  management of his cause. Ubbe gathered an assembly of as many mighty  men of the realm, and barons, and good citizens, as he could summon;  and when they were all assembled, pondering what was the cause of this  imperative summons, Ubbe arose and said:    \"Gentles, bear with me if I tell you first things well known to you.  Ye know that King Birkabeyn ruled this land until his death-day, and  that he left three children--one son, Havelok, and two daughters--to  the guardianship of Jarl Godard: ye all heard him swear to keep them  loyally and treat them well. But ye do not know how he kept his oath!  The false traitor slew both the maidens, and would have slain the boy,  but for pity he would not kill the child with his own hands. He bade a  fisherman drown him in the sea; but when the good man knew that it was  the rightful heir, he saved the boy's life and fled with him to  England, where Havelok has been brought up for many years. And now,  behold! here he stands. In all the world he has no peer, and ye may  well rejoice in the beauty and manliness of your king. Come now and  pay homage to Havelok, and I myself will be your leader!\"    Jarl Ubbe turned to Havelok, where he stood with Goldborough beside  him, and knelt before him to do homage, an example which was followed  by all present. At a second and still larger assembly held a fortnight  later a similar oath of fealty was sworn by all, Havelok was dubbed  knight by the noble Ubbe, and a great festival was celebrated, with  sports and amusements for the populace. A council of war and vengeance  was held with the great nobles.      The Death of Godard    Havelok, now acknowledged King of Denmark, was unsatisfied until he had  punished the treacherous Godard, and he took a solemn oath from his  soldiers that they would never cease the search for the traitor till  they had captured him and brought him bound to judgment. After all,  Godard was captured as he was hunting. Grim's three sons, now knighted  by King Havelok, met him in the forest, and bade him come to the king,  who called on him to remember and account for his treatment of  Birkabeyn's children. Godard struck out furiously with his fists, but  Sir Robert the Red wounded him in the right arm. When Godard's men  joined in the combat, Robert and his brothers soon slew ten of their  adversaries, and the rest fled; returning, ashamed at the bitter  reproaches of their lord, they were all slain by Havelok's men. Godard  was taken, bound hand and foot, placed on a miserable jade with his  face to the tail, and so led to Havelok. The king refused to be the  judge of his own cause, and entrusted to Ubbe the task of presiding at  the traitor's trial. No mercy was shown to the cruel Jarl Godard, and  he was condemned to a traitor's death, with torments of terrible  barbarity. The sentence was carried out to the letter, and Denmark  rejoiced in the punishment of a cruel villain.      Death of Godrich    Meanwhile Earl Godrich of Cornwall had heard with great uneasiness  that Havelok had become King of Denmark, and intended to invade  England with a mighty army to assert his wife's right to the throne.  He recognised that his own device to shame Goldborough had turned  against him, and that he must now fight for his life and the usurped  dominion he held over England. Godrich summoned his army to Lincoln  for the defence of the realm against the Danes, and called out every  man fit to bear weapons, on pain of becoming thrall if they failed  him. Then he thus addressed them:        \"Friends, listen to my words, and you will know      'Tis not for sport, nor idle show, that I      Have bidden you to meet at Lincoln here.      Lo! here at Grimsby foreigners are come      Who have already won the Priory.      These Danes are cruel heathen, who destroy      Our churches and our abbeys: priests and nuns      They torture to the death, or lead away      To serve as slaves the haughty Danish jarls.      Now, Englishmen, what counsel will ye take?      If we submit, they will rule all our land,      Will kill us all, and sell our babes for thralls,      Will take our wives and daughters for their own.      Help me, if ever ye loved English land,      To fight these heathen and to cleanse our soil      From hateful presence of these alien hordes.      I make my vow to God and all the saints      I will not rest, nor houseled be, nor shriven,      Until our realm be free from Danish foe!      Accursed be he who strikes no blow for home!\"    The army was inspired with valour by these courageous words, and the  march to Grimsby began at once, with Earl Godrich in command.  Havelok's men marched out gallantly to meet them, and when the battle  joined many mighty deeds of valour were done, especially by the king  himself, his foster-brothers, and Jarl Ubbe. The battle lasted long  and was very fierce and bloody, but the Danes gradually overcame the  resistance of the English, and at last, after a great hand-to-hand  conflict, King Havelok captured Godrich. The traitor earl, who had  lost a hand in the fray, was sent bound and fettered to Queen  Goldborough, who kept him, carefully guarded, until he could be tried  by his peers, since (for all his treason) he was still a knight.    When the English recognised their rightful lady and queen they did  homage with great joy, begging mercy for having resisted their lawful  ruler at the command of a wicked traitor; and the king and queen  pardoned all but Godrich, who was speedily brought to trial at  Lincoln. He was sentenced to be burnt at the stake, and the sentence  was carried out amid general rejoicings.    Now that vengeance was satisfied, Havelok and his wife thought of  recompensing the loyal helpers who had believed in them and supported  them through the long years of adversity. Havelok married one of  Grim's daughters to the Earl of Chester, and the other to Bertram, the  good cook, who became Earl of Cornwall in the place of the felon  Godrich and his disinherited children; the heroic Ubbe was made Regent  of Denmark for Havelok, who decided to stay and rule England, and all  the noble Danish warriors were rewarded with gifts of gold, and lands  and castles. After a great coronation feast, which lasted for forty  days, King Havelok dismissed the Danish regent and his followers, and  after sad farewells they returned to their own country. Havelok and  Goldborough ruled England in peace and security for sixty years, and  lived together in all bliss, and had fifteen children, who all became  mighty kings and queens.          CHAPTER VI: HOWARD THE HALT      Introduction    In every society and in all periods the obligations of family  affection and duty to kinsmen have been recognised as paramount. In  the early European communities a man's first duty was to stand by his  kinsman in strife and to avenge him in death, however unrighteous the  kinsman's quarrel might be.    How pitiful is the aged Priam's lament that he must needs kiss the  hands that slew his dear son Hector, and, kneeling, clasp the knees of  his son's murderer! How sad is Cuchulain's plaint that his son Connla  must go down to the grave unavenged, since his own father slew him,  all unwitting! One remembers, too, Beowulf's words: \"Better it is for  every man that he avenge his friend than that he mourn him much!\"  Since, then, family affection, the laws of honour and duty, and every  recognised standard of life demanded that a kinsman should obtain a  full wergild (or money payment) for his relative's death, unless he  chose to take up the blood-feud against the murderer's family, we can  hardly wonder that some of the heroes of early European literature are  heroes of vengeance. Orestes and Electra are Greek embodiments of the  idea of the sacredness of vengeance for murdered kinsfolk, and similar  feelings are revealed in Gudrun's revenge for the murder of Siegfried  in the \"Nibelungenlied.\" To the Teutonic or Celtic warrior there would  be heroism of a noble type in a just vengeance fully accomplished, and  this heroism would be more easily recognised when the wrongdoer was  rich and powerful, the avenger old, poor, and friendless. While  admitting that the hero of vengeance belongs to and represents only  one side of the civilisation of a somewhat barbaric community, we  must allow that the elements of dogged perseverance, dauntless  courage, and resolute loyalty in some degree redeemed the ferocity and  cruelty of the blood-feud he waged against the ill-doer.    It is certain that in the popular Icelandic saga of \"Howard the Halt\"  tradition has recorded with minute detail of approbation the story of  a man and woman, old, weak, friendless, who, in spite of terrible  odds, succeeded in obtaining a late but sufficing vengeance for the  cruel slaughter of their only son, the murderer being the most  powerful man of the region. The part here assigned to the woman  indicates the firm hold which the blood-feud had gained on the  imagination of the Norsemen.      Icelandic Ghosts    The story possesses"]]]
