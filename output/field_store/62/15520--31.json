To meet this requirement transformers have been devised, which will take  a current of very high voltage, and deliver a current of low tension,  and capable of being used anywhere with the ordinary motors.    THE TRANSFORMER.--This is an electrical device made up of a core or  cores of thin sheet metal, around which is wound sets of insulated  wires, one set being designed to receive the high voltage, and the other  set to put out the low voltage, as described in a former chapter.    These may be made where the original output is a very high voltage, so  that they will be stepped down, first from one voltage to a lower, and  then from that to the next lower stage. This is called the \"Step down\"  transformer, and is now used over the entire world, where large voltages  are generated.    ELECTRIC FURNACES.--The most important development of electricity in the  direction of heat is its use in furnaces. As before stated, an intense  heat is capable of being generated by the electric current, so that it  becomes the great agent to use for the treatment of refractory material.    In furnaces of this kind the electric arc is the mechanical form used to  produce the great heat, the only difference being in the size of the  apparatus. The electric furnace is simply an immense form of arc light,  capable of taking a high voltage, and such an arc is enclosed within a  suitable oven of refractory material, which still further conserves the  heat.    WELDING BY ELECTRICITY.--The next step is to use the high heat thus  capable of being produced, to fuse metals so that they may be welded  together. It is a difficult matter to unite two large pieces of metal by  the forging method, because the highest heat is required, owing to their  bulk, and in addition immense hammers, weighing tons, must be employed.    Electric welding offers a simple and easy method of accomplishing the  result, and in the doing of which it avoids the oxidizing action of the  forging heat. Instead of heating the pieces to be welded in a forge, as  is now done, the ends to be united are simply brought into contact, and  the current is sent through the ends until they are in a soft condition,  after which the parts are pressed together and united by the simple  merging of the plastic condition in which they are reduced by the high  electric heat.    This form of welding makes the most perfect joint, and requires no  hammering, as the mass of the metal flows from one part or end to the  other; the unity is a perfect one, and the advantage is that the metals  can be kept in a semi-fluid state for a considerable time, thus assuring  a perfect admixture of the two parts.    With the ordinary form of welding it is necessary to drive the heated  parts together without any delay, and at the least cooling must be  reheated, or the joint will not be perfect.    The smallest kinds of electric heating apparatus are now being made, so  that small articles, sheet metal, small rods, and like parts can be  united with the greatest facility.          CHAPTER XVIII    X-RAY, RADIUM, AND THE LIKE      The camera sees things invisible to the human eye. Its most effective  work is done with beams which are beyond human perception. The  photographer uses the _Actinic_ rays. Ordinary light is composed of the  seven primary colors, of which the lowest in the scale is the red, and  the highest to violet.    Those below the red are called the Infra-red, and they are the Hertzian  waves, or those used in wireless telegraphy. Those above the violet are  called Ultra-violet, and these are employed for X-ray work. The former  are produced by the high tension electric apparatus, which we have  described in the chapter relating to wireless telegraphy; and the  latter, called also the Roentgen rays, are generated by the Crookes'  Tube.    This is a tube from which all the atmosphere has been extracted so that  it is a practical vacuum. Within this are placed electrodes so as to  divert the action of the electrical discharge in a particular direction,  and this light, when discharged, is of such a peculiar character that  its discovery made a sensation in the scientific world.    The reason for this great wonder was not in the fact that it projected a  light, but because of its character. Ordinary light, as we see it with  the eye, is capable of being reflected, as when we look into a mirror at  an angle. The X-ray will not reflect, but instead, pass directly through  the glass.    Then, ordinary light is capable of refraction. This is shown by a ray of  light bending as it passes through a glass of water, which is noticed  when the light is at an angle to the surface.    The X-ray will pass through the water without being changed from a  straight line. The foregoing being the case, it was but a simple step to  conclude that if it were possible to find a means whereby the human eye  could see within the ultra-violet beam, it would be possible to see  through opaque substances.    From the discovery so important and far reaching it was not long until  it was found that if the ultra-violet rays, thus propagated, were  transmitted through certain substances, their rates of vibration would  be brought down to the speeds which send forth the visible rays, and now  the eye is able to see, in a measure at least, what the actinic rays  show.    This discovery was but the forerunner of a still more important  development, namely, the discovery of _radium_. The actual finding of  the metal was preceded by the knowledge that certain minerals, and  water, as well, possessed the property of radio-activity.    Radio-activity is a word used to express that quality in metals or other  material by means of which obscure rays are emitted, that have the  capacity of discharging electrified bodies, and the power to ionize  gases, as well as to actually affect photograph plates.    Certain metals had this property to a remarkable degree, particularly  uranium, thorium, polonium, actinium, and others, and in 1898 the  Curies, husband and wife, French chemists, isolated an element, very  ductile in its character, which was a white metal, and had a most  brilliant luster.    Pitchblende, the base metal from which this was extracted, was  discovered to be highly radio-active, and on making tests of the product  taken from it, they were surprised to find that it emitted a form of  energy that far exceeded in calculations any computations made on the  basis of radio-activity in the metals hitherto examined.    But this was not the most remarkable part of the developments. The  energy, whatever it was, had the power to change many other substances  if brought into close proximity. It darkens the color of diamonds,  quartz, mica, and glass. It changes some of the latter in color, some  kinds being turned to brown and others into violet or purple tinges.    Radium has the capacity to redden the skin, and affect the flesh of  persons, even at some considerable distance, and it is a most powerful  germicide, destroying bacteria, and has been found also to produce some  remarkable cures in diseases of a cancerous nature.    The remarkable similarity of the rays propagated by this substance, with  the X-rays, lead many to believe that they are electrical in their  character, and the whole scientific world is now striving to use this  substance, as well as the more familiar light waves of the Roentgen  tube, in the healing of diseases.    It is not at all remarkable that this use of it should first be  considered, as it has been the history of the electrical developments,  from the earliest times, that each successive stage should find  advocates who would urge its virtues to heal the sick.    It was so when the dynamo was invented, when the high tension current  was produced; and electrical therapeutics became a leading theme when  transmission by induction became recognized as a scientific fact.    It is not many years since the X-rays were discovered, and the first  announcement was concerning its wonderful healing powers.    This was particularly true in the case of radium, but for some reason,  after the first tests, all experimenters were thwarted in their  theories, because the science, like all others, required infinite  patience and experience. It was discovered, in the case of the X-ray,  that it must be used in a modified form, and accordingly, various  modifications of the waves were introduced, called the _m_ and the _n_  rays, as well as many others, each having some peculiar qualification.    In time, no doubt, the investigators will find the right quality for  each disease, and learn how to apply it. Thus, electricity, that most  alluring thing which, in itself, cannot be seen, and is of such a  character that it cannot even be defined in terms which will suit the  exact scientific mind, is daily bringing new wonders for our  investigation and use.    It is, indeed, a study which is so broad that it has no limitations, and  a field which never will be exhausted.

It will endure almost any amount of  forcing, by liquid manures or irrigation. It requires three or four  years, after soiling, to gain a firm footing in the soil. The seed is  covered with the soft and woolly husks of the flower, and is  consequently light; weighing but five pounds to the bushel, and  containing seventy-six thousand seeds to the ounce.    The ORCHARD GRASS, or ROUGH COCKSFOOT, for pastures, stands pre-eminent.  This is a native of this country, and was introduced into England, from  Virginia, in 1764, since which time its cultivation has extended into  every country of Europe, where it is universally held in very high  estimation. The fact of its being very palatable to stock of all kinds,  its rapid growth, and the luxuriance of its aftermath, with its power of  enduring the cropping of cattle, have given it a very high reputation,  especially as a pasture grass. It blossoms earlier than Timothy; when  green, is equally relished by milch cows; requires to be fed closer, to  prevent its forming tufts and growing up to seed, when it becomes hard  and wiry, and loses much of its nutritive quality. As it blossoms about  the same time, it forms an admirable mixture with red clover, either for  permanent pasture or mowing. It resists drought, and is less exhausting  to the soil than either rye grass or Timothy. The seed weighs twelve  pounds to the bushel, and when sown alone requires about two bushels to  the acre.    The ROUGH-STALKED MEADOW GRASS is somewhat less common than the June  grass, but is considered equally valuable. It grows best on moist,  sheltered meadows, where it flowers in June and July. It is readily  distinguished from June grass by its having a rough sheath, while the  latter has a smooth one, and by having a fibrous root, while the root of  the other is creeping. It possesses very considerable nutritive  qualities, and comes to perfection at a desirable time, and is  exceedingly relished by cattle, horses and sheep. For suitable soils it  should form a portion of a mixture of seeds, producing, in mixture with  other grasses which serve to shelter it, a large yield of hay, far above  the average of grass usually sown on a similar soil. It should be cut  when the seed is formed. Seven pounds of seed to the acre will make a  good sward. The grass loses about seventy per cent. of its weight in  drying. The nutritive qualities of its aftermath exceed very  considerably those of the crop cut in the flower or in the seed.    FOWL MEADOW GRASS is another indigenous species, of great value for low  and marshy grounds, where it flourishes best; and, if cut and properly  cured, makes a sweet and nutritious hay, which, from its fineness, is  eaten by cows without waste. According to Sinclair--who experimented,  with the aid of Sir Humphrey Davy, to ascertain its comparative  nutritive properties--it is superior in this respect to either meadow  foxtail, orchard grass, or tall meadow oat grass; but it is probable  that he somewhat overrates it. If allowed to stand till nearly ripe, it  falls down, but sends up innumerable flowering stems from the joints, so  that it continues green and luxuriant till late in the season. It  thrives best in mixture with other grasses, and deserves a prominent  place in all mixtures for rich, moist pastures, and low mowing-lands.    RYE GRASS has a far higher reputation abroad than in this country, and  probably with reason; for it is better adapted to a wet and uncertain  climate than to a dry and hot one. It varies exceedingly, depending much  on soil and culture; but, when cut in the blossom to make into hay, it  possesses very considerable nutritive power. If allowed to get too ripe,  it is hard and wiry, and not relished by cows. The change from a juicy  and nutritious plant to a woody fibre, containing but little soluble  matter, is very rapid. Properly managed, however, it is a tolerably good  grass, though not to be compared to Timothy, or orchard grass.    REDTOP is a grass familiar to every farmer in the country. It is the  Herd's grass of Pennsylvania, while in New York and New England it is  known by a great variety of names and assumes a great variety of forms,  according to the soil in which it grows. It is well adapted to almost  every soil, though it seems to prefer a moist loam. It makes a  profitable crop for spending, in the form of hay, though its yield is  less than that of Timothy. It is well suited to our permanent pastures,  where it should be fed close, otherwise it becomes wiry and  innutritious, and cattle refuse it. It stands the climate of the country  as well as any other grass, and so forms a valuable part of any mixture  for pastures and permanent mowing-lands; but it is, probably, rather  over rated by us.    ENGLISH BENT, known also by a number of other names, is largely  cultivated in some sections. It closely resembles redtop, but may be  distinguished from it by the roughness of the sheaths when the hand is  drawn from above downward. It possesses about the same qualities as  redtop.    MEADOW FESCUE is one of the most common of the fescue grasses, and is  said to be the Randall grass of Virginia. It is an excellent pasture  grass, forming a very considerable portion of the turf of old pasture  lands and fields; and is more extensively propagated and diffused from  the fact that it ripens its seeds before most other grasses are cut, and  sheds them to spring up and cover the ground. Its long and tender leaves  are much relished by cattle. It is rarely sown in this country,  notwithstanding its great and acknowledged value as a pasture grass. If  sown at all, it should be in mixture with other grasses, as orchard  grass, and rye grass, or June grass. It is of much greater value at the  time of flowering than when the seed is ripe.    [Illustration: A CHANCE FOR A SELECTION.]    THE TALL OAT GRASS is the Ray grass of France. It furnishes a luxuriant  supply of foliage, is valuable either for hay or for pasture, and has  been especially recommended for soiling purposes, on account of its  early and luxuriant growth. It is often found on the borders of fields  and hedges, woods and pastures, and is sometimes very plenty in  mowing-lands. After having been mown it shoots up a very thick  aftermath, and, on this account, partly, is regarded of nearly equal  excellence with the common foxtail.    It grows spontaneously on deep, sandy soils, when once naturalized. It  has been cultivated to a considerable extent in this country, and is  esteemed by those who know it mainly for its early, rapid, and late  growth, making it very well calculated as a permanent pasture grass. It  will succeed on tenacious clover soil.    The SWEET-SCENTED VERNAL GRASS is one of the earliest in spring and one  of the latest in autumn; and this habit of growth is one of its chief  excellencies, as it is neither a nutritious grass, nor very palatable to  stock of any kind, nor does it yield a very good crop. It is very common  in New England and all over the Middle States, coming into old worn-out  fields and moist pastures spontaneously, and along every roadside. It  derives its name from its sweetness of odor when partially wilted or  crushed in the hand, and it is this chiefly which gives the delicious  fragrance to all new-mown bay. It is almost the only grass that  possesses a strongly-marked aromatic odor, which is imparted to other  grasses with which it is cured. Its seed weighs eight pounds to the  bushel. In mixtures for permanent pastures it may be of some value.    HUNGARIAN GRASS, or millet, is an annual forage plant, introduced into  France in 1815, and more recently into this country. It germinates  readily, and withstands the drought remarkably, remaining green when  other grasses are parched and dried up. It has numerous succulent  leaves which furnish an abundance of sweet fodder, greatly relished by  stock of all kinds. It attains its greatest luxuriance on soils of  medium consistency and richness, but does very well on light and dry  plains.    RED CLOVER is an artificial grass of the leguminous family, and one of  the most valuable cultivated plants for feeding to dairy cows. It  flourishes best on tenacious soils and stiff loams. Its growth is rapid,  and a few months after sowing are sufficient to supply an abundant sweet  and nutritious food. In the climate of New England, clover should be  sown in the spring of the year, while most of the natural grasses do far  better when sown in the fall. It is often sown with perfect success on  the late snows of March or April, and soon finds its way down into the  soil and takes a vigorous hold with its root. It is valuable not only as  a forage plant, but as shading the ground, and thereby increasing its  fertility.    The introduction of clover among the cultivated plants of the farm has  done more, perhaps, for modern agriculture than that of any other single  plant. It is now considered indispensable in all good dairy districts.    WHITE CLOVER, often called Honeysuckle, is also widely diffused over  this country, to which it is undoubtedly indigenous. As a mixture in all  pasture grasses it holds a very high rank, as it is exceedingly sweet  and nutritious, and relished by all kinds of stock. It grows most  luxuriantly in moist grounds and moist seasons, but easily accommodates  itself to a great variety of circumstances.    With respect to the mixtures of grass-seeds most profitable for the  dairy farmer, no universal rule can be given, as they depend very much  upon the nature of the soil and the locality. The most important point  to be observed, and the one as to which, probably, the greatest  deficiency exists, is to use a large number of species, with smaller  quantities of each than those most commonly used. This is Nature's rule;  for, in examining the turf of a rich old pasture, a large number of  different species will be found"]]]
