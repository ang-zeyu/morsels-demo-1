The late Lord  Lieutenant had persuaded the officers of the garrison to swear that they  would not surrender Limerick till they should receive an answer to the  letter in which their situation had been explained to James. The Bishops  thought that the oath was no longer binding. It had been taken at a time  when the communications with France were open, and in the full belief  that the answer of James would arrive within three weeks. More than  twice that time had elapsed. Every avenue leading to the city was  strictly guarded by the enemy. His Majesty's faithful subjects, by  holding out till it had become impossible for him to signify his  pleasure to them, had acted up to the spirit of their promise. [124]    The next question was what terms should be demanded. A paper, containing  propositions which statesmen of our age will think reasonable, but which  to the most humane and liberal English Protestants of the seventeenth  century appeared extravagant, was sent to the camp of the besiegers.  What was asked was that all offences should be covered with oblivion,  that perfect freedom of worship should be allowed to the native  population, that every parish should have its priest, and that Irish  Roman Catholics should be capable of holding all offices, civil and  military, and of enjoying all municipal privileges. [125]    Ginkell knew little of the laws and feelings of the English; but he  had about him persons who were competent to direct him. They had a week  before prevented him from breaking a Rapparee on the wheel; and they now  suggested an answer to the propositions of the enemy. \"I am a stranger  here,\" said Ginkell; \"I am ignorant of the constitution of these  kingdoms; but I am assured that what you ask is inconsistent with  that constitution; and therefore I cannot with honour consent.\" He  immediately ordered a new battery to be thrown up, and guns and mortars  to be planted on it. But his preparations were speedily interrupted by  another message from the city. The Irish begged that, since he could not  grant what they had demanded, he would tell them what he was willing to  grant. He called his advisers round him, and, after some consultation,  sent back a paper containing the heads of a treaty, such as he had  reason to believe that the government which he served would approve.  What he offered was indeed much less than what the Irish desired, but  was quite as much as, when they considered their situation and the  temper of the English nation, they could expect. They speedily notified  their assent. It was agreed that there should be a cessation of arms,  not only by land, but in the ports and bays of Munster, and that a fleet  of French transports should be suffered to come up the Shannon in peace  and to depart in peace. The signing of the treaty was deferred till  the Lords justices, who represented William at Dublin, should arrive  at Ginkell's quarters. But there was during some days a relaxation of  military vigilance on both sides. Prisoners were set at liberty. The  outposts of the two armies chatted and messed together. The English  officers rambled into the town. The Irish officers dined in the camp.  Anecdotes of what passed at the friendly meetings of these men, who had  so lately been mortal enemies, were widely circulated. One story, in  particular, was repeated in every part of Europe. \"Has not this last  campaign,\" said Sarsfield to some English officers, \"raised your opinion  of Irish soldiers?\" \"To tell you the truth,\" answered an Englishman, \"we  think of them much as we always did.\" \"However meanly you may think of  us,\" replied Sarsfield, \"change Kings with us, and we will willingly try  our luck with you again.\" He was doubtless thinking of the day on which  he had seen the two Sovereigns at the head of two great armies, William  foremost in the charge, and James foremost in the flight. [126]    On the first of October, Coningsby and Porter arrived at the English  headquarters. On the second the articles of capitulation were discussed  at great length and definitely settled. On the third they were signed.  They were divided into two parts, a military treaty and a civil treaty.  The former was subscribed only by the generals on both sides. The Lords  justices set their names to the latter. [127]    By the military treaty it was agreed that such Irish officers and  soldiers as should declare that they wished to go to France should be  conveyed thither, and should, in the meantime, remain under the command  of their own generals. Ginkell undertook to furnish a considerable  number of transports. French vessels were also to be permitted to pass  and repass freely between Britanny and Munster. Part of Limerick was to  be immediately delivered up to the English. But the island on which the  Cathedral and the Castle stand was to remain, for the present, in the  keeping of the Irish.    The terms of the civil treaty were very different from those which  Ginkell had sternly refused to grant. It was not stipulated that the  Roman Catholics of Ireland should be competent to hold any political or  military office, or that they should be admitted into any corporation.  But they obtained a promise that they should enjoy such privileges in  the exercise of their religion as were consistent with the law, or as  they had enjoyed in the reign of Charles the Second.    To all inhabitants of Limerick, and to all officers and soldiers in  the Jacobite army, who should submit to the government and notify their  submission by taking the oath of allegiance, an entire amnesty was  promised. They were to retain their property; they were to be allowed  to exercise any profession which they had exercised before the troubles;  they were not to be punished for any treason, felony, or misdemeanour  committed since the accession of the late King; nay, they were not to  be sued for damages on account of any act of spoliation or outrage which  they might have committed during the three years of confusion. This was  more than the Lords justices were constitutionally competent to  grant. It was therefore added that the government would use its utmost  endeavours to obtain a Parliamentary ratification of the treaty. [128]    As soon as the two instruments had been signed, the English entered the  city, and occupied one quarter of it. A narrow, but deep branch of  the Shannon separated them from the quarter which was still in the  possession of the Irish. [129]    In a few hours a dispute arose which seemed likely to produce a renewal  of hostilities. Sarsfield had resolved to seek his fortune in the  service of France, and was naturally desirous to carry with him to the  Continent such a body of troops as would be an important addition to the  army of Lewis. Ginkell was as naturally unwilling to send thousands  of men to swell the forces of the enemy. Both generals appealed to the  treaty. Each construed it as suited his purpose, and each complained  that the other had violated it. Sarsfield was accused of putting one of  his officers under arrest for refusing to go to the Continent. Ginkell,  greatly excited, declared that he would teach the Irish to play tricks  with him, and began to make preparations for a cannonade. Sarsfield  came to the English camp, and tried to justify what he had done. The  altercation was sharp. \"I submit,\" said Sarsfield, at last: \"I am in  your power.\" \"Not at all in my power,\" said Ginkell, \"go back and do  your worst.\" The imprisoned officer was liberated; a sanguinary contest  was averted; and the two commanders contented themselves with a war of  words. [130] Ginkell put forth proclamations assuring the Irish that, if  they would live quietly in their own land, they should be protected and  favoured, and that if they preferred a military life, they should be  admitted into the service of King William. It was added that no man,  who chose to reject this gracious invitation and to become a soldier of  Lewis, must expect ever again to set foot on the island. Sarsfield and  Wauchop exerted their eloquence on the other side. The present aspect  of affairs, they said, was doubtless gloomy; but there was bright sky  beyond the cloud. The banishment would be short. The return would be  triumphant. Within a year the French would invade England. In such  an invasion the Irish troops, if only they remained unbroken, would  assuredly bear a chief part. In the meantime it was far better for them  to live in a neighbouring and friendly country, under the parental care  of their own rightful King, than to trust the Prince of Orange, who  would probably send them to the other end of the world to fight for his  ally the Emperor against the Janissaries.    The help of the Roman Catholic clergy was called in. On the day on  which those who had made up their minds to go to France were required  to announce their determination, the priests were indefatigable in  exhorting. At the head of every regiment a sermon was preached on the  duty of adhering to the cause of the Church, and on the sin and danger  of consorting with unbelievers. [131] Whoever, it was said, should enter  the service of the usurpers would do so at the peril of his soul. The  heretics affirmed that, after the peroration, a plentiful allowance of  brandy was served out to the audience, and that, when the brandy had  been swallowed, a Bishop pronounced a benediction. Thus duly prepared  by physical and moral stimulants, the garrison, consisting of about  fourteen thousand infantry, was drawn up in the vast meadow which lay  on the Clare bank of the Shannon. Here copies of Ginkell's proclamation  were profusely scattered about; and English officers went through the  ranks imploring the men not to ruin themselves, and explaining to them  the advantages which the soldiers of King William enjoyed. At length the  decisive moment came. The troops were ordered to pass in review.  Those who"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26196"],[0,"The International Magazine, Volume 2, No. 3, February, 1851 (#20)"],[1,"speak to them of the sea-serpent, but no  one dares to evince the least skepticism touching the new opera of  Rossini. We received this morning a letter from our correspondent at  Bologna, and he furnishes us with details which explain the  announcements in the newspapers.    \"Rossini is living in rather a retired way just now; and only receives  the regular visits of one person; there is an error, however, in the  orthography of the appellation of this visitor. Instead of Donzelli, he  is named Pastafrollo. He is no tenor! he is a cook! Rossini, in company  with Pastafrollo, is now busily occupied in endeavoring to discover a  new way of dressing turbot. Rossini has invented, up to the present day,  sixty-two different ways of dressing this fish, but he repeats to  whoever will listen to him, that he will not die content until he has  discovered a sixty-third method, which will satisfy him completely--then  he will divulge his secret, and have inscribed on the _cartes_ of all  the _restaurants_ in Europe--_turbot a la Rossini_. On that day, but  that day only, Rossini will make up his mind to open his piano and  compose a _cantata_ in honor of fish in general, and turbot in  particular. The passion of Rossini for cooking has been rendered more  ardent from the fact that the family of this illustrious personage do  all they can to cross him in it. The relatives and friends of Rossini  wish to make him believe that it is unworthy of a musician, and more  especially of a musician of his genius, to occupy himself with turbot;  but Rossini replies, history in hand, that a whole senate once devoted a  long sitting to find out what sauce would eat best with this fish.  Rossini's family do not consider themselves beaten as yet, and they have  organized a sort of _cordon sanitaire_ round the house of the composer,  to prevent the cooks from getting to him. Before this determination was  arrived at, Bologna overflowed with _chefs_, who arrived from every part  of Italy, to consult Rossini on the best methods to be employed in  dressing salmon, skate, carp, eels, and gudgeons.    \"This furnishes us with an explanation of the reason why Pastafrollo was  forced to employ a stratagem in order to prevent his being stopped in  the hall by the family of Rossini. Pastafrollo arrived at Bologna, under  the name of Donzelli, and took care to have inscribed on his passport  _tenor_ instead of _cook_.    \"We cannot conclude without giving expression to an earnest hope, that  the conferences established between Rossini and Pastafrollo may give  birth to the sixty-third mode of dressing turbot.\"          THE FIRST PEACE SOCIETY.      In an entertaining article on \"The Abbe de Saint-Pierre,\" in the last  _Gentleman's Magazine_, there is this curious account of a \"Peace  Society.\"    \"The Abbe de Polignac took Saint Pierre with him to the Congress of  Utrecht. Witnessing all the difficulties which stood in the way of  reconciliation between the contending parties, Saint-Pierre conceived  that the truest benefit which could be conferred on mankind would be the  abolition of war. He at once proceeded to embody his idea, and published  in 1713, the year in which peace was concluded, his 'Projet de Paix  Perpetuelle,' in three volumes. The means by which he proposed that this  perpetual peace should be preserved was the formation of a senate to be  composed of all nations, and to be called _The European Diet_, and  before which princes should be bound to state their grievances and  demand redress. The Bishop of Frejus, afterwards Cardinal de Fleury, to  whom Saint-Pierre communicated his plan, replied to him, 'You have  forgotten the most essential article, that of sending forth a troop of  missionaries to persuade the hearts of princes, and induce them to adopt  your views.' D'Alembert has made one or two just remarks on  Saint-Pierre's dream of universal peace, which are as applicable now as  they were a hundred years ago: 'The misfortune of those metaphysical  projects for the benefit of nations consists in supposing all princes  equitable and moderate, in attributing to men whose power is absolute,  and who have the perfect consciousness of their power, who are often  exceedingly unenlightened, and who live always in an atmosphere of  adulation and falsehood, dispositions which the force of law and the  fear of censure so rarely inspire even in private persons. Whosoever, in  forming enterprises for the happiness of humanity, does not take into  calculation the passions and vices of men, has imagined only a beautiful  chimera.' Rousseau thought that, even if Saint Pierre's project were  practicable, it would cause more evil all at once than it would prevent  during many ages.\"    The writer of this memoir of Saint Pierre presents the character of that  remarkable person in a more favorable light than that in which we have  been accustomed to regard it. The author of \"Paul and Virginia\" was very  likely a far better man than has been supposed.          EGYPT UNDER THE PHARAOHS.    MR. KENRICK'S HISTORY.[15]      All nations turn to Egypt, as to the mother of civility, and the  Christian sees there the prison where are detained, until the end of the  world, the witnesses of truths which vindicate his religion. How much  the Holy Land is our country, appears from this, that to all Christians,  however remote the places where they live, the scenes about Jerusalem  are more familiar than those about the capital of his own nation; and  with Egypt we are scarcely less intimately, though much less perfectly,  acquainted. Within the last half century, great researches have been  made, by individual or national enterprise, into the poetry and  antiquities of Egypt, by the enterprise of travellers and the diligence  of archaeologists, among whom England claims the names of Young,  Wilkinson, and Vyse. But comparatively few know what has been the result  of these researches. They lie scattered over a number of works in  different languages, beyond the reach even of the ordinary student, much  more of the general reader. Mr. Kenrick (of whose \"Ancient Egypt under  the Pharaohs\" we copy below the main portion of a reviewal in the London  _Times_) has undertaken the task of supplying a synopsis, and this task  he appears to us to have accomplished excellently well. Mr. Kenrick is a  very estimable as well as a very accomplished man. Like the great  majority of the abler historical, philosophical and religious writers of  England at this time, he is a _Dissenter_, which perhaps lessens  somewhat the warmth of the critic's commendations. We hope to see his  work, as well as that of Mr. Sharpe, relating to Egypt under the  Ptolemies, reproduced, by some of our own publishers. Of Mr. Kenrick,  the _Times_ says:--    \"He commences with the land of Egypt. In the East great rivers are the  parents of civilized nations. A great river, which by its deposit forms  a long valley and a broad delta of rich alluvial soil in the midst of  deserts, was the parent, the nourisher, and the god of the oldest  civilized nation of the earth. The Nile is Egypt; the Egyptians were  those who lived below the cataracts and drank of the Nile. Above the  cataracts they pushed their arms into Ethiopia, and left there the  monuments of their dominion. To the west they were at once defended and  confined by a desert impassable to armies, but which the oasis rendered  passable to the caravan. On the north was an almost harborless sea. On  the east was another desert, through which roads led to the ports of the  Red Sea and the mines of Sinai. On the north-east the Arabian desert  formed an imperfect barrier. It was traversed by the hosts of Sesostris  and Sheshonk, of Nebuchadnezzar and Cambyses, and across its sands Egypt  communicated commercially and politically with the other seats of  ancient civilization which, broken by the recurring desert, formed an  irregular chain from Philistia to China.    \"Of the singular productions of Egypt, the hippopotamus, the crocodile,  the ibis, the papyrus, we need not speak. There were few beasts of  chase, and the Egyptian conquerors did not begin like those of central  Asia by being mighty hunters. It was a land of corn, and of the vine, of  fruit trees, and all herbs. The nations sought its granaries in famine;  the Israelites in the wilderness thirsted for the cooling vegetables of  its gardens. Fish abounded in the Nile, waterfowl in the marshes. Nature  yielded freely, but perhaps for that very reason the mind of man was  less exercised and less active. And the unvarying landscape, the  unchanging sky, the small number and unpoetic or even grotesque forms of  the plants and animals, may partly account for the lack of imagination  evinced by the most formal and most stationary of nations, scarcely  excepting the Chinese.    \"Who and whence were the Egyptians? This question Mr. Kenrick has to  ask, and, like others, to leave unanswered. This is the secret which the  grave of the Pharaohs will not yield. Physiology supplies no clue. The  mummy cases, the paintings and sculptures, depict a race short, slight,  with low foreheads, high cheek bones, long eyes, hair now crisp now  curled, and a complexion which the conventionality of the painter's art  makes to differ in men and women, but which probably was brown with a  tinge of red, dark compared with that of the Syrian, black compared with  that of the Greek. Thick lips are frequently seen, but they are supposed  to indicate intermarriage with Ethiopians. From the negro the Egyptians  were far removed, nor can they be connected with any other known race.  If we turn to language, a surer guide perhaps than physiology, we are  again completely baffled. The Coptic has been identified through many  etymologies with the old Egyptian; and of the Coptic, though it became a  dead language in the twelfth century, much literature remains. It is an  uncultivated and formal tongue,"]]]
