It will prove of an inestimable advantage to students,  being, in my humble estimation, one of the clearest and most practical  treatises on the subject which contemporary literature has produced.  Accept also my sincere thanks for the description contained in your work  of the origin of the laryngoscope, and believe me,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3095"],[0,"The Lady of the Shroud (#20)"],[1,"s,  appeared ghost-like in the fitful moonlight.  The many vases and statues  and urns, always like phantoms in a half-light, were more than ever  weird.  Last night the moonlight was unusually effective, and showed not  only the gardens down to the defending wall, but the deep gloom of the  great forest-trees beyond; and beyond that, again, to where the mountain  chain began, the forest running up their silvered slopes flamelike in  form, deviated here and there by great crags and the outcropping rocky  sinews of the vast mountains.    Whilst I was looking at this lovely prospect, I thought I saw something  white flit, like a modified white flash, at odd moments from one to  another of the shrubs or statues--anything which would afford cover from  observation.  At first I was not sure whether I really saw anything or  did not.  This was in itself a little disturbing to me, for I have been  so long trained to minute observation of facts surrounding me, on which  often depend not only my own life, but the lives of others, that I have  become accustomed to trust my eyes; and anything creating the faintest  doubt in this respect is a cause of more or less anxiety to me.  Now,  however, that my attention was called to myself, I looked more keenly,  and in a very short time was satisfied that something was  moving--something clad in white.  It was natural enough that my thoughts  should tend towards something uncanny--the belief that this place is  haunted, conveyed in a thousand ways of speech and inference.  Aunt  Janet's eerie beliefs, fortified by her books on occult subjects--and of  late, in our isolation from the rest of the world, the subject of daily  conversations--helped to this end.  No wonder, then, that, fully awake  and with senses all on edge, I waited for some further manifestation from  this ghostly visitor--as in my mind I took it to be.  It must surely be a  ghost or spiritual manifestation of some kind which moved in this silent  way.  In order to see and hear better, I softly moved back the folding  grille, opened the French window, and stepped out, bare-footed and  pyjama-clad as I was, on the marble terrace.  How cold the wet marble  was!  How heavy smelled the rain-laden garden!  It was as though the  night and the damp, and even the moonlight, were drawing the aroma from  all the flowers that blossomed.  The whole night seemed to exhale heavy,  half-intoxicating odours!  I stood at the head of the marble steps, and  all immediately before me was ghostly in the extreme--the white marble  terrace and steps, the white walks of quartz-sand glistening under the  fitful moonlight; the shrubs of white or pale green or yellow,--all  looking dim and ghostly in the glamorous light; the white statues and  vases.  And amongst them, still flitting noiselessly, that mysterious  elusive figure which I could not say was based on fact or imagination.  I  held my breath, listening intently for every sound; but sound there was  none, save those of the night and its denizens.  Owls hooted in the  forest; bats, taking advantage of the cessation of the rain, flitted  about silently, like shadows in the air.  But there was no more sign of  moving ghost or phantom, or whatever I had seen might have been--if,  indeed, there had been anything except imagination.    So, after waiting awhile, I returned to my room, closed the window, drew  the grille across again, and dragged the heavy curtain before the  opening; then, having extinguished my candles, went to bed in the dark.  In a few minutes I must have been asleep.    \"What was that?\"  I almost heard the words of my own thought as I sat up  in bed wide awake.  To memory rather than present hearing the disturbing  sound had seemed like the faint tapping at the window.  For some seconds  I listened, mechanically but intently, with bated breath and that quick  beating of the heart which in a timorous person speaks for fear, and for  expectation in another.  In the stillness the sound came again--this time  a very, very faint but unmistakable tapping at the glass door.    I jumped up, drew back the curtain, and for a moment stood appalled.    There, outside on the balcony, in the now brilliant moonlight, stood a  woman, wrapped in white grave-clothes saturated with water, which dripped  on the marble floor, making a pool which trickled slowly down the wet  steps.  Attitude and dress and circumstance all conveyed the idea that,  though she moved and spoke, she was not quick, but dead.  She was young  and very beautiful, but pale, like the grey pallor of death.  Through the  still white of her face, which made her look as cold as the wet marble  she stood on, her dark eyes seemed to gleam with a strange but enticing  lustre.  Even in the unsearching moonlight, which is after all rather  deceptive than illuminative, I could not but notice one rare quality of  her eyes.  Each had some quality of refraction which made it look as  though it contained a star.  At every movement she made, the stars  exhibited new beauties, of more rare and radiant force.  She looked at me  imploringly as the heavy curtain rolled back, and in eloquent gestures  implored me to admit her.  Instinctively I obeyed; I rolled back the  steel grille, and threw open the French window.  I noticed that she  shivered and trembled as the glass door fell open.  Indeed, she seemed so  overcome with cold as to seem almost unable to move.  In the sense of her  helplessness all idea of the strangeness of the situation entirely  disappeared.  It was not as if my first idea of death taken from her  cerements was negatived.  It was simply that I did not think of it at  all; I was content to accept things as they were--she was a woman, and in  some dreadful trouble; that was enough.    I am thus particular about my own emotions, as I may have to refer to  them again in matters of comprehension or comparison.  The whole thing is  so vastly strange and abnormal that the least thing may afterwards give  some guiding light or clue to something otherwise not understandable.  I  have always found that in recondite matters first impressions are of more  real value than later conclusions.  We humans place far too little  reliance on instinct as against reason; and yet instinct is the great  gift of Nature to all animals for their protection and the fulfilment of  their functions generally.    When I stepped out on the balcony, not thinking of my costume, I found  that the woman was benumbed and hardly able to move.  Even when I asked  her to enter, and supplemented my words with gestures in case she should  not understand my language, she stood stock-still, only rocking slightly  to and fro as though she had just strength enough left to balance herself  on her feet.  I was afraid, from the condition in which she was, that she  might drop down dead at any moment.  So I took her by the hand to lead  her in.  But she seemed too weak to even make the attempt.  When I pulled  her slightly forward, thinking to help her, she tottered, and would have  fallen had I not caught her in my arms.  Then, half lifting her, I moved  her forwards.  Her feet, relieved of her weight, now seemed able to make  the necessary effort; and so, I almost carrying her, we moved into the  room.  She was at the very end of her strength; I had to lift her over  the sill.  In obedience to her motion, I closed the French window and  bolted it.  I supposed the warmth of the room--though cool, it was warmer  than the damp air without--affected her quickly, for on the instant she  seemed to begin to recover herself.  In a few seconds, as though she had  reacquired her strength, she herself pulled the heavy curtain across the  window.  This left us in darkness, through which I heard her say in  English:    \"Light.  Get a light!\"    I found matches, and at once lit a candle.  As the wick flared, she moved  over to the door of the room, and tried if the lock and bolt were  fastened.  Satisfied as to this, she moved towards me, her wet shroud  leaving a trail of moisture on the green carpet.  By this time the wax of  the candle had melted sufficiently to let me see her clearly.  She was  shaking and quivering as though in an ague; she drew the wet shroud  around her piteously.  Instinctively I spoke:    \"Can I do anything for you?\"    She answered, still in English, and in a voice of thrilling, almost  piercing sweetness, which seemed somehow to go straight to my heart, and  affected me strangely: \"Give me warmth.\"    I hurried to the fireplace.  It was empty; there was no fire laid.  I  turned to her, and said:    \"Wait just a few minutes here.  I shall call someone, and get help--and  fire.\"    Her voice seemed to ring with intensity as she answered without a pause:    \"No, no!  Rather would I be\"--here she hesitated for an instant, but as  she caught sight of her cerements went on hurriedly--\"as I am.  I trust  you--not others; and you must not betray my trust.\"  Almost instantly she  fell into a frightful fit of shivering, drawing again her death-clothes  close to her, so piteously that it wrung my heart.  I suppose I am a  practical man.  At any rate, I am accustomed to action.  I took from its  place beside my bed a thick Jaeger dressing-gown of dark brown--it was,  of course, of extra length--and held it out to her as I said:    \"Put that on.  It is the only warm thing here which would be suitable.  Stay; you must remove that wet--wet\"--I stumbled about for a word that  would not be offensive--\"that frock--dress--costume--whatever it is.\"  I  pointed to where, in the corner of the room, stood a chintz-covered  folding-screen which fences in my cold sponge bath, which is laid ready  for me overnight, as I am an early riser.    She bowed gravely, and taking the dressing-gown in a long, white,  finely-shaped hand, bore it behind the screen.  There was a slight  rustle, and then a hollow \"flop\" as the wet garment fell on the floor;  more rustling"]]]
