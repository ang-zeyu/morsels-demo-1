There to the reverend reverence pay,  And kill the foes who check thy way;  Then turn successful home and see  My sacrifice complete through thee.\"      Obedient to the high-souled lord  Grasped Ansuman his bow and sword,  And hurried forth the way to trace  With youth and valour's eager pace.  On sped he by the path he found  Dug by his uncles underground.  The warder elephant he saw  Whose size and strength pass Nature's law,  Who bears the world's tremendous weight,  Whom God, fiend, giant venerate,  Bird, serpent, and each flitting shade,  To him the honour meet he paid  With circling steps and greeting due,  And further prayed him, if he knew,  To tell him of his uncles' weal,  And who had dared the horse to steal.  To him in war and council tried  The warder elephant replied:  \"Thou, son of Asamanj, shalt lead  In triumph back the rescued steed.\"      As to each warder beast he came  And questioned all, his words the same,  The honoured youth with gentle speech  Drew eloquent reply from each,  That fortune should his steps attend,  And with the horse he home should wend.  Cheered with the grateful answer, he  Passed on with step more light and free,  And reached with careless heart the place  Where lay in ashes Sagar's race.  Then sank the spirit of the chief  Beneath that shock of sudden grief,  And with a bitter cry of woe  He mourned his kinsmen fallen so.  He saw, weighed down by woe and care,  The victim charger roaming there.  Yet would the pious chieftain fain  Oblations offer to the slain:  But, needing water for the rite,  He looked and there was none in sight  His quick eye searching all around  The uncle of his kinsmen found,  King Garud, best beyond compare  Of birds who wing the fields of air.  Then thus unto the weeping man  The son of Vinata(192) began:  \"Grieve not, O hero, for their fall  Who died a death approved of all.  Of mighty strength, they met their fate  By Kapil's hand whom none can mate.  Pour forth for them no earthly wave,  A holier flood their spirits crave.  If, daughter of the Lord of Snow,  Ganga would turn her stream below,  Her waves that cleanse all mortal stain  Would wash their ashes pure again.  Yea, when her flood whom all revere  Rolls o'er the dust that moulders here,  The sixty thousand, freed from sin,  A home in Indra's heaven shall win.  Go, and with ceaseless labour try  To draw the Goddess from the sky.  Return, and with thee take the steed;  So shall thy grandsire's rite succeed.\"      Prince Ansuman the strong and brave  Followed the rede Suparna(193) gave.  The glorious hero took the horse,  And homeward quickly bent his course.  Straight to the anxious king he hied,  Whom lustral rites had purified,  The mournful story to unfold  And all the king of birds had told.  The tale of woe the monarch heard,  Nor longer was the rite deferred:  With care and just observance he  Accomplished all, as texts decree.  The rites performed, with brighter fame,  Mighty in counsel, home he came.  He longed to bring the river down,  But found no plan his wish to crown.  He pondered long with anxious thought  But saw no way to what he sought.  Thus thirty thousand years he spent,  And then to heaven the monarch went.          Canto XLIII. Bhagirath.      When Sagar thus had bowed to fate,  The lords and commons of the state  Approved with ready heart and will  Prince Ansuman his throne to fill.  He ruled, a mighty king, unblamed,  Sire of Dilipa justly famed.  To him, his child and worthy heir,  The king resigned his kingdom's care,  And on Himalaya's pleasant side  His task austere of penance plied.  Bright as a God in clear renown  He planned to bring pure Ganga down.  There on his fruitless hope intent  Twice sixteen thousand years he spent,  And in the grove of hermits stayed  Till bliss in heaven his rites repaid.  Dilipa then, the good and great,  Soon as he learnt his kinsmen's fate,  Bowed down by woe, with troubled mind,  Pondering long no cure could find.  \"How can I bring,\" the mourner sighed,  \"To cleanse their dust, the heavenly tide?  How can I give them rest, and save  Their spirits with the offered wave?\"  Long with this thought his bosom skilled  In holy discipline was filled.  A son was born, Bhagirath named,  Above all men for virtue famed.  Dilipa many a rite ordained,  And thirty thousand seasons reigned.  But when no hope the king could see  His kinsmen from their woe to free,  The lord of men, by sickness tried,  Obeyed the law of fate, and died;  He left the kingdom to his son,  And gained the heaven his deeds had won.  The good Bhagirath, royal sage,  Had no fair son to cheer his age.  He, great in glory, pure in will,  Longing for sons was childless still.  Then on one wish, one thought intent,  Planning the heavenly stream's descent,  Leaving his ministers the care  And burden of his state to bear,  Dwelling in far Gokarna(194) he  Engaged in long austerity.  With senses checked, with arms upraised,  Five fires(195) around and o'er him blazed.  Each weary month the hermit passed  Breaking but once his awful fast.  In winter's chill the brook his bed,  In rain, the clouds to screen his head.  Thousands of years he thus endured  Till Brahma's favour was assured,  And the high Lord of living things  Looked kindly on his sufferings.  With trooping Gods the Sire came near  The king who plied his task austere:  \"Blest Monarch, of a glorious race,  Thy fervent rites have won my grace.  Well hast thou wrought thine awful task:  Some boon in turn, O Hermit, ask.\"      Bhagirath, rich in glory's light,  The hero with the arm of might,  Thus to the Lord of earth and sky  Raised suppliant hands and made reply:  \"If the great God his favour deigns,  And my long toil its fruit obtains,  Let Sagar's sons receive from me  Libations that they long to see.  Let Ganga with her holy wave  The ashes of the heroes lave,  That so my kinsmen may ascend  To heavenly bliss that ne'er shall end.  And give, I pray, O God, a son,  Nor let my house be all undone.  Sire of the worlds! be this the grace  Bestowed upon Ikshvaku's race.\"      The Sire, when thus the king had prayed,  In sweet kind words his answer made.  \"High, high thy thought and wishes are,  Bhagirath of the mighty car!  Ikshvaku's line is blest in thee,  And as thou prayest it shall be.  Ganga, whose waves in Swarga(196) flow,  Is daughter of the Lord of Snow.  Win Siva that his aid be lent  To hold her in her mid descent,  For earth alone will never bear  Those torrents hurled from upper air;  And none may hold her weight but He,  The Trident wielding deity.\"  Thus having said, the Lord supreme  Addressed him to the heavenly stream;  And then with Gods and Maruts(197) went  To heaven above the firmament.          Canto XLIV. The Descent Of Ganga.      The Lord of life the skies regained:  The fervent king a year remained  With arms upraised, refusing rest  While with one toe the earth he pressed,  Still as a post, with sleepless eye,  The air his food, his roof the sky.  The year had past. Then Uma's lord,(198)  King of creation, world adored,  Thus spoke to great Bhagirath: \"I,  Well pleased thy wish will gratify,  And on my head her waves shall fling  The daughter of the Mountains' King!\"    He stood upon the lofty crest    That crowns the Lord of Snow,  And bade the river of the Blest    Descend on earth below.  Himalaya's child, adored of all,    The haughty mandate heard,  And her proud bosom, at the call,    With furious wrath was stirred.  Down from her channel in the skies    With awful might she sped  With a giant's rush, in a giant's size,    On Siva's holy head.  \"He calls me,\" in her wrath she cried,    \"And all my flood shall sweep  And whirl him in its whelming tide    To hell's profoundest deep.\"  He held the river on his head,    And kept her wandering, where,  Dense as Himalaya's woods, were spread    The tangles of his hair.  No way to earth she found, ashamed,    Though long and sore she strove,  Condemned, until her pride were tamed,    Amid his locks to rove.  There, many lengthening seasons through,    The wildered river ran:  Bhagirath saw it, and anew    His penance dire began.  Then Siva, for the hermit's sake,    Bade her long wanderings end,  And sinking into Vindu's lake    Her weary waves descend.  From Ganga, by the God set free,    Seven noble rivers came;  Hladini, Pavani, and she    Called Nalini by name:  These rolled their lucid waves along    And sought the eastern side.  Suchakshu, Sita fair and strong,    And Sindhu's mighty tide--(199)  These to the region of the west    With joyful waters sped:  The seventh, the brightest and the best,    Flowed where Bhagirath led.  On Siva's head descending first    A rest the torrents found:  Then down in all their might they burst    And roared along the ground.  On countless glittering scales the beam    Of rosy morning flashed,  Where fish and dolphins through the stream    Fallen and falling dashed.  Then bards who chant celestial lays    And nymphs of heavenly birth  Flocked round upon that flood to gaze    That streamed from sky to earth.  The Gods themselves from every sphere,    Incomparably bright,  Borne in their golden cars drew near    To see the wondrous sight.  The cloudless sky was all aflame    With the light of a hundred suns  Where'er the shining chariots came    That bore those holy ones.  So flashed the air with crested snakes    And fish of every hue  As when the lightning's glory breaks    Through fields of summer blue.  And white foam-clouds and silver spray    Were wildly tossed on high,  Like swans that urge their homeward way    Across the autumn sky.  Now ran the river calm and clear    With current strong and deep:  Now slowly broadened to a mere,    Or scarcely seemed to creep.  Now o'er a length of sandy plain    Her tranquil course she held;  Now rose her waves and sank again,    By refluent waves repelled.

If the Hills  are going to take her up we'll have to be nice to her.\"    \"I suppose,\" said Edna conclusively, \"the truth of the matter is that  Sid Hill meant to ask her anyway. I dare say he asked her long ago,  and she would know our invitation was a fraud. So the joke is on  ourselves, after all.\"    But, as you and I know, that, with the exception of the last sentence,  was not the truth of the matter at all.          The Penningtons' Girl      Winslow had been fishing--or pretending to--all the morning, and he  was desperately thirsty. He boarded with the Beckwiths on the  Riverside East Shore, but he was nearer Riverside West, and he knew  the Penningtons well. He had often been there for bait and milk and  had listened times out of mind to Mrs. Pennington's dismal tales of  her tribulations with hired girls. She never could get along with  them, and they left, on an average, after a fortnight's trial. She was  on the lookout for one now, he knew, and would likely be cross, but he  thought she would give him a drink.    He rowed his skiff into the shore and tied it to a fir that hung out  from the bank. A winding little footpath led up to the Pennington  farmhouse, which crested the hill about three hundred yards from the  shore. Winslow made for the kitchen door and came face to face with a  girl carrying a pail of water--Mrs. Pennington's latest thing in hired  girls, of course.    Winslow's first bewildered thought was \"What a goddess!\" and he  wondered, as he politely asked for a drink, where on earth Mrs.  Pennington had picked her up. She handed him a shining dipper half  full and stood, pail in hand, while he drank it.    She was rather tall, and wore a somewhat limp, faded print gown, and a  big sunhat, beneath which a glossy knot of chestnut showed itself. Her  skin was very fair, somewhat freckled, and her mouth was delicious. As  for her eyes, they were grey, but beyond that simply defied  description.    \"Will you have some more?\" she asked in a soft, drawling voice.    \"No, thank you. That was delicious. Is Mrs. Pennington home?\"    \"No. She has gone away for the day.\"    \"Well, I suppose I can sit down here and rest a while. You've no  serious objections, have you?\"    \"Oh, no.\"    She carried her pail into the kitchen and came out again presently  with a knife and a pan of apples. Sitting down on a bench under the  poplars she proceeded to peel them with a disregard of his presence  that piqued Winslow, who was not used to being ignored in this  fashion. Besides, as a general rule, he had been quite good friends  with Mrs. Pennington's hired girls. She had had three strapping  damsels during his sojourn in Riverside, and he used to sit on this  very doorstep and chaff them. They had all been saucy and talkative.  This girl was evidently a new species.    \"Do you think you'll get along with Mrs. Pennington?\" he asked  finally. \"As a rule she fights with her help, although she is a most  estimable woman.\"    The girl smiled quite broadly.    \"I guess p'r'aps she's rather hard to suit,\" was the answer, \"but I  like her pretty well so far. I think we'll get along with each other.  If we don't I can leave--like the others did.\"    \"What is your name?\"    \"Nelly Ray.\"    \"Well, Nelly, I hope you'll be able to keep your place. Let me give  you a bit of friendly advice. Don't let the cats get into the pantry.  That is what Mrs. Pennington has quarrelled with nearly every one of  her girls about.\"    \"It is quite a bother to keep them out, ain't it?\" said Nelly calmly.  \"There's dozens of cats about the place. What on earth makes them keep  so many?\"    \"Mr. Pennington has a mania for cats. He and Mrs. Pennington have a  standing disagreement about it. The last girl left here because she  couldn't stand the cats; they affected her nerves, she said. I hope  you don't mind them.\"    \"Oh, no; I kind of like cats. I've been tryin' to count them. Has  anyone ever done that?\"    \"Not that I know of. I tried but I had to give up in despair--never  could tell when I was counting the same cat over again. Look at that  black goblin sunning himself on the woodpile. I say, Nelly, you're not  going, are you?\"    \"I must. It's time to get dinner. Mr. Pennington will be in from the  fields soon.\"    The next minute he heard her stepping briskly about the kitchen,  shooing out intruding cats, and humming a darky air to herself. He  went reluctantly back to the shore and rowed across the river in a  brown study.    I don't know whether Winslow was afflicted with chronic thirst or not,  or whether the East side water wasn't so good as that of the West  side; but I do know that he fairly haunted the Pennington farmhouse  after that. Mrs. Pennington was home the next time he went, and he  asked her about her new girl. To his surprise the good lady was  unusually reticent. She couldn't really say very much about Nelly. No,  she didn't belong anywhere near Riverside. In fact, she--Mrs.  Pennington--didn't think she had any settled home at present. Her  father was travelling over the country somewhere. Nelly was a good  little girl, and very obliging. Beyond this Winslow could get no more  information, so he went around and talked to Nelly, who was sitting on  the bench under the poplars and seemed absorbed in watching the  sunset.    She dropped her g's badly and made some grammatical errors that caused  Winslow's flesh to creep on his bones. But any man could have forgiven  mistakes from such dimpled lips in such a sweet voice.    He asked her to go for a row up the river in the twilight and she  assented; she handled an oar very well, he found out, and the exercise  became her. Winslow tried to get her to talk about herself, but failed  signally and had to content himself with Mrs. Pennington's meagre  information. He told her about himself frankly enough--how he had had  fever in the spring and had been ordered to spend the summer in the  country and do nothing useful until his health was fully restored, and  how lonesome it was in Riverside in general and at the Beckwith farm  in particular. He made out quite a dismal case for himself and if  Nelly wasn't sorry for him, she should have been.           *       *       *       *       *    At the end of a fortnight Riverside folks began to talk about Winslow  and the Penningtons' hired girl. He was reported to be \"dead gone\" on  her; he took her out rowing every evening, drove her to preaching up  the Bend on Sunday nights, and haunted the Pennington farmhouse. Wise  folks shook their heads over it and wondered that Mrs. Pennington  allowed it. Winslow was a gentleman, and that Nelly Ray, whom nobody  knew anything about, not even where she came from, was only a common  hired girl, and he had no business to be hanging about her. She was  pretty, to be sure; but she was absurdly stuck-up and wouldn't  associate with other Riverside \"help\" at all. Well, pride must have a  fall; there must be something queer about her when she was so awful  sly as to her past life.    Winslow and Nelly did not trouble themselves in the least over all  this gossip; in fact, they never even heard it. Winslow was hopelessly  in love, when he found this out he was aghast. He thought of his  father, the ambitious railroad magnate; of his mother, the brilliant  society leader; of his sisters, the beautiful and proud; he was  honestly frightened. It would never do; he must not go to see Nelly  again. He kept this prudent resolution for twenty-four hours and then  rowed over to the West shore. He found Nelly sitting on the bank in  her old faded print dress and he straightway forgot everything he  ought to have remembered.    Nelly herself never seemed to be conscious of the social gulf between  them. At least she never alluded to it in any way, and accepted  Winslow's attentions as if she had a perfect right to them. She had  broken the record by staying with Mrs. Pennington four weeks, and  even the cats were in subjection.    Winslow was well enough to have gone back to the city and, in fact,  his father was writing for him. But he couldn't leave Beckwiths',  apparently. At any rate he stayed on and met Nelly every day and  cursed himself for a cad and a cur and a weak-brained idiot.    One day he took Nelly for a row up the river. They went further than  usual around the Bend. Winslow didn't want to go too far, for he knew  that a party of his city friends, chaperoned by Mrs. Keyton-Wells,  were having a picnic somewhere up along the river shore that day. But  Nelly insisted on going on and on, and of course she had her way. When  they reached a little pine-fringed headland they came upon the  picnickers, within a stone's throw. Everybody recognized Winslow.  \"Why, there is Burton!\" he heard Mrs. Keyton-Wells exclaim, and he  knew she was putting up her glasses. Will Evans, who was an especial  chum of his, ran down to the water's edge. \"Bless me, Win, where did  you come from? Come right in. We haven't had tea yet. Bring your  friend too,\" he added, becoming conscious that Winslow's friend was a  mighty pretty girl. Winslow's face was crimson. He avoided Nelly's  eye.    \"Are them people friends of yours?\" she asked in a low tone.    \"Yes,\" he muttered.    \"Well, let us go ashore if they want us to,\" she said calmly. \"I don't  mind.\"    For three seconds Winslow hesitated. Then he pulled ashore and helped  Nelly to alight on a jutting rock. There was a curious, set expression  about his fine mouth as he marched Nelly up to Mrs. Keyton-Wells and  introduced her. Mrs. Keyton-Wells's greeting was slightly cool, but  very polite. She supposed Miss Ray was some little country girl with  whom Burton Winslow was carrying on a summer flirtation; respectable  enough, no doubt, and must be treated civilly, but of course wouldn't  expect to be made an equal of exactly."]]]
