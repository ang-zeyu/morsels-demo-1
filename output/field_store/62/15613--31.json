The hounds were, at this time,  close to his haunches, and a couple and a half of the leading dogs  went over with the stag. Two of the hounds were so hurt that they  could not move, and the third was found by the greencoat first up,  lying on the dead deer.\"           *       *       *       *       *    I am indebted to that clever and intelligent authoress, Mrs. S. Carter  Hall, for her recollections of an Irish wolf-dog and his master, which  I cannot do better than give in her own words:--    \"When I was a child, I had a very close friendship with a genuine old  wolf-dog, Bruno by name. He was the property of an old friend of my  grandmother's, who claimed descent from the Irish kings. His name was  O'Toole. His manners were the most courtly you can imagine; as they  might well be, for he had spent much time and fortune at the French  court, when Marie Antoinette was in her prime and beauty. His visits  were my jubilees--there was the kind, dignified old gentleman, who  told me tales--there was his tall, gaunt dog, grey with age, and yet  with me full of play; and there were two rough terriers, whom Bruno  kept in admirable order. He managed the little one by simply placing  his paw upon it when it was too frisky; but Vixen, the large one, like  many ladies, had a will of her own, and entertained some idea of being  mistress. Bruno would bear a good deal from her, giving, however, now  and then, a low deep growl; but when provoked too much, he would  quietly lift the dog off the ground by the strength of his jaws (his  teeth were gone), stand with her in his mouth at the doors until they  were opened, and then deposit her, half strangled as she was, in a  nettle-bed some distance from the house. The dog's discrimination was  curious. If Vixen was thrown upon him, or if we forced her to insult  him, he never punished her; but if she of her own accord teazed him  more than his patience could bear, the punishment was certain to  follow.    \"O'Toole and his dogs always occupied the same room, the terriers  being on the bed with their master. No entreaty, however, ever induced  Bruno to sleep on anything softer than stone. He would remove the  hearth-rug and lay on the marble. His master used to instance the  dog's disdain of luxury as a mark of his noble nature.    \"I should not omit to tell you, as characteristic of my old friend,  that O'Toole was proud, and never would submit to be called 'Mr.'  Meeting, one day, Lord Arne in Dame Street, Dublin, while the old man  was followed by his three wolf-dogs, of which Bruno was the last, the  young nobleman, who had also his followers in the shape of 'Parliament  men,' said to the descendant of Irish kings, nodding to him familiarly  at the same time, 'How do you do, _Mr._ O'Toole?' The old man paused,  drew himself up, lifted his hat, made his courtly bow, and answered,  'O'Toole salutes Arne.' I can recall nothing more picturesque than  that majestic old gentleman and his dog, both remnants of a bygone  age. Bruno was rough, but not long-coated, very grave, observant,  enduring every one, very fond of children, playing with them gently,  but only crouching and fawning on his master; 'and that,' O'Toole  would say, 'is a proof of my royal blood.' I could fill a volume with  memoirs of that fine old man. He was more than six feet in height, and  his dog always sat with his head on his master's knee.\"    This is altogether a pretty and interesting picture.    The sagacity of this fine breed is well illustrated in what follows:--    A gentleman walking along the road on Kingston Hill, accompanied by a  friend and a noble deer-hound, which was also a retriever, threw his  glove into a ditch; and having walked on for a mile, sent his dog back  for it. After waiting a considerable time, and the dog not returning,  they retraced their steps. Hearing loud cries in the distance, they  hastened on, and at last saw the dog dragging a boy by his coat  towards them. On questioning the boy, it appeared that he had picked  up the glove and put it into his pocket. The sagacious animal had no  other means of conveying it to his master than by compelling the boy  to accompany him.           *       *       *       *       *    The following anecdotes are from Capt. Thomas Brown's now scarce work,  \"Biographical Sketches and Anecdotes of Dogs.\" He says:--    \"Sir Walter Scott has most obligingly furnished me with the following  anecdotes of his celebrated dog Maida:--    \"I was once riding over a field on which the reapers were at work, the  stooks being placed behind them, as is usual. Maida having found a  hare, began to chase her, to the great amusement of the spectators, as  the hare turned very often and very swiftly among the stooks. At  length, being hard pressed, she fairly bolted into one of them. Maida  went in headlong after her, and the stook began to be much agitated in  various directions. At length the sheaves tumbled down; and the hare  and the dog, terrified alike at their overthrow, ran different ways,  to the great amusement of the spectators.\"    \"Among several peculiarities which Maida possessed, one was a strong  aversion to a certain class of artists, arising from the frequent  restraints he was subjected to in having his portrait taken, on  account of his majestic appearance. The instant he saw a pencil and  paper produced he prepared to beat a retreat; and, if forced to  remain, he exhibited the strongest marks of displeasure.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Ranaldson Macdonell, Esq. of Glengarry, has most kindly furnished the  following interesting notices and anecdotes of the Scottish Highland  greyhound:--    \"Not many years since one of Glengarry's tenants, who had some  business with his chief, happened to arrive at Glengarry House at  rather an early hour in the morning. A deer-hound perceiving this  person sauntering about before the domestics were astir, walked  quietly up to him, took him gently by the wrist with his teeth, and  proceeded to lead him off the ground. The man, finding him forbearing,  attempted resistance; but the dog, instantly seizing his wrist with  redoubled pressure, soon convinced him that his attempt was in vain.  Thus admonished, the man took the hint, and quietly yielded to his  canine conductor, who, without farther injury, led him to the outside  of the gate, and then left him. The whole of the dogs at Glengarry  House were allowed to go at liberty at all times.    \"The Highland greyhounds, or deer-hounds as they are called in the  Highlands, have a great antipathy to the sheep-dogs, and never fail to  attack them whenever an opportunity offers. A shepherd, whose colley  had frequently been attacked by the deer-dogs of Glengarry singly, and  always succeeded in beating them off on such occasions, was one day  assailed by them in a body; and his life would have been in  considerable danger, but for one of the keepers, who happened to pass  at the time, and called them off.    \"The following circumstance will prove the exquisite sense of smell  possessed by the deer-hound. One of this breed, named Bran, when held  in the leash, followed the track of a wounded stag, and that in most  unfavourable rainy weather, for three successive days, at the end of  which time the game was shot. He was wounded first within nine miles  of Invergarry House, and was traced that night to the estate of  Glenmoriston. At dusk in the evening the deer-stalkers placed a stone  on each side of the last fresh print of his hoof, and another over it;  and this they did each night following. On the succeeding morning they  removed the upper stone, when the dog recovered the scent, and the  deer was that day traced over a great part of Glenmoriston's ground.  On the third day he was retraced to the lands of Glengarry, and there  shot.    \"My present dog, Comhstri, to great courage unites the quality of a  gentle disposition, with much fidelity and attachment. Though not so  large as some of his kindred, he is nevertheless as high-spirited and  determined as any of his race, which the following circumstance will  testify: 'About three years ago, a deer from the wood of Derrygarbh,  whose previous hurts had been healed, came out of Glengarry's pass,  who wounded it severely in the body with a rifle bullet. The  deer-hounds were immediately laid on the blood-track. The stag was  started in the course of a few minutes; the dogs were instantly  slipped, and the fine animal ran to bay in a deep pool of water, below  a cascade, on the Garyquulach burn. Comhstri immediately plunged in,  and seized the stag by the throat; both went under water, surrounded  with the white foam, slightly tinged with the deer's blood. The dog  soon came to the surface to recover his breath; and before the other  could do so, Comhstri dived, and again seized him by the throat. The  stag was soon after taken out of the pool dead.    \"Comhstri's colour is grey, with a white chest; but we have had them  of different colours at Glengarry, such as pure white, black,  brindled, and sand-colour.    \"When the Highlanders dream of a _black_ dog, it is interpreted to  mean one of the clan of Macdonell; but if of a deer-hound, it denotes  a chief, or one of the principal persons of that clan.\"           *       *       *       *       *    That the Scottish dogs were much prized in England from the earliest  times, the following interesting account, taken from Holinshed's  Chronicles, 'Historie of Scotland,' p. 71, printed in 1586, will show.  \"And shortlie after the return of these ambassadors into their  countrie, divers young gentlemen of the Pictish nobilitie repaired  unto King Crathlint, to hunt and make merie with him; "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26556"],[0,"Myths and Marvels of Astronomy (#20)"],[1,"one or  other of the tests he applies will afford the required evidence. To one,  says St. Paul, is given the word of wisdom; to another, the word of  knowledge; to another, faith; to another, the gift of healing; to  another, the working of miracles; to another, prophecy; to another, the  discerning of spirits; to another, divers kinds of tongues: and so  forth. If a man like Mahomet, who believes in his mission to teach,  finds that he cannot satisfactorily work miracles--that mountains will  not be removed at his bidding--then some other evidence satisfies him of  the reality of his mission. Swedenborg, than whom, perhaps, no more  honest man ever lived, said and believed that to him had been granted  the discerning of spirits. 'It is to be observed,' he said, 'that a man  may be instructed by spirits and angels if his interiors be so open as  to enable him to speak and be in company with them, for man in his  essence is a spirit, and is with spirits as to his interiors; so that  he whose interiors are opened by the Lord may converse with them, as  man with man. _This privilege I have enjoyed daily now for twelve  years._'    It indicates the fulness of Swedenborg's belief in this privilege that  he did not hesitate to describe what the spirits taught him respecting  matters which belong rather to science than to faith; though it must be  admitted that probably he supposed there was small reason for believing  that his statements could ever be tested by the results of scientific  research. The objects to which his spiritual communications related were  conveniently remote. I do not say this as desiring for one moment to  suggest that he purposely selected those objects, and not others which  might be more readily examined. He certainly believed in the reality of  the communications he described. But possibly there is some law in  things visionary, corresponding to the law of mental operation with  regard to scientific theories; and as the mind theorises freely about a  subject little understood, but cautiously where many facts have been  ascertained, so probably exact knowledge of a subject prevents the  operation of those illusions which are regarded as supernatural  communications. It is in a dim light only that the active imagination  pictures objects which do not really exist; in the clear light of day  they can no longer be imagined. So it is with mental processes.    Probably there is no subject more suitable in this sense for the  visionary than that of life in other worlds. It has always had an  attraction for imaginative minds, simply because it is enwrapped in so  profound a mystery; and there has been little to restrain the fancy,  because so little is certainly known of the physical condition of other  worlds. Recently, indeed, a somewhat sudden and severe check has been  placed on the liveliness of imagination which had enabled men formerly  to picture to themselves the inhabitants of other orbs in space.  Spectroscopic analysis and exact telescopic scrutiny will not permit  some speculations to be entertained which formerly met with favour. Yet  even now there has been but a slight change of scene and time. If men  can no longer imagine inhabitants of one planet because it is too hot,  or of another because it is too cold, of one body because it is too  deeply immersed in vaporous masses, or of another because it has neither  atmosphere nor water, we have only to speculate about the unseen worlds  which circle round those other suns, the stars; or, instead of changing  the region of space where we imagine worlds, we can look backward to the  time when planets now cold and dead were warm with life, or forward to  the distant future when planets now glowing with fiery heat shall have  cooled down to a habitable condition.    Swedenborg's imaginative mind seems to have fully felt the charm of this  interesting subject. It was, indeed, because of the charm which he found  in it, that he was readily persuaded into the belief that knowledge had  been supernaturally communicated to him respecting it. 'Because I had a  desire,' he says, 'to know if there are other earths, and to learn their  nature and the character of their inhabitants, it was granted me by the  Lord to converse and have intercourse with spirits and angels who had  come from other earths, with some for a day, with some for a week, and  with some for months. From them I have received information respecting  the earths from and near which they are, the modes of life, customs and  worship of their inhabitants, besides various other particulars of  interest, all which, having come to my knowledge in this way, I can  describe as things which I have seen and heard.'    It is interesting (psychologically) to notice how the reasoning which  had convinced Swedenborg of the existence of other inhabited worlds is  attributed by him to the spirits. 'It is well known in the other life,'  he says, 'that there are many earths with men upon them; for there (that  is, in the spiritual life) every one who, from a love of truth and  consequent use, desires it, is allowed to converse with the spirits of  other earths, so as to be assured that there is a plurality of worlds,  and be informed that the human race is not confined to one earth only,  but extends to numberless earths.... I have occasionally conversed on  this subject with the spirits of our earth, and the result of our  conversation was that a man of enlarged understanding may conclude from  various considerations that there are many earths with human inhabitants  upon them. For it is an inference of reason that masses so great as the  planets are, some of which exceed this earth in magnitude, are not empty  bodies, created only to be carried in their motion round the sun, and to  shine with their scanty light for the benefit of one earth only; but  that they must have a nobler use. He who believes, as every one ought to  believe, that the Deity created the universe for no other end than the  existence of the human race, and of heaven from it (for the human race  is the seminary of heaven), must also believe that wherever there is an  earth there are human inhabitants. That the planets which are visible to  us, being within the boundary of our solar system, are earths, may  appear from various considerations. They are bodies of earthy matter,  because they reflect the sun's light, and when seen through the  telescope appear, not as stars shining with a flaming lustre, but as  earths, variegated with obscure spots. Like our earth, they are carried  round the sun by a progressive motion, through the path of the Zodiac,  whence they have years and seasons of the year, which are spring,  summer, autumn, and winter; and they rotate upon their axes, which makes  days, and times of the day, as morning, midday, evening, and night. Some  of them also have satellites, which perform their revolutions about  their globes, as the moon does about ours. The planet Saturn, as being  farthest from the sun, has besides an immense luminous ring, which  supplies that earth with much, though reflected, light. How is it  possible for anyone acquainted with these facts, and who thinks from  reason, to assert that such bodies are uninhabited?'    Remembering that this reasoning was urged by the spirits, and that  during twelve years Swedenborg's interiors had been opened in such sort  that he could converse with spirits from other worlds, it is surprising  that he should have heard nothing about Uranus or Neptune, to say  nothing of the zone of asteroids, or again, of planets as yet unknown  which may exist outside the path of Neptune. He definitely commits  himself, it will be observed, to the statement that Saturn is the planet  farthest from the sun. And elsewhere, in stating where in these  spiritual communications the 'idea' of each planet was conceived to be  situated, he leaves no room whatever for Uranus and Neptune, and makes  no mention of other bodies in the solar system than those known in his  day. This cannot have been because the spirits from then unknown planets  did not feel themselves called upon to communicate with the spirit of  one who knew nothing of their home, for he received visitors from worlds  in the starry heavens far beyond human ken. It would almost seem, though  to the faithful Swedenborgian the thought will doubtless appear very  wicked, that the system of Swedenborg gave no place to Uranus and  Neptune, simply because he knew nothing about those planets. Otherwise,  what a noble opportunity there would have been for establishing the  truth of Swedenborgian doctrines by revealing to the world the existence  of planets hitherto unknown. Before the reader pronounces this a task  beneath the dignity of the spirits and angels who taught Swedenborg it  will be well for him to examine the news which they actually imparted.    I may as well premise, however, that it does not seem to me worth while  to enter here at any length into Swedenborg's descriptions of the  inhabitants of other worlds, because what he has to say on this subject  is entirely imaginative. There is a real interest for us in his ideas  respecting the condition of the planets, because those ideas were based  (though unconsciously) upon the science of his day, in which he was no  mean proficient. And even where his mysticism went beyond what his  scientific attainments suggested, a psychological interest attaches to  the workings of his imagination. It is as curious a problem to trace his  ideas to their origin as it sometimes is to account for the various  phases of a fantastic dream, such a dream, for instance, as that which  Armadale, the doctor, and Midwinter, in 'Armadale,' endeavour to connect  with preceding events. But Swedenborg's visions of the behaviour and  appearance of the inhabitants of other earths have little interest,  because it is hopeless to attempt to account for even their leading  features."]]]
