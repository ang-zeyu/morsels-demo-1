[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2898"],[0,"Pioneers of the Old South: A Chronicle of English Colonial Beginnings (#20)"],[1," began to quiver hard in the Virginian frame. The King was  no longer popular, nor Sir William Berkeley, nor were the most of the  Council, nor many of the burgesses of that Long Assembly. There arose a  loud demand for a new election and for changes in public policy.    Where a part of Richmond now stands, there stretched at that time a  tract of fields and hills and a clear winding creek, held by a young  planter named Nathaniel Bacon, an Englishman of that family which  produced \"the wisest, greatest, meanest of mankind.\" The planter himself  lived farther down the river. But he had at this place an overseer  and some indentured laborers. This Nathaniel Bacon was a newcomer  in Virginia--young man who had been entered in Gray's Inn, who had  traveled, who was rumored to have run through much of his own estate.  He had a cousin, also named Nathaniel Bacon, who had come fifteen years  earlier to Virginia \"a very rich, politic man and childless,\" and whose  representations had perhaps drawn the younger Bacon to Virginia. At any  rate he was here, and at the age of twenty-eight the owner of much land  and the possessor of a seat in the Council. But, though he sat in  the Council, he was hardly of the mind of the Governor and those who  supported him.    It was in the spring of 1676 that there began a series of Indian attacks  directed against the plantations and the outlying cabins of the region  above the Falls of the Far West. Among the victims were men of Bacon's  plantation, for his overseer and several of his servants were slain. The  news of this massacre of his men set their young master afire. Even a  less hideous tale might have done it, for he was of a bold and ardent  nature.    Riding up the forest tracks, a company of planters from the threatened  neighborhood gathered together. \"Let us make a troop and take fire and  sword among them!\" There lacked a commander. \"Mr. Bacon, you command!\"  Very good; and Mr. Bacon, who is a born orator, made a speech dealing  with the \"grievances of the times.\" Very good indeed; but still there  lacked the Governor's commission. \"Send a swift messenger to Jamestown  for it!\"    The messenger went and returned. No commission. Mr. Bacon had made an  unpleasant impression upon Sir William Berkeley. This young man,  the Governor said, was \"popularly inclined\"--had \"a constitution not  consistent with\" all that Berkeley stood for. Bacon and his neighbors  listened with bent brows to their envoy's report. Murmurs began and  deepened. \"Shall we stand idly here considering formalities, while the  redskins murder?\" Commission or no commission, they would march; and in  the end, march they did--a considerable troop--to the up-river country,  with the tall, young, eloquent man at their head.    News reached the Governor at Jamestown that they were marching. In a  tight-lipped rage he issued a proclamation and sent it after them. They  and their leader were acting illegally, usurping military powers that  belonged elsewhere! Let them disband, disperse to their dwellings, or  beware action of the rightful powers! Troubled in mind, some disbanded  and dispersed, but threescore at least would by no means do so. Nor  would the young man \"of precipitate disposition\" who headed the troop.  He rode on into the forest after the Indians, and the others followed  him. Here were the Falls of the Far West, and here on a hill the Indians  had a \"fort.\" This the Virginia planters attacked. The hills above the  James echoed to the sound of the small, desperate fray. In the end the  red men were routed. Some were slain; some were taken prisoner; others  escaped into the deep woods stretching westward.    In the meantime another force of horsemen had been gathered. It was  headed by Berkeley and was addressed to the pursuit and apprehension  of Nathaniel Bacon, who had thus defied authority. But before Berkeley  could move far, fire broke out around him. The grievances of the people  were many and just, and not without a family resemblance to those that  precipitated the Revolution a hundred years later. Not Bacon alone, but  many others who were in despair of any good under their present masters  were ready for heroic measures. Berkeley found himself ringed about by  a genuine popular revolt. He therefore lacked the time now to pursue  Nathaniel Bacon, but spurred back to Jamestown there to deal as best  he might with dangerous affairs. At Jamestown, willy-nilly, the old  Governor was forced to promise reforms. The Long Assembly should be  dissolved and a new Assembly, more conformable to the wishes of the  people, should come into being ready to consider all their troubles.  So writs went out; and there presently followed a hot and turbulent  election, in which that \"restricted franchise\" of the Long Assembly  was often defied and in part set aside. Men without property presented  themselves, gave their voices, and were counted. Bacon, who had by now  achieved an immense popularity, was chosen burgess for Henricus County.    In the June weather Bacon sailed down to Jamestown, with a number of  those who had backed him in that assumption of power to raise troops  and go against the Indians. When he came to Jamestown it was to find the  high sheriff waiting for him by the Governor's orders. He was put under  arrest. Hot discussion followed. But the people were for the moment  in the ascendent, and Bacon should not be sacrificed. A compromise  was reached. Bacon was technically guilty of \"unlawful, mutinous and  rebellious practises.\" If, on his knees before Governor, Council, and  Burgesses, he would acknowledge as much and promise henceforth to be his  Majesty's obedient servant, he and those implicated with him should  be pardoned. He himself might be readmitted to the Council, and all in  Virginia should be as it had been. He should even have the commission he  had acted without to go and fight against the Indians.    Bacon thereupon made his submission upon his knees, promising that  henceforth he would \"demean himself dutifully, faithfully, and  peaceably.\" Formally forgiven, he was restored to his place in the  Virginia Council. An eyewitness reports that presently he saw \"Mr.  Bacon on his quondam seat with the Governor and Council, which seemed  a marvellous indulgence to one whom he had so lately proscribed as a  rebel.\" The Assembly of 1676 was of a different temper and opinion from  that of the Long Assembly. It was an insurgent body, composed to a large  degree of mere freemen and small planters, with a few of the richer,  more influential sort who nevertheless queried that old divine right of  rule. Berkeley thought that he had good reason to doubt this Assembly's  intentions, once it gave itself rein. He directs it therefore to confine  its attention to Indian troubles. It did, indeed, legislate on Indian  affairs by passing an elaborate act for the prosecution of the war.  An army of a thousand white men was to be raised. Bacon was to be  commander-in-chief. All manner of precautions were to be taken. But this  matter disposed of, the Assembly thereupon turned to \"the redressing  several grievances the country was then labouring under; and motions  were made for inspecting the public revenues, the collectors' accounts,\"  and so forth. The Governor thundered; friends of the old order  obstructed; but the Assembly went on its way, reforming here and  reforming there. It even went so far as to repeal the preceding  Assembly's legislation regarding the franchise. All white males who are  freemen were now privileged to vote, \"together with the freeholders and  housekeepers.\"    A certain member wanted some detail of procedure retained because it was  customary. \"Tis true it has been customary,\" answered another, \"but  if we have any bad customs amongst us, we are come here to mend 'em!\"  \"Whereupon,\" says the contemporary narrator, \"the house was set in  a laughter.\" But after so considerable an amount of mending there  threatened a standstill. What was to come next? Could men go further--as  they had gone further in England not so many years ago? Reform had come  to an apparent impasse. While it thus hesitated, the old party gained in  life.    Bacon, now petitioning for his promised commission against the Indians,  seems to have reached the conclusion that the Governor might promise but  meant not to perform, and not only so, but that in Jamestown his very  life was in danger. He had \"intimation that the Governor's generosity  in pardoning him and restoring him to his place in the Council were no  other than previous wheedles to amuse him.\"    In Jamestown lived one whom a chronicler paints for us as \"thoughtful  Mr. Lawrence.\" This gentleman was an Oxford scholar, noted for \"wit,  learning, and sobriety... nicely honest, affable, and without blemish in  his conversation and dealings.\" Thus friends declared, though foes said  of him quite other things. At any rate, having emigrated to Virginia and  married there, he had presently acquired, because of a lawsuit over land  in which he held himself to be unjustly and shabbily treated through  influences of the Governor, an inveterate prejudice against that ruler.  He calls him in short \"an old, treacherous villain.\" Lawrence and  his wife, not being rich, kept a tavern at Jamestown, and there Bacon  lodged, probably having been thrown with Lawrence before this. Persons  are found who hold that Lawrence was the brain, Bacon the arm, of the  discontent in Virginia. There was also Mr. William Drummond, who will be  met with in the account of Carolina. He was a \"sober Scotch gentleman of  good repute\"--but no more than Lawrence on good terms with the Governor  of Virginia.    On a morning in June, when the Assembly met, it was observed that  Nathaniel Bacon was not in his place in the Council--nor was he to be  found in the building, nor even in Jamestown itself, though Berkeley had  Lawrence's inn searched for him. He had left the town--"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2900"],[0,"The Age of Invention: A Chronicle of Mechanical Conquest (#20)"],[1,"with a roll of sensitized paper long enough for a hundred  exposures. Sent to the makers, the roll could itself be developed  and pictures could be printed from it. Eastman had been an amateur  photographer when the fancy was both expensive and tedious. Inventing a  method of making dry plates, he began to manufacture them in a small way  as early as 1880. After the first kodak, there came others filled with  rolls of sensitized nitro-cellulose film. Priority in the invention  of the cellulose film, instead of glass, which has revolutionized  photography, has been decided by the courts to belong to the Reverend  Hannibal Goodwin, but the honor none the less belongs to Eastman,  who independently worked out his process and gave photography to the  millions. The introduction by the Eastman Kodak Company of a film  cartridge which could be inserted or removed without retiring to a dark  room removed the chief difficulty in the way of amateurs, and a camera  of some sort, varying in price from a dollar or two to as many hundreds,  is today an indispensable part of a vacation equipment.    In the development of the animated pictures Thomas Alva Edison has  played a large part. Many were the efforts to give the appearance of  movement to pictures before the first real entertainment was staged by  Henry Heyl of Philadelphia. Heyl's pictures were on glass plates fixed  in the circumference of a wheel, and each was brought and held for a  part of a second before the lens. This method was obviously too slow and  too expensive. Edison with his keen mind approached the difficulty and  after a prolonged series of experiments arrived at the decision that  a continuous tape-like film would be necessary. He invented the first  practical \"taking\" camera and evoked the enthusiastic cooperation of  George Eastman in the production of this tape-like film, and the modern  motion picture was born. The projecting machine was substantially like  the \"taking\" camera and was so used. Other inventors, such as Paul  in England and Lumiere in France, produced other types of projecting  machines, which differed only in mechanical details.    When the motion picture was taken up in earnest in the United States,  the world stared in astonishment at the apparent recklessness of the  early managers. The public responded, however, and there is hardly a  hamlet in the nation where there is not at least one moving-picture  house. The most popular actors have been drawn from the speaking stage  into the \"movies,\" and many new actors have been developed. In the small  town, the picture theater is often a converted storeroom, but in the  cities, some of the largest and most attractive theaters have been given  over to the pictures, and others even more luxurious have been specially  built. The Eastman Company alone manufactures about ten thousand miles  of film every month.    Besides affording amusement to millions, the moving picture has been  turned to instruction. Important news events are shown on the screen,  and historical events are preserved for posterity by depositing the  films in a vault. What would the historical student not give for a film  faithfully portraying the inauguration of George Washington! The motion  picture has become an important factor in instruction in history and  science in the schools and this development is still in its infancy.        CHAPTER VII. THE STORY OF RUBBER    One day in 1852, at Trenton, New Jersey, there appeared in the Circuit  Court of the United States two men, the legal giants of their day, to  argue the case of Goodyear vs. Day for infringement of patent. Rufus  Choate represented the defendant and Daniel Webster the plaintiff.  Webster, in the course of his plea, one of the most brilliant and  moving ever uttered by him, paused for a moment, drew from himself the  attention of those who were hanging upon his words, and pointed to his  client. He would have them look at the man whose cause he pleaded: a  man of fifty-two, who looked fifteen years older, sallow, emaciated from  disease, due to long privations, bitter disappointments, and wrongs.  This was Charles Goodyear, inventor of the process which put rubber into  the service of the world. Said Webster:    \"And now is Charles Goodyear the discoverer of this invention of  vulcanized rubber? Is he the first man upon whose mind the idea ever  flashed, or to whose intelligence the fact ever was disclosed, that by  carrying heat to a certain height it would cease to render plastic the  India Rubber and begin to harden and metallize it? Is there a man in the  world who found out that fact before Charles Goodyear? Who is he? Where  is he? On what continent does he live? Who has heard of him? What books  treat of him? What man among all the men on earth has seen him, known  him, or named him? Yet it is certain that this discovery has been made.  It is certain that it exists. It is certain that it is now a matter of  common knowledge all over the civilized world. It is certain that ten or  twelve years ago it was not knowledge. It is certain that this curious  result has grown into knowledge by somebody's discovery and invention.  And who is that somebody? The question was put to my learned opponent by  my learned associate. If Charles Goodyear did not make this discovery,  who did make it? Who did make it? Why, if our learned opponent had said  he should endeavor to prove that some one other than Mr. Goodyear had  made this discovery, that would have been very fair. I think the learned  gentleman was very wise in not doing so. For I have thought often, in  the course of my practice in law, that it was not very advisable to  raise a spirit that one could not conveniently lay again. Now who made  this discovery? And would it not be proper? I am sure it would. And  would it not be manly? I am sure it would. Would not my learned friend  and his coadjutor have acted a more noble part, if they had stood up and  said that this invention was not Goodyear's, but it was an invention of  such and such a man, in this or that country? On the contrary they do  not meet Goodyear's claim by setting up a distinct claim of anybody  else. They attempt to prove that he was not the inventor by little  shreds and patches of testimony. Here a little bit of sulphur, and there  a little parcel of lead; here a little degree of heat, a little hotter  than would warm a man's hands, and in which a man could live for ten  minutes or a quarter of an hour; and yet they never seem to come to the  point. I think it is because their materials did not allow them to  come to the manly assertion that somebody else did make this invention,  giving to that somebody a local habitation and a name. We want to know  the name, and the habitation, and the location of the man upon the face  of this globe, who invented vulcanized rubber, if it be not he, who now  sits before us.    \"Well there are birds which fly in the air, seldom lighting, but often  hovering. Now I think this is a question not to be hovered over, not to  be brooded over, and not to be dealt with as an infinitesimal quantity  of small things. It is a case calling for a manly admission and a manly  defense. I ask again, if there is anybody else than Goodyear who made  this invention, who is he? Is the discovery so plain that it might have  come about by accident? It is likely to work important changes in the  arts everywhere. IT INTRODUCES QUITE A NEW MATERIAL INTO THE MANUFACTURE  OF THE ARTS, THAT MATERIAL BEING NOTHING LESS THAN ELASTIC METAL. It is  hard like metal and as elastic as pure original gum elastic. Why, that  is as great and momentous a phenomenon occurring to men in the progress  of their knowledge, as it would be for a man to show that iron and gold  could remain iron and gold and yet become elastic like India Rubber. It  would be just such another result. Now, this fact cannot be denied; it  cannot be secreted; it cannot be kept out of sight; somebody has  made this invention. That is certain. Who is he? Mr. Hancock has been  referred to. But he expressly acknowledges Goodyear to be the first  inventor. I say that there is not in the world a human being that can  stand up and say that it is his invention, except the man who is sitting  at that table.\"      The court found for the plaintiff, and this decision established for  all time the claim of the American, Charles Goodyear, to be the sole  inventor of vulcanized rubber.    This trial may be said to be the dramatic climax in the story of rubber.  It celebrated the hour when the science of invention turned a raw  product--which had tantalized by its promise and wrought ruin by its  treachery--into a manufacture adaptable to a thousand uses, adding  to man's ease and health and to the locomotion, construction, and  communication of modern life.    When Columbus revisited Hayti on his second voyage, he observed some  natives playing with a ball. Now, ball games are the oldest sport known.  From the beginning of his history man, like the kitten and the puppy,  has delighted to play with the round thing that rolls. The men who  came with Columbus to conquer the Indies had brought their Castilian  wind-balls to play with in idle hours. But at once they found that the  balls of Hayti were incomparably superior toys; they bounced better.  These high bouncing balls were made, so they learned, from a milky  fluid of the consistency of honey which the natives procured by tapping  certain trees and then cured over the smoke of palm nuts. A discovery  which improved the delights of ball games was noteworthy.    The old Spanish historian, Herrera, gravely transcribed in his pages  all that the governors of Hayti reported about the bouncing balls. Some  fifty years later another Spanish historian related that the natives  of the Amazon valley made shoes of this gum; and that Spanish soldiers  spread their cloaks with it to keep out the rain. Many years later  still,"]]]
