If they burned the prairie and dropped seeds into  holes, the corn or beans which they thus planted were sure to be choked  by the quickly springing grass. To dig away the tough sod around the  hole for each seed would require an almost incredible amount of work  even with iron tools. To accomplish this with wooden spades, rude hoes  made of large flakes of flint, or the shoulder blades of the buffalo,  was impossible on any large scale. Now and then in some river bottom  where the grass grew in clumps and could be easily pulled up, a little  agriculture was possible. That is all that seems to have been attempted  on the great grassy plains.    The Indians could not undertake any widespread cultivation of the plains  not only because they lacked iron tools but also because they had no  draft animals. The buffalo was too big, too fierce, and too stupid to  be domesticated. In all the length and breadth of the two Americas there  was no animal to take the place of the useful horse, donkey, or ox. The  llama was too small to do anything but carry light loads, and it could  live only in a most limited area among the cold Andean highlands. Even  if the aboriginal Americans could have made iron ploughs, they could not  have ploughed the tough sod without the aid of animals. Moreover,  even if the possession of metal tools and beasts of burden had made  agriculture possible in the grass-lands, it would have been difficult,  in the absence of wood for fences, to prevent the buffalo from eating up  the crops or at least from tramping through them and spoiling them. Thus  the fertile land of the great plains remained largely unused until the  white man came to the New World bringing the iron tools and domestic  animals that were necessary to successful agriculture.    Although farming of any sort was almost as impossible in the plains  as in the dry regions of winter rains farther west, the abundance of  buffaloes made life much easier in many respects. It is astonishing to  see how many purposes these animals served. An early traveler who dwelt  among one of the buffalo-hunting tribes, the Tonkawa of central Texas,  says: \"Besides their meat it [the buffalo] furnishes them liberally what  they desire for conveniences. The brains are used to soften skins, the  horns for spoons and drinking cups, the shoulder blades to dig up and  clear off the ground, the tendons for threads and bow strings, the hoofs  to glue the arrow-feathering. From the tail-hair they make ropes  and girths, from the wool, belts and various ornaments. The hide  furnishes... shields, tents, shirts, footwear, and blankets to protect  them from the cold.\" *          *See Hodge, \"Handbook of American Indians,\" vol. II, p. 781.      The buffalo is a surprisingly stupid animal. When a herd is feeding it  is possible for a man to walk into the midst of it and shoot down an  animal. Even when one of their companions falls dead, the buffaloes  pay no attention to the hunter provided he remains perfectly still. The  wounded animals are not at first dangerous but seek to flee. Only when  pursued and brought to bay do they turn on their pursuers. When the  Indians of an encampment united their forces, as was their regular  habit, they were able to slaughter hundreds of animals in a few days.  The more delicate parts of the meat they ate first, often without  cooking them. The rest they dried and packed away for future use, while  they prepared the hides as coverings for the tents or as rugs in which  to sleep.    Wherever the buffaloes were present in large numbers, the habits of the  Indians were much the same. They could not live in settled villages,  for there was no assurance that the buffalo would come to any particular  place each year. The plains tribes were therefore more thoroughly  nomadic than almost any others, especially after the introduction of  horses. Because they wandered so much, they came into contact with  other tribes to an unusual degree, and much of the contact was friendly.  Gradually the Indians developed a sign language by which tribes of  different tongues could communicate with one another. At first these  signs were like pictographs, for the speaker pointed as nearly as  possible to the thing that he desired to indicate, but later they became  more and more conventional. For example, man, the erect animal, was  indicated by throwing up the hand, with its back outward and the index  finger extending upward. Woman was indicated by a sweeping downward  movement of the hand at the side of the head with fingers extended to  denote long hair or the combing of flowing locks.    Among the plains Indians, the Dakotas, the main tribe of the Sioux  family, are universally considered to have stood highest not only  physically but mentally, and probably morally. Their bravery was never  questioned, and they conquered or drove out every rival except the  Chippewas. Their superiority was clearly seen in their system of  government. Personal fitness and popularity determined chieftainship  more than did heredity. The authority of the chief was limited by the  Band Council, without whose approbation little or nothing could be  accomplished. In one of the Dakota tribes, the Tetons, the policing of a  village was confided to two or three officers who were appointed by the  chief and who remained in power until their successors were appointed.  Day and night they were always on the watch, and so arduous were their  labors that their term of service was necessarily short. The brevity of  their term, however, was atoned for by the greatness of their authority,  for in the suppression of disturbances no resistance was suffered. Their  persons were sacred, and if in the execution of their duty they struck  even a chief of the second class they could not be punished.    The Dakotas, who lived in the region where their name is still  preserved, inhabited that part of the great plain which is climatically  most favorable to great activity. It is perhaps because of their  response to the influence of this factor of geographical environment  that they and their neighbors are the best known of the plains tribes.  Their activity in later times is evident from the fact that the Tetons  were called \"the plundering Arabs of America.\" If their activities  had been more wisely directed, they might have made a great name for  themselves in Indian history. In the arts they stood as high as could  be expected in view of the wandering life which they led and the limited  materials with which they had to work. In the art of making pictographs,  for instance, they excelled all other tribes, except perhaps the Kiowas,  a plains tribe of Colorado and western Kansas. On the hides of buffalo,  deer, and antelope which formed their tents, the Dakotas painted  calendars, which had a picture for each year, or rather for each winter,  while those of the Kiowas had a summer symbol and a winter symbol.  Probably these calendars reveal the influence of the whites, but they at  least show that these people of the plains were quickwitted.    Farther south the tribes of the plains stood on a much lower level than  the Dakotas. The Spanish explorer, Cabeza de Vaca, describes the Yguases  in Texas, among whom he lived for several years, in these words: \"Their  support is principally roots which require roasting two days. Many are  very bitter. Occasionally they take deer and at times fish, but the  quantity is so small and the famine so great that they eat spiders and  eggs of ants, worms, lizards, salamanders, snakes, and vipers that kill  whom they strike, and they eat earth and all that there is, the dung of  deer, things I omit to mention and I earnestly believe that were there  stones in that land they would eat them. They save the bones of the fish  they consume, the snakes and other animals, that they may afterward beat  them together and eat the powder.\" During these painful periods, they  bade Cabeza de Vaca \"not to be sad. There would soon be prickly pears,  although the season of this fruit of the cactus might be months distant.  When the pears were ripe, the people feasted and danced and forgot their  former privations. They destroyed their female infants to prevent them  being taken by their enemies and thus becoming the means of increasing  the latter's number.\"    East of the Great Plains there dwelt still another important type of  Indians, the people of the deciduous forests. Their home extended from  the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico. As we have already seen, the  Iroquois who inhabited the northern part of this region were in many  respects the highest product of aboriginal America. The northern  Iroquois tribes, especially those known as the Five Nations, were second  to no other Indian people north of Mexico in political organization,  statecraft, and military prowess. Their leaders were genuine diplomats,  as the wily French and English statesmen with whom they treated soon  discovered. One of their most notable traits was the reverence which  they had for the tribal law. The wars that they waged were primarily  for political independence, for the fundamental principle of their  confederation was that by uniting with one another they would secure the  peace and welfare of all with whom they were connected by ties of blood.  They prevented blood feuds by decreeing that there should be a price for  the killing of a co-tribesman, and they abstained from eating the flesh  of their enemies in order to avoid future strife. So thoroughly did they  believe in the rights of the individual that women were accorded a high  position. Among some of the tribes the consent of all the women who had  borne children was required before any important measure could be taken.

Of this total 64 belonged  to the Gloucesters and 25 to the troops raised in Natal. Next day, as  already narrated, the whole British army was re-assembled once more at  Ladysmith, and the campaign was to enter upon a new phase.    At the end of this first vigorous week of hostilities it is interesting  to sum up the net result. The strategical advantage had lain with the  Boers. They had made our position at Dundee untenable and had driven us  back to Ladysmith. They had the country and the railway for the northern  quarter of the colony in their possession. They had killed and wounded  between six and seven hundred of our men, and they had captured some two  hundred of our cavalry, while we had been compelled at Dundee to leave  considerable stores and our wounded, including General Penn Symons, who  actually died while a prisoner in their hands. On the other hand, the  tactical advantages lay with us. We had twice driven them from their  positions, and captured two of their guns. We had taken two hundred  prisoners, and had probably killed and wounded as many as we had lost.  On the whole, the honours of that week's fighting in Natal may be said  to have been fairly equal--which is more than we could claim for many a  weary week to come.        CHAPTER 7. THE BATTLE OF LADYSMITH.    Sir George White had now reunited his force, and found himself in  command of a formidable little army some twelve thousand in number. His  cavalry included the 5th Lancers, the 5th Dragoons, part of the 18th and  the whole of the 19th Hussars, the Natal Carabineers, the Border Rifles,  some mounted infantry, and the Imperial Light Horse. Among his infantry  were the Royal Irish Fusiliers, the Dublin Fusiliers, and the King's  Royal Rifles, fresh from the ascent of Talana Hill, the Gordons, the  Manchesters, and the Devons who had been blooded at Elandslaagte,  the Leicesters, the Liverpools, the 2nd battalion of the King's Royal  Rifles, the 2nd Rifle Brigade, and the Gloucesters, who had been so  roughly treated at Rietfontein. He had six batteries of excellent field  artillery--the 13th, 21st, 42nd, 53rd, 67th, 69th, and No. 10 Mountain  Battery of screw guns. No general could have asked for a more compact  and workmanlike little force.    It had been recognised by the British General from the beginning that  his tactics must be defensive, since he was largely outnumbered and  since also any considerable mishap to his force would expose the  whole colony of Natal to destruction. The actions of Elandslaagte and  Rietfontein were forced upon him in order to disengage his compromised  detachment, but now there was no longer any reason why he should  assume the offensive. He knew that away out on the Atlantic a trail of  transports which already extended from the Channel to Cape de Verde  were hourly drawing nearer to him with the army corps from England. In a  fortnight or less the first of them would be at Durban. It was his game,  therefore, to keep his army intact, and to let those throbbing engines  and whirling propellers do the work of the empire. Had he entrenched  himself up to his nose and waited, it would have paid him best in the  end.    But so tame and inglorious a policy is impossible to a fighting soldier.  He could not with his splendid force permit himself to be shut in  without an action. What policy demands honour may forbid. On October  27th there were already Boers and rumours of Boers on every side of  him. Joubert with his main body was moving across from Dundee. The  Freestaters were to the north and west. Their combined numbers were  uncertain, but at least it was already proved that they were far more  numerous and also more formidable than had been anticipated. We had had  a taste of their artillery also, and the pleasant delusion that it would  be a mere useless encumbrance to a Boer force had vanished for ever.  It was a grave thing to leave the town in order to give battle, for  the mobile enemy might swing round and seize it behind us. Nevertheless  White determined to make the venture.    On the 29th the enemy were visibly converging upon the town. From a high  hill within rifleshot of the houses a watcher could see no fewer than  six Boer camps to the east and north. French, with his cavalry, pushed  out feelers, and coasted along the edge of the advancing host. His  report warned White that if he would strike before all the scattered  bands were united he must do so at once. The wounded were sent down to  Pietermaritzburg, and it would bear explanation why the non-combatants  did not accompany them. On the evening of the same day Joubert in person  was said to be only six miles off, and a party of his men cut the water  supply of the town. The Klip, however, a fair-sized river, runs through  Ladysmith, so that there was no danger of thirst. The British had  inflated and sent up a balloon, to the amazement of the back-veld Boers;  its report confirmed the fact that the enemy was in force in front of  and around them.    On the night of the 29th General White detached two of his best  regiments, the Irish Fusiliers and the Gloucesters, with No. 10 Mountain  Battery, to advance under cover of the darkness and to seize and hold  a long ridge called Nicholson's Nek, which lay about six miles to the  north of Ladysmith. Having determined to give battle on the next day,  his object was to protect his left wing against those Freestaters who  were still moving from the north and west, and also to keep a pass  open by which his cavalry might pursue the Boer fugitives in case of a  British victory. This small detached column numbered about a thousand  men--whose fate will be afterwards narrated.    At five o'clock on the morning of the 30th the Boers, who had already  developed a perfect genius for hauling heavy cannon up the most  difficult heights, opened fire from one of the hills which lie to the  north of the town. Before the shot was fired, the forces of the British  had already streamed out of Ladysmith to test the strength of the  invaders.    White's army was divided into three columns. On the extreme left, quite  isolated from the others, was the small Nicholson's Nek detachment under  the command of Colonel Carleton of the Fusiliers (one of three gallant  brothers each of whom commands a British regiment). With him was Major  Adye of the staff. On the right British flank Colonel Grimwood commanded  a brigade composed of the 1st and 2nd battalions of the King's Royal  Rifles, the Leicesters, the Liverpools, and the Royal Dublin Fusiliers.  In the centre Colonel Ian Hamilton commanded the Devons, the Gordons,  the Manchesters, and the 2nd battalion of the Rifle Brigade, which  marched direct into the battle from the train which had brought them  from Durban. Six batteries of artillery were massed in the centre under  Colonel Downing. French with the cavalry and mounted infantry was on the  extreme right, but found little opportunity for the use of the mounted  arm that day.    The Boer position, so far as it could be seen, was a formidable one.  Their centre lay upon one of the spurs of Signal Hill, about three miles  from the town. Here they had two forty-pounders and three other lighter  guns, but their artillery strength developed both in numbers and in  weight of metal as the day wore on. Of their dispositions little could  be seen. An observer looking westward might discern with his glass  sprays of mounted riflemen galloping here and there over the downs,  and possibly small groups where the gunners stood by their guns, or the  leaders gazed down at that town which they were destined to have in view  for such a weary while. On the dun-coloured plains before the town, the  long thin lines, with an occasional shifting sparkle of steel, showed  where Hamilton's and Grimwood's infantry were advancing. In the clear  cold air of an African morning every detail could be seen, down to the  distant smoke of a train toiling up the heavy grades which lead from  Frere over the Colenso Bridge to Ladysmith.    The scrambling, inconsequential, unsatisfactory action which ensued is  as difficult to describe as it must have been to direct. The Boer  front covered some seven or eight miles, with kopjes, like chains of  fortresses, between. They formed a huge semicircle of which our advance  was the chord, and they were able from this position to pour in  a converging artillery fire which grew steadily hotter as the day  advanced. In the early part of the day our forty-two guns, working  furiously, though with a want of accuracy which may be due to those  errors of refraction which are said to be common in the limpid air of  the veld, preserved their superiority. There appears to have been a want  of concentration about our fire, and at some periods of the action  each particular battery was firing at some different point of the Boer  half-circle. Sometimes for an hour on end the Boer reply would die  away altogether, only to break out with augmented violence, and with  an accuracy which increased our respect for their training. Huge  shells--the largest that ever burst upon a battlefield--hurled from  distances which were unattainable by our fifteen-pounders, enveloped our  batteries in smoke and flame. One enormous Creusot gun on Pepworth Hill  threw a 96-pound shell a distance of four miles, and several 40-pound  howitzers outweighted our field guns. And on the same day on which we  were so roughly taught how large the guns were which labour and good  will could haul on to the field of battle, we learned also that our  enemy--to the disgrace of our Board of Ordnance be it recorded--was more  in touch with modern invention than we were, and could show us not only  the largest, but also the smallest, shell which had yet been used. Would  that it had been our officials instead of our gunners who heard the  devilish little one-pound shells of"]]]
