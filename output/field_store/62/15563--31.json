He ruled his diocese with the despotic zeal of a born  administrator. He threw himself into social work of every kind; he  organised charities, he lectured on temperance; he delivered innumerable  sermons; he produced an unending series of devotional books. And he  brooked no brother near the throne: Newman languished in Birmingham; and  even the Jesuits trembled and obeyed.    Nor was it only among his own community that his energy and his  experience found scope. He gradually came to play an important part in  public affairs, upon questions of labour, poverty, and education. He sat  on Royal Commissions and corresponded with Cabinet Ministers. At last,  no philanthropic meeting at the Guildhall was considered complete  without the presence of Cardinal Manning. A special degree of precedence  was accorded to him. Though the rank of a Cardinal-Archbishop is  officially unknown in England, his name appeared in public documents--as  a token, it must be supposed, of personal consideration--above the names  of peers and bishops, and immediately below that of the Prince of Wales.    In his private life he was secluded. The ambiguities of his social  position, and his desire to maintain intact the peculiar eminence of his  office, combined to hold him aloof from the ordinary gatherings of  society, though on the rare occasions of his appearance among  fashionable and exalted persons, he carried all before him. His  favourite haunt was the Athenaeum Club, where he sat scanning the  newspapers, or conversing with the old friends of former days. He was a  member, too, of that distinguished body, the Metaphysical Society, which  met once a month during the palmy years of the seventies to discuss, in  strict privacy, the fundamental problems of the destiny of man.    After a comfortable dinner at the Grosvenor Hotel, the Society, which  included Professor Huxley and Professor Tyndall, Mr. John Morley and Sir  James Stephen, the Duke of Argyll, Lord Tennyson, and Dean Church, would  gather around to hear and discuss a paper read by one of the members  upon such questions as: 'What is death?' 'Is God unknowable?' or 'The  nature of the Moral Principle'. Sometimes, however, the speculations of  the Society ranged in other directions.    'I think the paper that interested me most of all that were ever read at  our meetings,' says Sir Mountstuart Elphinstone Grant-Duff, 'was one on  \"Wherein consists the special beauty of imperfection and decay?\" in  which were propounded the questions \"Are not ruins recognised and felt  to be more beautiful than perfect structures? Why are they so? Ought  they to be so?'    'Unfortunately, however, the answers given to these questions by the  Metaphysical Society have not been recorded for the instruction of  mankind.    Manning read several papers, and Professor Huxley and Mr. John Morley  listened with attention while he expressed his views upon 'The Soul  before and after Death', or explained why it is 'That legitimate  Authority is an Evidence of Truth'. Yet, somehow or other, his Eminence  never felt quite at ease in these assemblies; he was more at home with  audiences of a different kind; and we must look in other directions for  the free and full manifestation of his speculative gifts.    In a series of lectures, for instance, delivered in 1861--it was the  first year of the unification of Italy--upon 'The Present Crisis of the  Holy See, tested by prophecy', we catch some glimpses of the kind of  problems which were truly congenial to his mind.    'In the following pages,' he said, 'I have endeavoured, but for so great  a subject most insufficiently, to show that what is passing in our times  is the prelude of the antichristian period of the final dethronement of  Christendom, and of the restoration of society without God in the  world.' 'My intention is,' he continued, 'to examine the present  relation of the Church to the civil powers of the world by the light of  a prophecy recorded by St Paul.'    This prophecy (2 Thess. ii 3 to 11) is concerned with the coming of the  Antichrist, and the greater part of the lectures is devoted to a minute  examination of this subject. There is no passage in Scripture, Manning  pointed out, relating to the coming of Christ more explicit and express  than those foretelling Antichrist; it therefore behoved the faithful to  consider the matter more fully than they are wont to do. In the first  place, Antichrist is a person. 'To deny the personality of Antichrist is  to deny the plain testimony of Holy Scripture.' And we must remember  that 'it is a law of Holy Scripture that when persons are prophesied of,  persons appear'.    Again, there was every reason to believe that Antichrist, when he did  appear, would turn out to be a Jew.    'Such was the opinion of St. Irenaeus, St. Jerome, and of the author of  the work De Consummatione Mundi, ascribed to St. Hippolytus, and of a  writer of a Commentary on the Epistle to the Thessalonians, ascribed to  St. Ambrose, of many others, who said that he will be of the tribe of  Dan: as, for instance, St. Gregory the Great, Theodoret, Aretas of  Caesarea, and many more. Such also is the opinion of Bellarmine, who  calls it certain. Lessius affirms that the Fathers, with unanimous  consent, teach as undoubted that Antichrist will be a Jew. Ribera  repeats the same opinion, and adds that Aretas, St. Bede, Haymo, St.  Anselm, and Rupert affirm that for this reason the tribe of Dan is not  numbered among those who are sealed in the Apocalypse ... Now, I think  no one can consider the dispersion and providential preservation of the  Jews among all the nations of the world and the indestructible vitality  of their race without believing that they are reserved for some future  action of His judgment and Grace. And this is foretold again and again  in the New Testament.'    'Our Lord,' continued Manning, widening the sweep of his speculations,  'has said of these latter times: \"There shall arise false Christs and  false prophets, insomuch as to deceive even the elect\"; that is, they  shall not be deceived; but those who have lost faith in the Incarnation,  such as humanitarians, rationalists, and pantheists, may well be  deceived by any person of great political power and success, who should  restore the Jews to their own land, and people Jerusalem once more with  the sons of the Patriarchs. And, there is nothing in the political  aspect of the world which renders such a combination impossible; indeed,  the state of Syria, and the tide of European diplomacy, which 'is  continually moving eastward, render such an event within a reasonable  probability.'    Then Manning threw out a bold suggestion. 'A successful medium,' he  said, 'might well pass himself off by his preternatural endowments as  the promised Messiahs.'    Manning went on to discuss the course of events which would lead to the  final catastrophe. But this subject, he confessed,    'deals with agencies so transcendent and mysterious, that all I shall  venture to do will be to sketch in outline what the broad and luminous  prophecies, especially of the Book of Daniel and the Apocalypse, set  forth without attempting to enter into minute details, which can only be  interpreted by the event'.    While applauding his modesty, we need follow Manning no further in his  commentary upon those broad and luminous works; except to observe that  'the apostasy of the City of Rome from the Vicar of Christ and its  destruction by the Antichrist' was, in his opinion, certain. Nor was he  without authority for this belief. For it was held by 'Malvenda, who  writes expressly on the subject', and who, besides, 'states as the  opinion of Ribera, Gaspar Melus, Viegas, Suarez, Bellarmine, and Bosius  that Rome shall apostatise from the faith'.      IX    THE death of Pius IX brought to Manning a last flattering testimony of  the confidence with which he was regarded at the Court of Rome. In one  of the private consultations preceding the Conclave, a Cardinal  suggested that Manning should succeed to the Papacy. He replied that he  was unfit for the position, because it was essential for the interests  of the Holy See that the next Pope should be an Italian. The suggestion  was pressed, but Manning held firm. Thus it happened that the Triple  Tiara seemed to come, for a moment, within the grasp of the late  Archdeacon of Chichester; and the cautious hand refrained.    Leo XIII was elected, and there was a great change in the policy of the  Vatican. Liberalism became the order of the day. And now at last the  opportunity seemed ripe for an act which, in the opinion of the majority  of English Catholics, had long been due--the bestowal of some mark of  recognition from the Holy See upon the labours and the sanctity of  Father Newman. It was felt that a Cardinal's hat was the one fitting  reward for such a life, and accordingly the Duke of Norfolk,  representing the Catholic laity of England, visited Manning, and  suggested that he should forward the proposal to the Vatican. Manning  agreed, and then there followed a curious series of incidents--the last  encounter in the jarring lives of those two men. A letter was drawn up  by Manning for the eye of the Pope, embodying the Duke of Norfolk's  proposal; but there was an unaccountable delay in the transmission of  this letter; months passed, and it had not reached the Holy Father. The  whole matter would, perhaps, have dropped out of sight and been  forgotten, in a way which had become customary when honours for Newman  were concerned, had not the Duke of Norfolk himself, when he was next in  Rome, ventured to recommend to Leo XIII that Dr. Newman should be made a  Cardinal. His Holiness welcomed the proposal; but, he said, he could do  nothing until he knew the views of Cardinal Manning. Thereupon, the Duke  of Norfolk wrote to Manning,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2449"],[0,"The Common Law (#20)"],[1,"established exceptions  to the general prohibition against entering another's premises,  as in the instance put by Chief Justice Choke in the Year Book,  of a tree being blown over upon them, or when the highway became  impassable, or for the purpose of keeping the peace. /2/    Another example may perhaps be found in the shape which has been  given in modern times to the liability for animals, and in the  derivative principle of Rylands v. Fletcher, /3/ that when a  person brings on his lands, and collects and keeps there,  anything likely to do mischief if it escapes, he must keep it in  at his peril; and, if he does not do so, is prima facie  answerable for all the [117] damage which is the natural  consequence of its escape. Cases of this sort do not stand on the  notion that it is wrong to keep cattle, or to have a reservoir of  water, as might have been thought with more plausibility when  fierce and useless animals only were in question. /1/ It may even  be very much for the public good that the dangerous accumulation  should be made (a consideration which might influence the  decision in some instances, and differently in different  jurisdictions); but as there is a limit to the nicety of inquiry  which is possible in a trial, it may be considered that the  safest way to secure care is to throw the risk upon the person  who decides what precautions shall be taken. The liability for  trespasses of cattle seems to lie on the boundary line between  rules based on policy irrespective of fault, and requirements  intended to formulate the conduct of a prudent man.    It has been shown in the first Lecture how this liability for  cattle arose in the early law, and how far the influence of early  notions might be traced in the law of today, Subject to what is  there said, it is evident that the early discussions turn on the  general consideration whether the owner is or is not to blame.  /2/ But they do not stop there: they go on to take practical  distinctions, based on common experience. Thus, when the  defendant chased sheep out of his land with a dog, and as soon as  the sheep were out called in his dog, but the dog pursued them  into adjoining land, the chasing of the sheep beyond the  defendant's line was held no trespass, because \"the nature of a  dog is such that he cannot be ruled suddenly.\" /3/    [118] It was lawful in ploughing to turn the horses on adjoining  land, and if while so turning the beasts took a mouthful of  grass, or subverted the soil with the plough, against the will of  the driver, he had a good justification, because the law will  recognize that a man cannot at every instant govern his cattle as  he will. /1/ So it was said that, if a man be driving cattle  through a town, and one of them goes into another man's house,  and he follows him, trespass does not lie for this. /2/ So it was  said by Doderidge, J., in the same case, that if deer come into  my land out of the forest, and I chase them with dogs, it is  excuse enough for me to wind my horn to recall the dogs, because  by this the warden of the forest has notice that a deer is being  chased. /3/    The very case of Mason v. Keeling, /4/ which is referred to in  the first Lecture for its echo of primitive notions, shows that  the working rules of the law had long been founded on good sense.  With regard to animals not then treated as property, which in the  main were the wilder animals, the law was settled that, \"if they  are of a tame nature, there must be notice of the ill quality;  and the law takes notice, that a dog is not of a fierce nature,  but rather the contrary.\" /5/ If the animals \"are such as are  naturally [119] mischievous in their kind, he shall answer for  hurt done by them, without any notice.\" /1/ The latter principle  has been applied to the case of a bear, /2/ and amply accounts  for the liability of the owner of such animals as horses and oxen  in respect of trespasses upon land, although, as has been seen,  it was at one time thought to stand upon his ownership. It is  said to be the universal nature of cattle to stray, and, when  straying in cultivated land, to do damage by trampling down and  eating the crops, whereas a dog does no harm. It is also said to  be usual and easy to restrain them. /3/ If, as has been  suggested, the historical origin of the rule was different, it  does not matter.    Following the same line of thought, the owner of cattle is not  held absolutely answerable for all damage which they may do the  person. According to Lord Holt in the alcove opinion, these  animals, \"which are not so familiar to mankind\" as dogs, \"the  owner ought to confine, and take all reasonable caution that they  do no mischief.... But... if the owner puts a horse or an ox to  grass in his field, which is adjoining to the highway, and the  horse or the ox breaks the hedge and runs into the highway, and  kicks or gores some passenger, an action will not lie against the  owner; otherwise, if he had notice that they had done such a  thing before.\"    [120] Perhaps the most striking authority for the position that  the judge's duties are not at an end when the question of  negligence is reached, is shown by the discussions concerning the  law of bailment. Consider the judgment in Coggs v. Bernard, /1/  the treatises of Sir William Jones and Story, and the chapter of  Kent upon the subject. They are so many attempts to state the  duty of the bailee specifically, according to the nature of the  bailment and of the object bailed. Those attempts, to be sure,  were not successful, partly because they were attempts to engraft  upon the native stock a branch of the Roman law which was too  large to survive the process, but more especially because the  distinctions attempted were purely qualitative, and were  therefore useless when dealing with a jury. /2/ To instruct a  jury that they must find the defendant guilty of gross negligence  before he can be charged, is open to the reproach that for such a  body the word \"gross\" is only a vituperative epithet. But it  would not be so with a judge sitting in admiralty without a jury.  The Roman law and the Supreme Court of the United States agree  that the word means something. /3/ Successful or not, it is  enough for the present argument that the attempt has been made.    The principles of substantive law which have been established by  the courts are believed to have been somewhat obscured by having  presented themselves oftenest in the form of rulings upon the  sufficiency of evidence. When a judge rules that there is no  evidence of negligence, he does something more than is embraced  in an ordinary ruling that there is no evidence of a fact. He  rules that [121] acts or omissions proved or in question do not  constitute a ground of legal liability, and in this way the law  is gradually enriching itself from daily life, as it should.  Thus, in Crafton v. Metropolitan Railway Co., /1/ the plaintiff  slipped on the defendant's stairs and was severely hurt. The  cause of his slipping was that the brass nosing of the stairs had  been worn smooth by travel over it, and a builder testified that  in his opinion the staircase was unsafe by reason of this  circumstance and the absence of a hand-rail. There was nothing to  contradict this except that great numbers of persons had passed  over the stairs and that no accident had happened there, and the  plaintiff had a verdict. The court set the verdict aside, and  ordered a nonsuit. The ruling was in form that there was no  evidence of negligence to go to the jury; but this was obviously  equivalent to saying, and did in fact mean, that the railroad  company had done all that it was bound to do in maintaining such  a staircase as was proved by the plaintiff. A hundred other  equally concrete instances will be found in the text-books.    On the other hand, if the court should rule that certain acts or  omissions coupled with damage were conclusive evidence of  negligence unless explained, it would, in substance and in truth,  rule that such acts or omissions were a ground of liability, /2/  or prevented a recovery, as the case might be. Thus it is said to  be actionable negligence to let a house for a dwelling knowing it  to be so infected with small-pox as to be dangerous to health,  and concealing the knowledge. /3/ To explain the acts or  omissions in such a [122] case would be to prove different  conduct from that ruled upon, or to show that they were not,  juridically speaking, the cause of the damage complained of. The  ruling assumes, for the purposes of the ruling, that the facts in  evidence are all the facts.    The cases which have raised difficulties needing explanation are  those in which the court has ruled that there was prima facie  evidence of negligence, or some evidence of negligence to go to  the jury.    Many have noticed the confusion of thought implied in speaking of  such cases as presenting mixed questions of law and fact. No  doubt, as has been said above, the averment that the defendant  has been guilty of negligence is a complex one: first, that he  has done or omitted certain things; second, that his alleged  conduct does not come up to the legal standard. And so long as  the controversy is simply on the first half, the whole complex  averment is plain matter for the jury without special  instructions, just as a question of ownership would be where the  only dispute was as to the fact upon which the legal conclusion  was founded. /1/ But when a controversy arises on the second  half, the question whether the court or the jury ought to judge  of the defendant's conduct is wholly unaffected by the accident,  whether there is or is not also a dispute as to what that conduct  was. If there is such a dispute, it is entirely possible to give  a series of hypothetical instructions adapted to every state of  facts which it is open to the jury to find. If there is no such  dispute, the court may still"]]]
