His  lighter cimeter blade he flung aside before he had done, and, toward the  last, brandished a sword that had weight as well as edge and temper. The  skill that could halve a feather in the air with the sword of Saladin  was proved to be also strength that could cleave a suit of mail with the  brand of Richard the Lion-hearted.    It is universally acknowledged, that the French language has never in  any hands been a more obedient instrument of intellectual power than it  was in the hands of Pascal. He is rated the earliest writer to produce  what may be called the final French prose. \"The creator of French  style,\" Villemain boldly calls him. Pascal's style remains to this day  almost perfectly free from adhesions of archaism in diction and in  construction. Pascal showed, as it were at once, what the French  language was capable of doing in response to the demands of a master. It  was the joint achievement of genius, of taste, and of skill, working  together in an exquisite balance and harmony.    But let us be entirely frank. The \"Provincial Letters\" of Pascal are  now, to the general reader, not so interesting as from their fame one  would seem entitled to expect. You cannot read them intelligently  without considerable previous study. You need to have learned,  imperfectly, with labor, a thousand things that every contemporary  reader of Pascal perfectly knew, as if by simply breathing,--the  necessary knowledge being then, so to speak, abroad in the air. Even  thus, you cannot possibly derive that vivid delight from perusing in  bulk the \"Provincial Letters\" now, which the successive numbers of the  series, appearing at brief irregular intervals, communicated to the  eagerly expecting French public, at a time when the topics discussed  were topics of a present and pressing practical interest. Still, with  whatever disadvantage unavoidably attending, we must give our readers a  taste of the quality of Pascal's \"Provincial Letters.\"    We select a passage at the commencement of the Seventh Letter. We use  the translation of Mr. Thomas M'Crie. This succeeds very well in  conveying the sense, though it necessarily fails to convey either the  vivacity or the eloquence, of the incomparable original. The first  occasion of the \"Provincial Letters\" was a championship proposed to  Pascal to be taken up by him on behalf of his beleaguered and endangered  friend Arnauld, the Port-Royalist. (Port Royal was a Roman-Catholic  abbey, situated some eight miles to the south-west of Versailles, and  therefore not very remote from Paris.) Arnauld was \"for substance of  doctrine\" really a Calvinist, though he quite sincerely disclaimed being  such; and it was for his defence of Calvinism (under its ancient form of  Augustinianism) that he was threatened, through Jesuit enmity, with  condemnation for heretical opinion. The problem was to enlist the  sentiment of general society in his favor. The friends in council at  Port Royal said to Pascal, \"You must do this.\" Pascal said, \"I will  try.\" In a few days, the first letter of a series destined to such fame,  was submitted for judgment to Port Royal and approved. It was  printed--anonymously. The success was instantaneous and brilliant. A  second letter followed, and a third. Soon, from strict personal defence  of Arnauld, the writer went on to take up a line of offence and  aggression. He carried the war into Africa. He attacked the Jesuits as  teachers of immoral doctrine.    The plan of these later letters was, to have a Paris gentleman write to  a friend of his in the country (the \"provincial\"), detailing interviews  held by him with a Jesuit priest of the city. The supposed Parisian  gentleman, in his interviews with the supposed Jesuit father, affects  the air of a very simple-hearted seeker after truth. He represents  himself as, by his innocent-seeming docility, leading his Jesuit teacher  on to make the most astonishingly frank exposures of the secrets of the  casuistical system held and taught by his order.    The Seventh Letter tells the story of how Jesuit confessors were  instructed to manage their penitents in a matter made immortally famous  by the wit and genius of Pascal, the matter of \"directing the  intention.\" There is nothing in the \"Provincial Letters\" better suited  than this at the same time to interest the general reader, and to  display the quality of these renowned productions. (We do not scruple to  change our chosen translation a little, at points where it seems to us  susceptible of some easy improvement.) Remember it is an imaginary  Parisian gentleman who now writes to a friend of his in the country:--         \"You know,\" he said, \"that the ruling passion of persons in that       rank of life [the rank of gentleman] is 'the point of honor,' which       is perpetually driving them into acts of violence apparently quite       at variance with Christian piety; so that, in fact, they would be       almost all of them excluded from our confessionals, had not our       fathers relaxed a little from the strictness of religion, to       accommodate themselves to the weakness of humanity. Anxious to keep       on good terms, both with the gospel, by doing their duty to God,       and with the men of the world, by showing charity to their       neighbor, they needed all the wisdom they possessed to devise       expedients for so nicely adjusting matters as to permit these       gentlemen to adopt the methods usually resorted to for vindicating       their honor without wounding their consciences, and thus reconcile       things apparently so opposite to each other as piety and the point       of honor.\"...         \"I should certainly [so replies M. Montalte, with the most       exquisite irony couched under a cover of admiring simplicity],--I       should certainly have considered the thing perfectly impracticable,       if I had not known, from what I have seen of your fathers, that       they are capable of doing with ease what is impossible to other       men. This led me to anticipate that they must have discovered some       method for meeting the difficulty,--a method which I admire, even       before knowing it, and which I pray you to explain to me.\"         \"Since that is your view of the matter,\" replied the monk, \"I       cannot refuse you. Know, then, that this marvellous principle is       our grand method of _directing the intention_--the importance of       which, in our moral system, is such, that I might almost venture to       compare it with the doctrine of probability. You have had some       glimpses of it in passing, from certain maxims which I mentioned to       you. For example, when I was showing you how servants might execute       certain troublesome jobs with a safe conscience, did you not remark       that it was simply by diverting their intention from the evil to       which they were accessory, to the profit which they might reap from       the transaction? Now, that is what we call _directing the       intention_. You saw, too, that, were it not for a similar       divergence of _the mind_, those who give money for benefices might       be downright simoniacs. But I will now show you this grand method       in all its glory, as it applies to the subject of homicide,--a       crime which it justifies in a thousand instances,--in order that,       from this startling result, you may form an idea of all that it is       calculated to effect.\"         \"I foresee already,\" said I, \"that, according to this mode, every       thing will be permitted: it will stick at nothing.\"         \"You always fly from the one extreme to the other,\" replied the       monk; \"prithee avoid that habit. For just to show you that we are       far from permitting every thing, let me tell you that we never       suffer such a thing as a formal intention to sin, with the sole       design of sinning; and, if any person whatever should persist in       having no other end but evil in the evil that he does, we break       with him at once; such conduct is diabolical. This holds true,       without exception of age, sex, or rank. But when the person is not       of such a wretched disposition as this, we try to put in practice       our method of _directing the intention_, which consists in his       proposing to himself, as the end of his actions, some allowable       object. Not that we do not endeavor, as far as we can, to dissuade       men from doing things forbidden; but, when we cannot prevent the       action, we at least purify the motive, and thus correct the       viciousness of the mean by the goodness of the end. Such is the way       in which our fathers have contrived to permit those acts of       violence to which men usually resort in vindication of their honor.       They have no more to do than to turn off their intention from the       desire of vengeance, which is criminal, and direct it to a desire       to defend their honor, which, according to us, is quite       warrantable. And in this way our doctors discharge all their duty       towards God and towards man. By permitting the action, they gratify       the world; and by purifying the intention, they give satisfaction       to the gospel. This is a secret, sir, which was entirely unknown to       the ancients; the world is indebted for the discovery entirely to       our doctors. You understand it now, I hope?\"         \"Perfectly,\" was my reply. \"To men you grant the outward material       effect of the action, and to God you give the inward and spiritual       movement of the intention; and, by this equitable partition, you       form an alliance between the laws of God and the laws of men. But,       my dear sir, to be frank with you, I can hardly trust your       premises, and I suspect that your"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2306"],[0,"Uncle Remus, His Songs and His Sayings (#20)"],[1,"of alarm; \"hol' on dar!
