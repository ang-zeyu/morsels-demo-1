While her eyes were thus occupied, a voice addressed her, though  she saw no one, uttering these words: \"Sovereign lady, all that  you see is yours.  We whose voices you hear are your servants,  and shall obey all your commands with our utmost care and  diligence.  Retire therefore to your chamber and repose on your  bed of down, and when you see fit repair to the bath.  Supper  will await you in the adjoining alcove when it pleases you to  take your seat there.\"    Psyche gave ear to the admonitions of her vocal attendants, and  after repose and the refreshment of the bath, seated herself in  the alcove, where a table immediately presented itself, without  any visible aid from waiters or servants, and covered with the  greatest delicacies of food and the most nectareous wines.  Her  ears too were feasted with music from invisible performers; of  whom one sang, another played on the lute, and all closed in the  wonderful harmony of a full chorus.    She had not yet seen her destined husband.  He came only in the  hours of darkness, and fled before the dawn of morning, but his  accents were full of love, and inspired a like passion in her.  She often begged him to stay and let her behold him, but he would  not consent.  On the contrary, he charged her to make no attempt  to see him, for it was his pleasure, for the best of reasons, to  keep concealed.  \"Why should you wish to behold me?\" he said.  \"Have you any doubt of my love?  Have you any wish ungratified?  If you saw me, perhaps you would fear me, perhaps adore me, but  all I ask of you is to love me.  I would rather you would love me  as an equal than adore me as a god.\"    This reasoning somewhat quieted Psyche for a time, and while the  novelty lasted she felt quite happy.  But at length the thought  of her parents, left in ignorance of her fate, and of her  sisters, precluded from sharing with her the delights of her  situation, preyed on her mind and made her begin to feel her  palace as but a splendid prison.  When her husband came one  night, she told him her distress, and at last drew from him an  unwilling consent that her sisters should be brought to see her.    So calling Zephyr, she acquainted him with her husband's  commands, and he, promptly obedient, soon brought them across the  mountain down to their sister's valley.  They embraced her and  she returned their caresses.  \"Come,\" said Psyche, \"enter with me  my house and refresh yourselves with whatever your sister has to  offer.\"  Then taking their hands she led them into her golden  palace, and committed them to the care of her numerous train of  attendant voices, to refresh them in her baths and at her table,  and to show them all her treasures.  The view of these celestial  delights caused envy to enter their bosoms, at seeing their young  sister possessed of such state and splendor, so much exceeding  their own.    They asked her numberless questions, among others what sort of a  person her husband was.  Psyche replied that he was a beautiful  youth, who generally spent the daytime in hunting upon the  mountains.  The sisters, not satisfied with this reply, soon made  her confess that she had never seen him.  Then they proceeded to  fill her bosom with dark suspicions.  \"Call to mind,\" they said,  \"the Pythian oracle that declared you destined to marry a direful  and tremendous monster.  The inhabitants of this valley say that  your husband is a terrible and monstrous serpent, who nourishes  you for a while with dainties that he may by and by devour you.  Take our advice.  Provide yourself with a lamp and a sharp knife;  put them in concealment that your husband may not discover them,  and when he is sound asleep, slip out of bed bring forth your  lamp and see for yourself whether what they say is true or not.  If it is, hesitate not to cut off the monster's head, and thereby  recover your liberty.\"    Psyche resisted these persuasions as well as she could, but they  did not fail to have their effect on her mind, and when her  sisters were gone, their words and her own curiosity were too  strong for her to resist.  So she prepared her lamp and a sharp  knife, and hid them out of sight of her husband.  When he had  fallen into his first sleep, she silently rose and uncovering her  lamp beheld not a hideous monster, but the most beautiful and  charming of the gods, with his golden ringlets wandering over his  snowy neck and crimson cheek, with two dewy wings on his  shoulders, whiter than snow, and with shining feathers like the  tender blossoms of spring.  As she leaned the lamp over to have a  nearer view of his face a drop of burning oil fell on the  shoulder of the god, startled with which he opened his eyes and  fixed them full upon her; then, without saying one word, he  spread his white wings and flew out of the window.  Psyche, in  vain endeavoring to follow him, fell from the window to the  ground.  Cupid, beholding her as she lay in the dust, stopped his  flight for an instant and said, \"O foolish Psyche, is it thus you  repay my love?  After having disobeyed my mother's commands and  made you my wife, will you think me a monster and cut off my  head?  But go; return to your sisters, whose advice you seem to  think preferable to mine.  I inflict no other punishment on you  than to leave you forever.  Love cannot dwell with suspicion.\"  So saying he fled away, leaving poor Psyche prostrate on the  ground, filling the place with mournful lamentations.    When she had recovered some degree of composure she looked around  her, but the palace and gardens had vanished, and she found  herself in the open field not far from the city where her sisters  dwelt.  She repaired thither and told them the whole story of her  misfortunes, at which, pretending to grieve, those spiteful  creatures inwardly rejoiced; \"for now,\" said they, \"he will  perhaps choose one of us.\"  With this idea, without saying a word  of her intentions, each of them rose early the next morning and  ascended the mountain, and having reached the top, called upon  Zephyr to receive her and bear her to his lord; then leaping up,  and not being sustained by Zephyr, fell down the precipice and  was dashed to pieces.    Psyche meanwhile wandered day and night, without food or repose,  in search of her husband.  Casting her eyes on a lofty mountain  having on its brow a magnificent temple, she sighed and said to  herself, \"Perhaps my love, my lord, inhabits there,\" and directed  her steps thither.    She had no sooner entered than she saw heaps of corn, some in  loose ears and some in sheaves, with mingled ears of barley.  Scattered about lay sickles and rakes, and all the instruments of  harvest, without order, as if thrown carelessly out of the weary  reapers' hands in the sultry hours of the day.    This unseemly confusion the pious Psyche put an end to, by  separating and sorting every thing to its proper place and kind,  believing that she ought to neglect none of the gods, but  endeavor by her piety to engage them all in her behalf.  The holy  Ceres, whose temple it was, finding her so religiously employed,  thus spoke to her: \"O Psyche, truly worthy of our pity, though I  cannot shield you from the frowns of Venus, yet I can teach you  how best to allay her displeasure.  Go then, voluntarily  surrender yourself to your lady and sovereign, and try by modesty  and submission to win her forgiveness; perhaps her favor will  restore you the husband you have lost.\"    Psyche obeyed the commands of Ceres and took her way to the  temple of Venus, endeavoring to fortify her mind and thinking of  what she should say and how she should best propitiate the angry  goddess, feeling that the issue was doubtful and perhaps fatal.    Venus received her with angry countenance.  \"Most undutiful and  faithless of servants,\" said she, \"do you at last remember that  you really have a mistress?  Or have you rather come to see your  sick husband, yet suffering from the wound given him by his  loving wife?  You are so ill-favored and disagreeable that the  only way you can merit your lover must be by dint of industry and  diligence.  I will make trial of your housewifery.\"  Then she  ordered Psyche to be led to the storehouse of her temple, where  was laid up a great quantity of wheat, barley, millet, vetches,  beans, and lentils prepared for food for her doves, and said,  \"Take and separate all these grains, putting all of the same kind  in a parcel by themselves, and see that you get it done before  evening.\"  Then Venus departed and left her to her task.    But Psyche, in perfect consternation at the enormous work, sat  stupid and silent, without moving a finger to the inextricable  heap.    While she sat despairing, Cupid stirred up the little ant, a  native of the fields, to take compassion on her.  The leader of  the ant-hill, followed by whole hosts of his six-legged subjects,  approached the heap, and with the utmost diligence taking grain  by grain, they separated the pile, sorting each kind to its  parcel; and when it was all done, they vanished out of sight in a  moment.    Venus at the approach of twilight returned from the banquet of  the gods, breathing odors and crowned with roses.  Seeing the  task done she exclaimed, \"This is no work of yours wicked one,  but his, whom to your own and his misfortune you have enticed.\"  So saying, she threw her a piece of black bread for her supper  and went away.    Next morning Venus ordered Psyche to be called, and said to her,  \"Behold yonder grove which stretches along the margin of the  water.  There you will find sheep feeding without a shepherd,  with golden-shining fleeces on their backs.  Go, fetch me a  sample of that precious wool gathered from every one of their  fleeces.    Psyche obediently went to the river-side, prepared to do her best  to execute the command.  But the river-god inspired the reeds  with harmonious murmurs, which seemed to say, \"O "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33407"],[0,"Bee and Butterfly: A Tale of Two Cousins (#20)"],[1,"Adele looked with her golden hair; how delicate and pearly  was her lovely neck; what sweet eyes were hers, blue as a sky full of  sunshine. Doctor Raymond's glance dwelt upon her with admiration.    \"What a lovely girl you are!\" he exclaimed voluntarily. Adele colored  with pleasure.    \"I did not think that you saw beauty in anything but your butterflies,\"  she said archly.    \"Indeed I do. I am very susceptible to beauty in any form. But surely  you also see beauty in this?\" He handed her a frame in which was mounted  a gorgeous Scarlet Admiral. \"Is not this strikingly beautiful? Note with  what a brilliant red the secondaries are bordered, and the velvety  blackness of the fore wings. It is among the last of our hibernating  butterflies to seek its winter quarters, and is most interesting in many  ways.\"    \"It is beautiful,\" cried Adele with enthusiasm. \"Oh! it just makes me  want to study butterflies too when I see such pretty ones.\"    \"I do not wonder that the old Greeks used the butterfly as an emblem of  the soul,\" commented the Lepidopterist, well pleased with her  appreciation of the insect. \"Even as the imago bursts from its chrysalis  and, throwing aside the bonds that held it a lowly creeping thing to  earth, mounts upward on gauzy wings, so the soul casts off its  earth-bound body at length and also mounts upward on wings of hope. The  symbol of the butterfly is found on all their tombs and monuments.\"    \"It is a pretty thought,\" commented his niece sweetly, \"but you don't  know how anxious I am to hear about Sir Joseph Banks and The Emperor.\"    \"To be sure,\" ejaculated Doctor Raymond hastily. \"I had forgotten.\"  Then, in a rich voice of no little charm, he recited the ode. Adele  laughed merrily as he finished.    \"How can you bear to repeat anything like that when it is a take-off on  scientists?\" she asked.    \"We can appreciate humor even when it is at our expense, child. Now  let's go to lunch. You girls may then visit Rachel while I go into the  town. I must look after some matters of Henry's. I will join you as you  leave the woods coming back from Rachel's. On our way home we will call  upon our new neighbors. I am curious about that prodigy of whom Beatrice  was speaking. Then, too, I wish to see if they will be pleasant  acquaintances for you. If they are it would not be so lonesome for you  girls should I be called from home, as it sometimes happens that I am.\"    Bee sighed as they went to the dining room. He spoke exactly as though  Adele was always to be with them. She had felt a little out of things  that morning, and perhaps her manner held the slightest tinge of  asperity. Adele ran at once to the head of the table.    \"I want to pour the coffee today, Bee,\" she cried, her white hands  fluttering among the cups like flower petals.    \"No;\" spoke Bee emphatically, pushing her to one side. \"That is _my_  duty, Adele.\"    \"Beatrice,\" exclaimed her father, \"I am surprised. What difference does  it make? If your cousin wishes to pour the coffee, let her do so.  Remember, she is your guest.\" So he spoke, for no man ever understands  all that serving at her own table means to a woman, or girl child.    \"I do remember, father. She is the one who forgets. As hostess this is  my place, and I will not give it up to any one.\"    \"'Will not' are strong words, my daughter. What if I were to command  you?\"    \"Then I should have to obey you, father.\" The girl found herself  trembling with anger. \"But you, sir, would be forgetting what was due  to your daughter.\"    \"You are impertinent, Beatrice,\" he remarked coldly. \"There are times  when your manner leaves much to be desired.\"    \"I would just as soon sit here, Uncle William,\" broke in Adele. \"It was  just a notion of mine. I didn't dream that Bee would care. It does not  matter in the least.\"    \"Thank you, my dear.\" The doctor's eyes softened. He was displeased that  his daughter should exhibit such outbursts of temper, as she  occasionally gave way to, and his formality toward her during the meal  made his disapprobation quite apparent.    Bee was aware that she had placed herself in the wrong by losing her  temper, and her hands shook so that she could scarcely hold the cups.    \"Oh, I wish I didn't act this way,\" she thought remorsefully. \"It is so  hard to do the right thing when he shows his preference so plainly. Why  couldn't I have been nicer about this? It really is my place to sit  here, but I might have said so without getting mad. Oh, dear, dear!\"    The lunch ended, and the girls went upstairs to get ready for the  outing. When Bee was nearly dressed Adele came to her softly. She could  not bear that anyone should not be pleased with her, and she knew that  Bee was hurt and offended. Stepping behind her she put her arms around  her waist as Bee stood before the mirror, and bent her head over her  cousin's shoulder, partly that she might kiss her cheek, partly also  that she might see her face in the glass and contrast it with that of  Bee.    \"Don't be cross with me,\" she said coaxingly. \"I am sorry if I have done  anything that you did not like.\"    Beatrice sighed. Adele was irresistible in this mood.    \"Perhaps you did not mean it, Adele,\" she said. \"But, honestly! would  you like it if someone were to come to your house, and want to take your  place with your father and mother?\"    \"No, I would not,\" answered Adele candidly. \"What's the use of supposing  anything of the sort? Nobody could, you know. Papa and mamma would not  let them.\"    \"That is true,\" agreed Bee thoughtfully. \"Nobody could take your place,  Adele. I wish that father were so fond of me that no one could take my  place with him.\"    \"Maybe he will when he knows you better,\" remarked Adele consolingly.  \"Only you must not blame me if he likes me best.\" She loosened her hold  on Bee and wandered about the room, looking first at one thing, and then  another. Presently she gave a little scream of delight. \"What a pretty  hat!\" she cried. \"All white lace and pansies. Oh, Bee! Where did you get  it?\"    \"I got it when I bleached my hair,\" said Bee in a low tone. \"It is a  pretty hat. Every one likes it.\"    \"It's lovely,\" declared Adele, putting it on, and gazing rapturously at  her image in the glass. \"Doesn't it become me?\"    \"Everything becomes you, Adele, but this doesn't look any better on you  than your own.\" Bee reached out her hand for the hat. \"We must hurry.  Father doesn't like to be kept waiting.\"    \"Do let me wear it, Bee.\" Adele danced out of her cousin's reach. \"Just  see how nice it looks on me.\"    \"I want to wear it myself, Adele. I want to look well when we go to  Mrs. Medulla's.\"    \"Don't be so selfish, Bee. You used not to be. You used to let me wear  anything of yours that I wanted. What in the world has come to you? It  doesn't make any difference what you wear.\"    \"I don't think it's selfish for me to want to wear my own things,\"  answered Bee with tears in her eyes. \"You are not contented to let me  keep anything. You have just as many pretty things as I have; yet you  always want mine too.\"    \"You are so superior to such things,\" remarked Adele, her lip quivering,  her face wearing the tiniest aggrieved expression. \"Nobody thinks of  what you have on, but a poor little goosey like me has to be so careful.  I won't wear the hat, if you don't want me to; but I think you might let  me. You are getting awfully selfish.\"    Bee turned from her quickly and looked out of the window. Was she  selfish? It was true that formerly she had not minded letting Adele wear  her things. Why should she care now? A remembrance of Mrs. Medulla's  words came to her: \"A winsome and lovable personality is worth all the  beauty in the world.\" After all, why should she permit a mere hat to  upset her temper, and spoil her afternoon?    \"You may wear it, Adele,\" she said. \"It does become you.\"    \"You're a dear!\" Adele ran to the glass to pin on the hat securely.  \"What does a clever thing like you care about what you wear? You have a  mind above clothes.\"    \"Yes; I dare say,\" remarked Bee abstractedly. \"Are you ready to go down  now?\"    Doctor Raymond was waiting for them, and they set forth. The air under  the great trees that bordered the road was balmy. The hot July sun  brought out the cool sweet smell of the leaves. Gleams of fire fell  through the boughs and dappled the soil at intervals. On these sunflakes  numerous fritillary butterflies with silver under wings were fluttering,  and countless flies were humming. Presently Adele darted aside with an  exclamation.    \"It's a dead butterfly,\" she cried, holding the insect up to view. \"It  was sitting so still on the thistle that I thought it was asleep. And  the poor little thing was dead all the time.\"    \"It's shamming,\" said Doctor Raymond with a laugh. \"That is one of the  tricks of The Painted Beauty. If we leave it alone for a few seconds we  shall find that it will come to life again.\"    He took the creature from her and laid it gently on the grass. They  waited, watching it curiously. All at once the apparently lifeless  butterfly began a slight vibration of its wings. Suddenly it rose and  was gone; as strong and free as ever.    Adele clapped her hands in delight, and Bee smiled. She was acquainted  with the butterfly, and had seen the trick before.    \"I never saw anything so cunning in all my life,\" cried Adele. \"Are all  butterflies as cute, Uncle William?\"    \"Not all; but the most of them have marvelous life histories. Come,  girls! we must not loiter. We have two calls to make, you know.\"          Chapter XVII    The Two Calls                                  \"A thousand flowers,      By the road-side and the borders of the brook,      Nod gayly to each other; glossy leaves      Are twinkling in the sun, as if the dew      Were on them yet, and silver waters break      Into small waves and sparkle as he comes.\"        --_Summer Wind.
