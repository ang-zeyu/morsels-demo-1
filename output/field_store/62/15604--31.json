He gesticulated, and said  something in his native language.    \"He hasn't got next,\" reported Master Maloney. \"He can't git on to  me curves. Dese wop kids is all boneheads. Say, kid, look-a here.\"  He walked out of the room and closed the door; then, rapping on it  smartly from the outside, re-entered and, assuming a look of  extreme ferocity, stretched out his hand and thundered: \"Unbelt-a!  Slip-a me da stuff!\"    The wop kid's puzzlement became pathetic.    \"This,\" said Psmith, deeply interested, \"is getting about as tense  as anything I ever struck. Don't give in, Comrade Maloney. Who  knows but that you may yet win through? I fancy the trouble is that  your too perfect Italian accent is making the youth home-sick. Once  more to the breach, Comrade Maloney.\"    Master Maloney made a gesture of disgust. \"I'm t'roo. Dese Dagoes  makes me tired. Dey don't know enough to go upstairs to take de  Elevated. Beat it, you mutt,\" he observed with moody displeasure  to the wop kid, accompanying the words with a gesture which  conveyed its own meaning. The wop kid, plainly glad to get away,  slipped out of the door like a shadow.    Pugsy shrugged his shoulders.    \"Gents,\" he said resignedly, \"it's up to youse.\"    \"I fancy,\" said Psmith, \"that this is one of those moments when it  is necessary for me to unlimber my Sherlock Holmes system. As thus.  If the rent collector _had_ been here, it is certain, I think, that  Comrade Spaghetti, or whatever you said his name was, wouldn't have  been. That is to say, if the rent collector had called and found no  money waiting for him, surely Comrade Spaghetti would have been out  in the cold night instead of under his own roof-tree. Do you follow  me, Comrade Maloney?\"    \"That's right,\" said Billy Windsor. \"Of course.\"    \"Elementary, my dear Watson, elementary,\" murmured Psmith.    \"So all we have to do is to sit here and wait.\"    \"All?\" said Psmith sadly. \"Surely it is enough. For of all the  scaly localities I have struck this seems to me the scaliest. The  architect of this Stately Home of America seems to have had a  positive hatred for windows. His idea of ventilation was to leave  a hole in the wall about the size of a lima bean and let the thing  go at that. If our friend does not arrive shortly, I shall pull  down the roof. Why, gadzooks! Not to mention stap my vitals! Isn't  that a trap-door up there? Make a long-arm, Comrade Windsor.\"    Billy got on a chair and pulled the bolt. The trap-door opened  downwards. It fell, disclosing a square of deep blue sky.    \"Gum!\" he said. \"Fancy living in this atmosphere when you don't  have to. Fancy these fellows keeping that shut all the time.\"    \"I expect it is an acquired taste,\" said Psmith, \"like Limburger  cheese. They don't begin to appreciate air till it is thick enough  to scoop chunks out of with a spoon. Then they get up on their hind  legs and inflate their chests and say, 'This is fine! This beats  ozone hollow!' Leave it open, Comrade Windsor. And now, as to the  problem of dispensing with Comrade Maloney's services?\"    \"Sure,\" said Billy. \"Beat it, Pugsy, my lad.\"    Pugsy looked up, indignant.    \"Beat it?\" he queried.    \"While your shoe leather's good,\" said Billy. \"This is no place  for a minister's son. There may be a rough house in here any  minute, and you would be in the way.\"    \"I want to stop and pipe de fun,\" objected Master Maloney.    \"Never mind. Cut off. We'll tell you all about it to-morrow.\"    Master Maloney prepared reluctantly to depart. As he did so there  was a sound of a well-shod foot on the stairs, and a man in a  snuff-coloured suit, wearing a brown Homburg hat and carrying a  small notebook in one hand, walked briskly into the room. It was  not necessary for Psmith to get his Sherlock Holmes system to work.  His whole appearance proclaimed the new-comer to be the  long-expected collector of rents.        CHAPTER XX    CORNERED    He stood in the doorway looking with some surprise at the group  inside. He was a smallish, pale-faced man with protruding eyes and  teeth which gave him a certain resemblance to a rabbit.    \"Hello,\" he said.    \"Welcome to New York,\" said Psmith.    Master Maloney, who had taken advantage of the interruption to edge  farther into the room, now appeared to consider the question of his  departure permanently shelved. He sidled to a corner and sat down  on an empty soap-box with the air of a dramatic critic at the  opening night of a new play. The scene looked good to him. It  promised interesting developments. Master Maloney was an earnest  student of the drama, as exhibited in the theatres of the East  Side, and few had ever applauded the hero of \"Escaped from  Sing-Sing,\" or hissed the villain of \"Nellie, the Beautiful  Cloak-Model\" with more fervour than he. He liked his drama to have  plenty of action, and to his practised eye this one promised well.  Psmith he looked upon as a quite amiable lunatic, from whom little  was to be expected; but there was a set expression on Billy  Windsor's face which suggested great things.    His pleasure was abruptly quenched. Billy Windsor, placing a firm  hand on his collar, led him to the door and pushed him out, closing  the door behind him.    The rent collector watched these things with a puzzled eye. He now  turned to Psmith.    \"Say, seen anything of the wops that live here?\" he inquired.    \"I am addressing--?\" said Psmith courteously.    \"My name's Gooch.\"    Psmith bowed.    \"Touching these wops, Comrade Gooch,\" he said, \"I fear there is  little chance of your seeing them to-night, unless you wait some  considerable time. With one of them--the son and heir of the  family, I should say--we have just been having a highly interesting  and informative chat. Comrade Maloney, who has just left us, acted  as interpreter. The father, I am told, is in the dungeon below the  castle moat for a brief spell for punching his foreman in the  eye. The result? The rent is not forthcoming.\"    \"Then it's outside for theirs,\" said Mr. Gooch definitely.    \"It's a big shame,\" broke in Billy, \"turning the kid out. Where's  he to go?\"    \"That's up to him. Nothing to do with me. I'm only acting under  orders from up top.\"    \"Whose orders, Comrade Gooch?\" inquired Psmith.    \"The gent who owns this joint.\"    \"Who is he?\" said Billy.    Suspicion crept into the protruding eyes of the rent collector. He  waxed wroth. \"Say!\" he demanded. \"Who are you two guys, anyway, and  what do you think you're doing here? That's what I'd like to know.  What do you want with the name of the owner of this place? What  business is it of yours?\"    \"The fact is, Comrade Gooch, we are newspaper men.\"    \"I guessed you were,\" said Mr. Gooch with triumph. \"You can't bluff  me. Well, it's no good, boys. I've nothing for you. You'd better  chase off and try something else.\"    He became more friendly.    \"Say, though,\" he said, \"I just guessed you were from some  paper. I wish I could give you a story, but I can't. I guess  it's this _Cosy Moments_ business that's been and put your editor  on to this joint, ain't it? Say, though, that's a queer thing,  that paper. Why, only a few weeks ago it used to be a sort of  take-home-and-read-to-the-kids affair. A friend of mine used  to buy it regular. And then suddenly it comes out with a  regular whoop, and started knocking these tenements and  boosting Kid Brady, and all that. I can't understand it. All I  know is that it's begun to get this place talked about. Why,  you see for yourselves how it is. Here is your editor sending  you down to get a story about it. But, say, those _Cosy Moments_  guys are taking big risks. I tell you straight they are, and  that goes. I happen to know a thing or two about what's going  on on the other side, and I tell you there's going to be  something doing if they don't cut it out quick. Mr.--\" he  stopped and chuckled, \"Mr. Jones isn't the man to sit still and  smile. He's going to get busy. Say, what paper do you boys come  from?\"    \"_Cosy Moments_, Comrade Gooch,\" Psmith replied. \"Immediately behind  you, between you and the door, is Comrade Windsor, our editor. I am  Psmith. I sub-edit.\"    For a moment the inwardness of the information did not seem to come  home to Mr. Gooch. Then it hit him. He spun round. Billy Windsor  was standing with his back against the door and a more than nasty  look on his face.    \"What's all this?\" demanded Mr. Gooch.    \"I will explain all,\" said Psmith soothingly. \"In the first place,  however, this matter of Comrade Spaghetti's rent. Sooner than see  that friend of my boyhood slung out to do the  wandering-child-in-the-snow act, I will brass up for him.\"    \"Confound his rent. Let me out.\"    \"Business before pleasure. How much is it? Twelve dollars? For the  privilege of suffocating in this compact little Black Hole? By my  halidom, Comrade Gooch, that gentleman whose name you are so  shortly to tell us has a very fair idea of how to charge! But who  am I that I should criticise? Here are the simoleons, as our young  friend, Comrade Maloney, would call them. Push me over a receipt.\"    \"Let me out.\"    \"Anon, gossip, anon.--Shakespeare. First, the receipt.\"    Mr. Gooch scribbled a few words in his notebook and tore out the  page. Psmith thanked him.    \"I will see that it reaches Comrade Spaghetti,\" he said. \"And now  to a more important matter. Don't put away that notebook. Turn to  a clean page, moisten your pencil, and write as follows. Are you  ready? By the way, what is your Christian name? . . . Gooch, Gooch,  this is no way to speak! Well, if you are sensitive on the point,  we will waive the Christian name. It is my duty to tell you,  however, that I suspect it to be Percy. Let us push on.

Oberholser  (1919b:416) listed _Hedymeles melanocephalus papago_ (=_P. m.  melanocephalus_) from Sierra Guadalupe on April 27. Dickerman saw  Black-headed Grosbeaks in the Sierra del Pino on May 12, 1954, and 16  mi. E and 18 mi. N Ocampo on May 7, 1954. The size of No. 31664  represents the characters of _P. m. melanocephalus_ as presented by  Oberholser (1919b:413). No specimen of _P. m. melanocephalus_ from  Coahuila, to my knowledge, approaches _P. m. maculatus_. The size of  the testes (7x5 mm.) of No. 31664 suggests breeding by this subspecies  in the Sierra Guadalupe.    *_Guiraca caerulea interfusa_ Dwight and Griscom.--_Specimens  examined:_ total 2: [Male] 32138 from 12 mi. N, 12 mi. W Jimenez, 850  ft., June 18, 1952; and [Female] 32139 from 2 mi. W Jimenez, 850 ft.,  June 21, 1952.    Burleigh and Lowery (1942:206) recorded this Blue Grosbeak from \"about  twenty miles west of Saltillo\" on April 22. Miller (1955a:174) stated  that Marsh obtained a male _G. c. interfusa_ at Vivoras Spring on  August 3. Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:334) remarked  that the Blue Grosbeak breeds in the northern and eastern sections and  reported _G. c. interfusa_ from Hipolito on July 2. Amadon and Phillips  (1947:580) reported examining material from Sabinas referable to _G. c.  interfusa_. Dickerman saw Blue Grosbeaks 4 mi. N San Isidro on May 10,  1954. Findley saw Blue Grosbeaks 4 mi. W Jimenez on June 19, 1952, and  2 mi. S and 3 mi. E San Juan de Sabinas on June 22, 1952. Nos.  32138-32139 are typical representatives of _G. c. interfusa_. The size  of the testes (12 mm.) of No. 32138, the size of the largest ovum (2  mm.) of No. 32139, and the dates (June 18, 21) on which they were  collected are evidence of breeding by this subspecies.    **_Guiraca caerulea eurhyncha_ Coues.--Amadon and Phillips (1947:580)  obtained an adult male of this Blue Grosbeak from Las Delicias on  August 12. This subspecies, according to Miller, Friedmann, Griscom,  and Moore (1957:334), is resident at middle and lower elevations  through most of central and southern Mexico. Except for the occurrence  of intergrades of _G. c. interfusa_, _caerulea_, and _eurhyncha_ in  southern Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas (Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and  Moore, 1957:335), the record from Las Delicias represents the northern  limit of the range of the subspecies _eurhyncha_.    *_Passerina cyanea_ (Linnaeus).--_Specimen examined:_ one, [Male]  31544, from San Marcos, May 5, 1954.    The Indigo Bunting is rare in Coahuila. Van Hoose (1955:303) reported  that No. 31544 seems to provide the first record of the species in the  State. The Indigo Bunting is a summer resident in southwestern Oklahoma  and southeastern Texas (Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore,  1957:336). No. 31544 seemingly represents a large extension in the  summer range of the Indigo Bunting. Van Hoose (_loc. cit._) stated that  No. 31544 was observed chasing another male, and the pursuer in turn  was followed by a female; he thought that the territorial behavior of  this bird suggested breeding.    *_Passerina versicolor versicolor_ (Bonaparte).--_Specimens examined:_  total 2: [Male] 35414 from 6 mi. N, 2 mi. W Castillon, 3750 ft., June  30, 1953, weight, 8 gms.; and [Male] 35415 from 5 mi. S Castillon, 4150  ft., June 28, 1953.    Although the Varied Bunting has been recorded only from northwestern  Coahuila, I suspect that this bird is locally common throughout most of  the State. Miller (1955a:174) stated that the habitat of this species  consisted of catclaw-covered bottom lands at the base of the Sierra del  Carmen at 4700 feet. Miller's records indicate incipient breeding by  _P. v. versicolor_ in the Sierra del Carmen on April 26. The size of  the testes (11 mm.) of No. 35415 and the dates (June 28, 30) on which  Nos. 35414-35415 were collected are strong evidence of breeding by the  Varied Bunting 6 mi. N and 2 mi. W Castillon and 5 mi. S Castillon.    *_Passerina ciris pallidior_ Mearns.--_Specimens examined:_ total 6:  [Male] 32141 and [Female] 32142 from 2 mi. S, 11 mi. E Nava, 810 ft.,  June 15 and 16, 1952; [Male] 35416 from 6 mi. N, 2 mi. W Castillon,  3750 ft., June 29, 1953, weight, 15 gms.; [Male] 32140 from 2 mi. S, 3  mi. E San Juan de Sabinas, June 22, 1952; [Male] 31547 from 16 mi. N,  14 mi. E Ocampo, May 10, 1954, weight, 16 gms.; and [Male] 31546 from  San Marcos, May 5, 1954.    The Painted Bunting is a common summer resident in Coahuila. Marsh and  Stevenson (1938:287) wrote that Painted Buntings were common in summer  in the foothills of the Sierra del Carmen, and they took a male at  Piedra Blanca on July 25 and a female at Jardin del Sur on September 1.  Amadon and Phillips (1947:580) remarked that two immature Painted  Buntings, \"apparently migrants, were taken at Las Delicias on August 10  and 11.\" Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:339) recorded  breeding by _P. c. pallidior_ at Hipolito, 4200 feet, on July 1.  Findley saw Painted Buntings 2 mi. S and 11 mi. E Nava on June 15,  1952. Dickerman saw Painted Buntings 4 mi. N San Isidro on May 10,  1954. Hardy saw Painted Buntings at Parras on July 4, 1955.    All the University of Kansas specimens are typical of the larger  subspecies _pallidior_. The dates (May 5, 10; June 15, 16, 22, 29) on  which these specimens were collected, the sizes of the testes (9x6 mm.;  6x5 mm.; 7x3 mm.) of Nos. 32140, 31547, and 31546, respectively, and  the size of the largest ovum (2.5 mm.) of No. 32142 indicate breeding  by _P. c. pallidior_ in Coahuila.    _Carpodacus cassinii_ Baird.--Cassin's Finch is an uncommon winter  migrant in Coahuila. Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:314)  listed _C. cassinii_ from Sierra Guadalupe.    *_Carpodacus mexicanus potosinus_ Griscom.--_Specimens examined:_ total  8: [Male] 35417 from 13 mi. S, 5 mi. W Castillon, 4000 ft., June 28,  1953, testes, 6 mm., weight, 19 gms.; [Female] 35411 (skeleton only)  from Sierra del Pino (=5 mi. W, 3 mi. S Acebuches), 6200 ft., May 14,  1954; [Male] 32145 from 5 mi. N, 19 mi. W Cuatro Cienegas, 3250 ft.,  July 5, 1952; [Male] 32144 and [Female] 32147 from 3 mi. S, 3 mi. E  Bella Union, 6750 ft., June 27, 1952, [Male] gonads, 7 mm.; [Male]  32143 and [Female] 32146 from 7 mi. S, 4 mi. E Bella Union, 7200 ft.,  June 24, 1952; and [Male] 31675 from the west foot of Pico de Jimulco,  5000 ft., April 4, 1953, weight, 20 gms.    The House Finch is common in Coahuila. Miller (1955a:174) reported a  sparse population of this species in the foothills adjoining Boquillas  Canyon at 4800 feet of the Sierra del Carmen and observed young just  out of the nest on April 25. He remarked also that specimens of the  House Finch from the Sierra del Carmen seem to show no intergradation  toward _frontalis_. Burleigh and Lowery (1942:206) noted _C. m.  potosinus_ at \"Saltillo, in the desert country west of there, at the  Chorro del Agua, and in the open valley south of Diamante Pass.\"  Miller, Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:316) listed breeding by _C.  m. potosinus_ at El Diamante on July 6. Dickerman also saw the House  Finch at San Marcos on May 4, 1954, and Hardy saw it at Parras on July  4, 1955. No. 32147 had a distinct brood patch; the largest ovum of No.  32146 was 7 mm. in diameter. No. 32145 was a juvenile male.    The University of Kansas specimens agree well with descriptions of _C.  m. potosinus_ as given by Moore (1939:195). No approach toward _C. m.  frontalis_, _centralis_, or _nigrescens_ is exhibited by any of these  specimens. No. 31675, from Pico de Jimulco in southwestern Coahuila, is  paler above and below than any other specimens of _C. m. potosinus_.  Also the crown of No. 31675 is suffused with more red than in typical  representatives of _C. m. potosinus_.    **_Spinus pinus pinus_ (Wilson).--_Specimen examined:_ one, sex ? 33219  (skeleton only) from 13 mi. E San Antonio de las Alazanas, 9950 ft.,  July 6, 1955.    On April 5, 7, and 21, Miller (1955a:175) recorded winter visitant or  vagrant flocks of Pine Siskins in the Sierra del Carmen. Miller,  Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore (1957:318) listed _S. p. pinus_ south to  Sierra Guadalupe. Dickerman saw Pine Siskins 13 mi. E San Antonio de  las Alazanas on April 10, 1954.    _Spinus pinus macropterus_ (Bonaparte).--Miller, Friedmann, Griscom,  and Moore (1957:319) recorded a vagrant _S. p. macropterus_ from 50 mi.  S Monclova, 2850 feet, on November 9.    _Spinus tristis pallidus_ Mearns.--_Specimen examined:_ one, [Female]  31101, from Fortin (=33 mi. N, 8 mi. W San Geronimo), 3300 ft., March  28, 1952, weight, 11.5 gms.    The American Goldfinch is an uncommon migrant or winter visitant in  Coahuila. Hellmayr (1938:296) recorded _S. t. pallidus_ from Sabinas.  Fortin and Sabinas are the only places in Coahuila where _S. t.  pallidus_ has been collected. No. 31101 is a typical representative of  _S. t. pallidus_.    **_Spinus psaltria psaltria_ (Say).--_Specimens examined:_ total 7:  [Male] [Male] 32148-32149 and [Female] 32151 from 12 mi. N, 12 mi. W  Jimenez, 850 ft., June 19, 1952; [Male] 32150 from 2 mi. W Jimenez,  June 20, 1952; [Male] 33220 (skeleton only) from Parras, July 4, 1955;  and [Male] 32939 and [Female] 32940 from Mesa de las Tablas, July 7,  1955, weights, 9.5, 11 gms.    In Coahuila, the Lesser Goldfinch seems to be common. Although Miller  (1955a:175) did not find it in the Sierra del Carmen, he reported that  Marsh took a specimen on August 22 in Chuperosa Canyon that was  \"presumed to\" be _S. p. psaltria_. Burleigh and Lowery (1942:206)  observed the Lesser Goldfinch \"on the outskirts of Saltillo in an  orchard on April 20.\"    Nos. 32148-32151 and 32940 were typical for the subspecies _psaltria_.
