X.    \"At the Great Midland,\" replied the other, \"at least my bags have gone  on there.\"    \"I'll come along and see you to-morrow morning. It's curious this should  have happened the night you returned,\" he said, gripping the other's  shoulder affectionately.    John Lexman did not speak for the moment.    \"If anything happened to Kara,\" he said slowly, \"if the worst that was  possible happened to him, believe me I should not weep.\"    T. X. looked down into the other's eyes sympathetically.    \"I think he has hurt you pretty badly, old man,\" he said gently.    John Lexman nodded.    \"He has, damn him,\" he said between his teeth.    The Chief Commissioner's motor car was waiting outside and in this T.  X., Mansus, and a detective-sergeant were whirled off to Cadogan Square.  Fisher was in the hall when they rung the bell and opened the door  instantly.    He was frankly surprised to see his visitors. Mr. Kara was in his room  he explained resentfully, as though T. X. should have been aware of the  fact without being told. He had heard no bell ringing and indeed had not  been summoned to the room.    \"I have to see him at eleven o'clock,\" he said, \"and I have had standing  instructions not to go to him unless I am sent for.\"    T. X. led the way upstairs, and went straight to Kara's room. He  knocked, but there was no reply. He knocked again and on this failing to  evoke any response kicked heavily at the door.    \"Have you a telephone downstairs!\" he asked.    \"Yes, sir,\" replied Fisher.    T. X. turned to the detective-sergeant.    \"'Phone to the Yard,\" he said, \"and get a man up with a bag of tools. We  shall have to pick this lock and I haven't got my case with me.\"    \"Picking the lock would be no good, sir,\" said Fisher, an interested  spectator, \"Mr. Kara's got the latch down.\"    \"I forgot that,\" said T. X. \"Tell him to bring his saw, we'll have to  cut through the panel here.\"    While they were waiting for the arrival of the police officer T. X.  strove to attract the attention of the inmates of the room, but without  success.    \"Does he take opium or anything!\" asked Mansus.    Fisher shook his head.    \"I've never known him to take any of that kind of stuff,\" he said.    T. X. made a rapid survey of the other rooms on that floor. The room  next to Kara's was the library, beyond that was a dressing room which,  according to Fisher, Miss Holland had used, and at the farthermost end  of the corridor was the dining room.    Facing the dining room was a small service lift and by its side a  storeroom in which were a number of trunks, including a very large one  smothered in injunctions in three different languages to \"handle with  care.\" There was nothing else of interest on this floor and the upper  and lower floors could wait. In a quarter of an hour the carpenter had  arrived from Scotland Yard, and had bored a hole in the rosewood panel  of Kara's room and was busily applying his slender saw.    Through the hole he cut T. X. could see no more than that the room was  in darkness save for the glow of a blazing fire. He inserted his hand,  groped for the knob of the steel latch, which he had remarked on his  previous visit to the room, lifted it and the door swung open.    \"Keep outside, everybody,\" he ordered.    He felt for the switch of the electric, found it and instantly the room  was flooded with light. The bed was hidden by the open door. T. X. took  one stride into the room and saw enough. Kara was lying half on and half  off the bed. He was quite dead and the blood-stained patch above his  heart told its own story.    T. X. stood looking down at him, saw the frozen horror on the dead man's  face, then drew his eyes away and slowly surveyed the room. There in the  middle of the carpet he found his clue, a bent and twisted little candle  such as you find on children's Christmas trees.            CHAPTER XIV      It was Mansus who found the second candle, a stouter affair. It lay  underneath the bed. The telephone, which stood on a fairly large-sized  table by the side of the bed, was overturned and the receiver was on the  floor. By its side were two books, one being the \"Balkan Question,\"  by Villari, and the other \"Travels and Politics in the Near East,\" by  Miller. With them was a long, ivory paper-knife.    There was nothing else on the bedside-table save a silver cigarette  box. T. X. drew on a pair of gloves and examined the bright surface for  finger-prints, but a superficial view revealed no such clue.    \"Open the window,\" said T. X., \"the heat here is intolerable. Be very  careful, Mansus. By the way, is the window fastened?\"    \"Very well fastened,\" said the superintendent after a careful scrutiny.    He pushed back the fastenings, lifted the window and as he did, a harsh  bell rang in the basement.    \"That is the burglar alarm, I suppose,\" said T. X.; \"go down and stop  that bell.\"    He addressed Fisher, who stood with a troubled face at the door. When  he had disappeared T. X. gave a significant glance to one of the waiting  officers and the man sauntered after the valet.    Fisher stopped the bell and came back to the hall and stood before the  hall fire, a very troubled man. Near the fire was a big, oaken writing  table and on this there lay a small envelope which he did not remember  having seen before, though it might have been there for some time, for  he had spent a greater portion of the evening in the kitchen with the  cook.    He picked up the envelope, and, with a start, recognised that it was  addressed to himself. He opened it and took out a card. There were only  a few words written upon it, but they were sufficient to banish all the  colour from his face and set his hands shaking. He took the envelope and  card and flung them into the fire.    It so happened that, at that moment, Mansus had called from upstairs,  and the officer, who had been told off to keep the valet under  observation, ran up in answer to the summons. For a moment Fisher  hesitated, then hatless and coatless as he was, he crept to the door,  opened it, leaving it ajar behind him and darting down the steps, ran  like a hare from the house.    The doctor, who came a little later, was cautious as to the hour of  death.    \"If you got your telephone message at 10.25, as you say, that was  probably the hour he was killed,\" he said. \"I could not tell within half  an hour. Obviously the man who killed him gripped his throat with his  left hand--there are the bruises on his neck--and stabbed him with the  right.\"    It was at this time that the disappearance of Fisher was noticed, but  the cross-examination of the terrified Mrs. Beale removed any doubt that  T. X. had as to the man's guilt.    \"You had better send out an 'All Stations' message and pull him in,\"  said T. X. \"He was with the cook from the moment the visitor left until  a few minutes before we rang. Besides which it is obviously impossible  for anybody to have got into this room or out again. Have you searched  the dead man?\"    Mansus produced a tray on which Kara's belongings had been disposed.  The ordinary keys Mrs. Beale was able to identify. There were one or two  which were beyond her. T. X. recognised one of these as the key of the  safe, but two smaller keys baffled him not a little, and Mrs. Beale was  at first unable to assist him.    \"The only thing I can think of, sir,\" she said, \"is the wine cellar.\"    \"The wine cellar?\" said T. X. slowly. \"That must be--\" he stopped.    The greater tragedy of the evening, with all its mystifying aspects had  not banished from his mind the thought of the girl--that Belinda Mary,  who had called upon him in her hour of danger as he divined. Perhaps--he  descended into the kitchen and was brought face to face with the  unpainted door.    \"It looks more like a prison than a wine cellar,\" he said.    \"That's what I've always thought, sir,\" said Mrs. Beale, \"and sometimes  I've had a horrible feeling of fear.\"    He cut short her loquacity by inserting one of the keys in the lock--it  did not turn, but he had more success with the second. The lock snapped  back easily and he pulled the door back. He found the inner door bolted  top and bottom. The bolts slipped back in their well-oiled sockets  without any effort. Evidently Kara used this place pretty frequently,  thought T. X.    He pushed the door open and stopped with an exclamation of surprise. The  cellar apartment was brilliantly lit--but it was unoccupied.    \"This beats the band,\" said T. X.    He saw something on the table and lifted it up. It was a pair of  long-bladed scissors and about the handle was wound a handkerchief. It  was not this fact which startled him, but that the scissors' blades were  dappled with blood and blood, too, was on the handkerchief. He unwound  the flimsy piece of cambric and stared at the monogram \"B. M. B.\"    He looked around. Nobody had seen the weapon and he dropped it in his  overcoat pocket, and walked from the cellar to the kitchen where Mrs.  Beale and Mansus awaited him.    \"There is a lower cellar, is there not!\" he asked in a strained voice.    \"That was bricked up when Mr. Kara took the house,\" explained the woman.    \"There is nothing more to look for here,\" he said.    He walked slowly up the stairs to the library, his mind in a whirl. That  he, an accredited officer of police, sworn to the business of criminal  detection, should attempt to screen one who was conceivably a criminal  was inexplicable. But if the girl had committed this crime, how had she  reached Kara's room and why had she returned to the locked cellar!    He sent for Mrs. Beale to interrogate her. She had heard nothing and  she had been in the kitchen all the evening.

We can now, I think, account for the ether boiling, and the water  freezing in vacuo, at the same temperature.**        [Footnote **: See page 102.]    MRS. B.    Let me hear how you explain it.    EMILY.    The latent heat, which the water gave out in freezing, was immediately  absorbed by the ether, during its conversion into vapour; and therefore,  from a latent state in one liquid, it passed into a latent state in the  other.    MRS. B.    But this only partly accounts for the result of the experiment; it  remains to be explained why the temperature of the ether, while in a  state of ebullition, is brought down to the freezing temperature of the  water. --It is because the ether, during its evaporation, reduces its  own temperature, in the same proportion as that of the water, by  converting its free caloric into latent heat: so that, though one liquid  boils, and the other freezes, their temperatures remain in a state of  equilibrium.    EMILY.    But why does not water, as well as ether, reduce its own temperature by  evaporating?    MRS. B.    The fact is that it does, though much less rapidly than ether. Thus, for  instance, you may often have observed, in the heat of summer, how much  any particular spot may be cooled by watering, though the water used for  that purpose be as warm as the air itself. Indeed so much cold may be  produced by the mere evaporation of water, that the inhabitants of  India, by availing themselves of the most favourable circumstances for  this process which their warm climate can afford, namely, the cool of  the night, and situations most exposed to the night breeze, succeed in  causing water to freeze, though the temperature of the air be as high as  60 degrees. The water is put into shallow earthen trays, so as to expose  an extensive surface to the process of evaporation, and in the morning,  the water is found covered with a thin cake of ice, which is collected  in sufficient quantity to be used for purposes of luxury.    CAROLINE.    How delicious it must be to drink liquids so cold in those tropical  climates! But, Mrs. B., could we not try that experiment?    MRS. B.    If we were in the country, I have no doubt but that we should be able to  freeze water, by the same means, and under similar circumstances. But we  can do it immediately, upon a small scale, in this very room, in which  the thermometer stands at 70 degrees. For this purpose we need only  place some water in a little cup under the receiver of the air-pump  (PLATE V. fig. 1.), and exhaust the air from it. What will be the  consequence, Caroline?      [Illustration: Plate V. Vol. I. page 138.      Fig. 1.    The air-pump & receiver for Mr. Leslie's experiment.    C a saucer with sulphuric Acid.    B a glass or earthen cup containing Water.    D a stand for the cup with its legs made of Glass.    A a Thermometer.      Fig. 2. Dr. Wollaston's Cryophorus.      Fig. 5. Dr. Marcet's mode of using the Cryophorus.      Fig. 3. & 4. the different parts of Fig. 5. seen separate.]    CAROLINE.    Of course the water will evaporate more quickly, since there will no  longer be any atmospheric pressure on its surface: but will this be  sufficient to make the water freeze?    MRS. B.    Probably not, because the vapour will not be carried off fast enough;  but this will be accomplished without difficulty if we introduce into  the receiver (fig. 1.), in a saucer, or other large shallow vessel, some  strong sulphuric acid, a substance which has a great attraction for  water, whether in the form of vapour, or in the liquid state. This  attraction is such that the acid will instantly absorb the moisture as  it rises from the water, so as to make room for the formation of fresh  vapour; this will of course hasten the process, and the cold produced  from the rapid evaporation of the water, will, in a few minutes, be  sufficient to freeze its surface.* We shall now exhaust the air from the  receiver.        [Footnote *: This experiment was first devised by Mr. Leslie, and      has since been modified in a variety of forms.]    EMILY.    Thousands of small bubbles already rise through the water from the  internal surface of the cup; what is the reason of this?    MRS. B.    These are bubbles of air which were partly attached to the vessel, and  partly diffused in the water itself; and they expand and rise in  consequence of the atmospheric pressure being removed.    CAROLINE.    See, Mrs. B.; the thermometer in the cup is sinking fast; it has already  descended to 40 degrees!    EMILY.    The water seems now and then violently agitated on the surface, as if it  was boiling; and yet the thermometer is descending fast!    MRS. B.    You may call it _boiling_, if you please, for this appearance is, as  well as boiling, owing to the rapid formation of vapour; but here, as  you have just observed, it takes place from the surface, for it is only  when heat is applied to the bottom of the vessel that the vapour is  formed there. --Now crystals of ice are actually shooting all over the  surface of the water.    CAROLINE.    How beautiful it is! The surface is now entirely frozen--but the  thermometer remains at 32 degrees.    MRS. B.    And so it will, conformably with our doctrine of latent heat, until the  whole of the water is frozen; but it will then again begin to descend  lower and lower, in consequence of the evaporation which goes on from  the surface of the ice.    EMILY.    This is a most interesting experiment; but it would be still more  striking if no sulphuric acid were required.    MRS. B.    I will show you a freezing instrument, contrived by Dr. Wollaston, upon  the same principle as Mr. Leslie's experiment, by which water may be  frozen by its own evaporation alone, without the assistance of sulphuric  acid.    This tube, which, as you see (PLATE V. fig. 2.), is terminated at each  extremity by a bulb, one of which is half full of water, is internally  perfectly exhausted of air; the consequence of this is, that the water  in the bulb is always much disposed to evaporate. This evaporation,  however, does not proceed sufficiently fast to freeze the water; but if  the empty ball be cooled by some artificial means, so as to condense  quickly the vapour which rises from the water, the process may be thus  so much promoted as to cause the water to freeze in the other ball. Dr.  Wollaston has called this instrument _Cryophorus_.    CAROLINE.    So that cold seems to perform here the same part which the sulphuric  acid acted in Mr. Leslie's experiment?    MRS. B.    Exactly so; but let us try the experiment.    EMILY.    How will you cool the instrument? You have neither ice nor snow.    MRS. B.    True: but we have other means of effecting this.* You recollect what an  intense cold can be produced by the evaporation of ether in an exhausted  receiver. We shall inclose the bulb in this little bag of fine flannel  (fig. 3.), then soke it in ether, and introduce it into the receiver of  the air-pump. (Fig. 5.) For this purpose we shall find it more  convenient to use a cryophorus of this shape (fig. 4.), as its elongated  bulb passes easily through a brass plate which closes the top of the  receiver. If we now exhaust the receiver quickly, you will see, in less  than a minute, the water freeze in the other bulb, out of the receiver.        [Footnote *: This mode of making the experiment was proposed, and      the particulars detailed, by Dr. Marcet, in the 34th vol. of      Nicholson's Journal, page 119.]    EMILY.    The bulb already looks quite dim, and small drops of water are  condensing on its surface.    CAROLINE.    And now crystals of ice shoot all over the water. This is, indeed,  a very curious experiment!    MRS. B.    You will see, some other day, that, by a similar method, even  quicksilver may be frozen. --But we cannot at present indulge in any  further digression.    Having advanced so far on the subject of heat, I may now give you an  account of the calorimeter, an instrument invented by Lavoisier, upon  the principles just explained, for the purpose of estimating the  specific heat of bodies. It consists of a vessel, the inner surface of  which is lined with ice, so as to form a sort of hollow globe of ice, in  the midst of which the body, whose specific heat is to be ascertained,  is placed. The ice absorbs caloric from this body, till it has brought  it down to the freezing point; this caloric converts into water a  certain portion of the ice which runs out through an aperture at the  bottom of the machine; and the quantity of ice changed to water is a  test of the quantity of caloric which the body has given out in  descending from a certain temperature to the freezing point.    CAROLINE.    In this apparatus, I suppose, the milk, chalk, and lead, would melt  different quantities of ice, in proportion to their different capacities  for caloric?    MRS. B.    Certainly: and thence we are able to ascertain, with precision, their  respective capacities for heat. But the calorimeter affords us no more  idea of the absolute quantity of heat contained in a body, than the  thermometer; for though by means of it we extricate both the free and  combined caloric, yet we extricate them only to a certain degree, which  is the freezing point; and we know not how much they contain of either  below that point.    EMILY.    According to the theory of latent heat, it appears to me that the  weather should be warm when it freezes, and cold in a thaw: for latent  heat is liberated from every substance that it freezes, and such a large  supply of heat must warm the atmosphere; whilst, during a thaw, that  very quantity of free heat must be taken from the atmosphere, and return  to a latent state in the bodies which it thaws.    MRS. B.    Your observation is very natural; but consider that in a frost the  atmosphere is so much colder than"]]]
