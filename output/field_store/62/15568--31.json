While preaching on Sabbath evening, heavenly light broke in       on my soul, and all was peace.         I am now among the dear objects of my care. My heart leaped for joy       as I came in sight of the village, and received such a hearty       welcome. Much refreshed with meeting them in Class, and       particularly in private conversation with Peter Jones, about the       dispensations of God towards us in the increase of our graces and       gifts. We had about thirty boys out at work this evening clearing       land. They are very apt in learning to work.         _April 18th._--I was impressed to-day with the fact that the       untutored Indian can display all the noble feelings of gratitude,       love, and benevolence. An Indian, who has lately come to this place       and embraced the Christian religion, has ever since shown great       attachment to me. He has, without my knowledge, watered, fed, and       taken care of my horse, saying he lived closer to the stable than I       did. Yesterday I got out of hay, and could not get any till this       afternoon. When I came to the stable I found grass in the manger;       the Indian was there, and had just fed him. I said I was very glad,       for he must be very hungry, but the Indian replied, \"No, he not       very hungry. I took him down where grass grow, and let him eat       plenty.\" Oh, God, thought I, do such principles dwell in the people       whom the white man despises? Is not this as noble and pure as it is       simple? Though the circumstance is small in itself, it involves a       moral principle to which many mighty men are strangers. He gave the       widow's mite. Enfeebled by sickness, he exposed himself; touched by       compassion, he relieved the sufferer. A few weeks ago, a heathen       from the forest, he now performs an act that might make many       Christians blush. How many professing Christians consider it a       condescension to attend upon the servant of Christ and his beast,       but this wild man of the woods esteems it a privilege to wash His       disciple's feet. \"Many that are first shall be last, and the last       shall be first.\"         _April 25th._--Last Sunday, four Indians came from Lake Simcoe,       over fifty miles, to hear the words of eternal life, while many       professors will scarcely go a mile. Does not this fulfil prophecy,       \"Many shall come from the east, and the west, and sit down in the       kingdom of God, while the children of the kingdom are thrust out?\"       Last summer they heard Peter Jones, at Lake Simcoe, tell the story       of the Saviour's love. They then determined to renounce ardent       spirits, and pray to the Great Spirit. With this little       preparation, they had been enabled to totter along in the path of       morality from that time till now. The old man (Wm. Snake) seems       under deep convictions, weeps much, and expresses much sorrow for       his former bad doings. They have gone back, determined to get as       many of their tribe as possible to return by the first of June.       Surely this is \"hungering and thirsting after righteousness.\"         _April 29th--Sabbath._--In our Class-meetings, one of the Indian       Leaders expressed himself thus:--\"I am happy to-day. It is not with       my life alone I love Jesus, but I love Him right here (pressing his       hand upon his heart.) If I did not serve Him, what would I tell Him       when He came? Would I tell Him a lie? No, my brothers, I will tell       Him no story. I will serve Him with my whole heart. When I hear any       of my brothers or my sisters praying in the daytime alone,[13] it       makes my heart feel so glad. The tears run out of my two eyes, I       feel so happy. I love Jesus more and more. Pray for me, that I may       hold on to the end; and when Jesus comes, I may go with Him and all       of you up to heaven.\" Another one said, \"Three of us have been two       or three days in the bush, but we prayed, three poor souls of us,       three times a day, and Jesus did make our souls so happy.\"         _April 30th._--According to announcement, we assembled in the       Chapel to examine into the cases of several who had acted       disorderly. We were compelled to expel two from the Society. Many       were deeply affected, and groans, and sighs might be heard in the       different parts of the house. After a long and wise address from       the old Chief, Joseph Sawyer, I said, \"We must turn them out of the       Society. What do you think about sending them away from the       village? Tell us.\" Several spoke, and it was at last decided, by       holding up the right hand, that they must go. I then said, \"I am       sorry to hear one or two have been drinking.\" I asked one if this       was true. He confessed that he drank some beer, being coaxed by a       white man. He felt very sorry, as he wished to be a good Christian.       I then reproved with considerable severity, and showed him it was       as bad to get drunk on cider or beer as whiskey. The devil often       cheats us in this way, but we are exhorted not to \"touch, taste, or       handle\" the accursed thing. This talk was explained to them in       Indian by Peter Jones, and their opinions requested. Several spoke,       but Brother William Herkimer, with a pathos that affected us all,       said, \"Brothers, the white man can't pour it down your throat, if       you will not drink. When white man ask me to drink, I tell him, 'I       am a Christian, I love Jesus,' and they go right away and look       ashamed.\" He then concluded with a most pathetic prayer: \"Oh,       Jesus, let us poor, weak creatures be faithful, and serve Thee as       long as we live.\" Having adjusted these matters, I next observed,       \"Our God has given us another commandment which was, 'To keep holy       the Sabbath day.' Now, brothers, if a man gave you six dollars, and       kept only one for himself, would you not think it very bad to rob       him of that one? Oh, yes, you will say. Well the Lord has done more       for us. He has given us our lives, our clothes, our health, nay,       everything we have, and six days too, to do all our work in; but He       has kept out one day for Himself. Let us not rob God of this day,       but let us keep it holy. I am sorry to hear that one of you went to       York on Sunday.\" I turned to the guilty Indian, and told him I       wanted him to tell us why he had done so. He stated he had got out       of provisions, and he was afraid the wind would rise on Monday, and       unthinkingly he started on Sunday afternoon. He promised to do so       no more. I then spoke a few words from Gal. vi. 1, and Peter Jones       closed with an affecting exhortation and prayer.         _May 2nd._--Yesterday I was almost in despair, and I was really       devising means to relinquish my present work; when in the height of       agitation I took down a package of tracts, and providentially       (surely not by chance) cast my eyes upon one entitled,       \"Disobedience Punished, Repented of, and Pardoned.\" This was no       other than the history of Jonah; and was made the means of reviving       my expiring faith, and showing me how God alone could give me       victory over myself. I cried to Him like Jonah, and He delivered me       out of my distress.         [Illustration: School and Council House. Church. Peter Jones'       Study.         OLD CREDIT MISSION. (_From a sketch by Mrs. E. Carey._)]         _May 3rd._--To-day I have felt peace with God and good will towards       men. Several Indian women have arrived from Scugog Lake. They       report that the Indians there have all stood firm, daily meeting       for prayer to the Great Spirit, and that there has only been one       case of intoxication since Peter Jones was there last autumn. This       unhappy circumstance was caused by one (Carr) an old Methodist       back-slider (a fit emissary of the devil), who took his barrel of       whiskey, in order to trade with the Indians. He tried in vain to       persuade them to taste, till at length he made some of the whiskey       into bitters, which he called medicine, and prevailed on one unwary       man to take for his health. This he repeated several times, till at       length the poor fellow got to relish it, and becoming overpowered       he fell into the water! The Indians immediately assembled for       prayer, and through the mercy of God, he is now restored to his       former steadfastness. They then ordered Carr to take his whiskey       away, or they would destroy it. He took it on the ice, on the lake,       no doubt hoping that it would tempt some of them to drink. But in       this the devil was disappointed, the ice thawed, and the barrel       floated on the water. What an instance of human depravity, does       this man's conduct exhibit, and what a picture of the power of       Divine grace is seen in the inflexible firmness of the Indians!       May we not sing in the language of Paradise Regained--                           \"The tempter foiled         In all his wiles, defeated, and repuls'd,         And Eden raised in the waste wilderness.\"         The Indian woman who related the above, gave another proof of the       amiable and benevolent character of her race, especially when       sanctified by grace. In token of their esteem for Peter Jones, who       had been the means of opening their eyes to immortality and eternal       life, they brought him several pounds of maple sugar, which one of       them presented in a wooden bowl. No doubt this sugar, which they       had carried sixty miles, was nearly their all. Is not this a       feeling of gratitude and love to the disciple for the master's       sake? Oh! that I may learn lessons of simplicity and contentment       from these children of the forest, for they"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24593"],[0,"The Oriental Story Book: A Collection of Tales (#20)"],[1,"of the bystanders  at this turn of the affair; the old man, in particular, seemed to be  much amazed, as he looked inquiringly on one and another. Thereupon  Labakan spoke, with a composure gained only by the most powerful  effort.    \"Most gracious lord and father, be not led astray by this man. He is,  as far as I know, a mad journeyman tailor of Alexandria, by name  Labakan, who deserves rather our pity than our anger.\"    These words excited the prince almost to phrensy. Foaming with  passion, he would have sprung upon Labakan, but the bystanders,  throwing themselves between, secured him, while the old man said:  \"Truly, my beloved son, the poor man is crazed. Let them bind him and  place him on one of our dromedaries; perhaps we may be of some  assistance to the unfortunate.\"    The anger of the prince had abated; in tears, he cried out to the old  man, \"My heart tells me that you are my father; by the memory of my  mother, I conjure you--hear me!\"    \"Alas! God guard us!\" answered he: \"already he again begins to talk  wildly. How can the man come by such crazy thoughts?\" Thereupon,  seizing Labakan's arm, he made him accompany him down the hill. They  both mounted fine and richly-caparisoned coursers, and rode at the  head of the procession, across the plain. They tied the hands of the  unfortunate prince, however, and bound him securely upon a dromedary.  Two horsemen rode constantly by his side, who kept a watchful eye upon  his every movement.    The old prince was Saoud, sultan of the Wechabites. For some time had  he lived without children; at last a prince, for whom he had so  ardently longed, was born to him. But the astrologer, whom he  consulted respecting the destiny of his son, told him that, until his  twenty-second year, he would be in danger of being supplanted by an  enemy. On that account, in order that he might be perfectly safe, had  the sultan given him, to be brought up, to his old and tried friend,  Elfi Bey; and twenty-two sad years had lived without looking upon him.    This did the sultan impart to his supposed son, and seemed delighted  beyond measure with his figure and dignified demeanor.    When they reached the sultan's dominions, they were everywhere  received by the inhabitants with shouts of joy; for the rumor of the  prince's arrival had spread like wildfire through the cities and  towns. In the streets through which they proceeded, arches of flowers  and branches were erected; bright carpets of all colors adorned the  houses; and the people loudly praised God and his prophet, who had  discovered to them so noble a prince. All this filled the proud heart  of the tailor with delight: so much the more unhappy did it make the  real Omar, who, still bound, followed the procession in silent  despair. In this universal jubilee, though it was all in his honor, no  one paid him any attention. A thousand, and again a thousand, voices  shouted the name of Omar; but of him who really bore this name, of him  none took notice: at most, only one or two inquired whom they were  carrying with them, so tightly bound, and frightfully in the ears of  the prince sounded the answer of his guards, \"It is a mad tailor.\"    The procession at last reached the capital of the sultan, where all  was prepared for their reception with still more brilliancy than in  the other cities. The sultana, an elderly woman of majestic  appearance, awaited them, with her whole court, in the most splendid  saloon of the castle. The floor of this room was covered with a large  carpet; the walls were adorned with bright blue tapestry, which was  suspended from massive silver hooks, by cords and tassels of gold.    [Illustration]    It was dark by the time the procession came up, and accordingly many  globular colored lamps were lighted in the saloon, which made night  brilliant as day; but with the clearest brilliancy and most varied  colors, shone those in the farthest part of the saloon, where the  sultana was seated upon a throne. The throne stood upon four steps,  and was of pure gold, inlaid with amethysts. The four most illustrious  emirs held a canopy of crimson silk over the head of their mistress;  and the sheik of Medina cooled her with a fan of peacock feathers.  Thus awaited the sultana her husband and son; the latter she had never  looked on since his birth, but significant dreams had so plainly shown  her the object of her longings, that she would know him out of  thousands.    Now they heard the noise of the approaching troop; trumpets and drums  mingled with the huzzas of the populace; the hoofs of the horses  sounded on the court of the palace; steps came nearer and nearer; the  doors of the room flew open, and, through rows of prostrate  attendants, hastened the sultan, holding his son by the hand, towards  the mother's throne.    \"Here,\" said he, \"do I bring to thee, him for whom thou hast so often  longed.\"    The sultana, however, interrupted him, crying: \"This is not my son!  These are not the features which the Prophet has shown me in my  dreams!\"    Just as the sultan was about to rebuke her superstition, the door of  the saloon sprang open, and Prince Omar rushed in, followed by his  guards, whom an exertion of his whole strength had enabled him to  escape. Breathless, he threw himself before the throne, exclaiming:--    \"Here will I die! Kill me, cruel father, for this disgrace I can  endure no longer!\"    All were confounded at these words; they pressed around the  unfortunate one, and already were the guards, who had hurried up, on  the point of seizing him and replacing his fetters, when the sultana,  who had thus far looked on in mute astonishment, sprang from the  throne.    \"Hold!\" she cried; \"this, and no other, is my son! This is he, who,  though my eyes have never seen him, is well known to my heart!\" The  guards had involuntarily fallen back from Omar, but the sultan,  foaming with rage, commanded them to bind the madman.    \"It is mine to decide,\" he cried with commanding tone; \"and here we  will judge, not by a woman's dreams, but by sure and infallible  signs. This,\" pointing to Labakan, \"is my son, for he has brought me  the dagger, the real token of my friend Elfi.\"    \"He stole it,\" cried Omar; \"my unsuspicious confidence has he  treacherously abused!\" But the sultan hearkened not to the voice of  his son, for he was wont in all things obstinately to follow his own  judgment. He bade them forcibly drag the unfortunate Omar from the  saloon, and himself retired with Labakan to his chamber, filled with  anger at his wife, with whom, nevertheless, he had lived in happiness  for five-and-twenty years. The sultana was full of grief at this  affair; she was perfectly convinced that an impostor had taken  possession of the sultan's heart, so numerous and distinct had been  the dreams which pointed out the unhappy Omar as her son. When her  sorrow had a little abated, she reflected on the means of convincing  her husband of his mistake. This was indeed difficult, for he who had  passed himself off as her son, had presented the dagger, the token of  recognition, and had, moreover, as she learned, become acquainted with  so much of Omar's early life from the lips of the prince himself, as  to be able to play his part without betraying himself.    She called to her the men who had attended the sultan to the pillar  El-Serujah, in order to have the whole matter exactly laid before her,  and then took counsel with her most trusty female slaves. She chose,  and in a moment rejected, this means and that; at length, Melechsalah,  an old and cunning Circassian, spoke.    \"If I have heard rightly, honored mistress, the one who bore this  dagger called him whom thou holdest to be thy son, a crazy tailor,  Labakan?\"    \"Yes, it is so,\" answered the sultana; \"but what wilt thou make of  that?\"    \"What think you,\" proceeded the slave, \"of this impostor's having  stitched his own name upon your son? If this be so, we have an  excellent way of catching the deceiver, which I will impart to you in  private.\"    The sultana gave ear to her slave, and the latter whispered to her a  plan which seemed to please her, for she immediately got ready to go  to the sultan. The sultana was a sensible woman, and knew not only  the weak side of her husband, but also the way to take advantage of  it. She seemed therefore to give up, and to be willing to acknowledge  her son, only offering one condition: the sultan, whom the outbreak  between himself and his wife had grieved, agreed thereto, and she  said:--    \"I would fain have from each a proof of his skill; another, perhaps,  would have them contend in riding, in single conflict, or in hurling  spears: but these are things which every one can do; I will give them  something which will require both knowledge and dexterity. It shall be  this; each shall make a caftan, and a pair of pantaloons, and then  will we see at once who can make the finest ones.\"    The sultan laughingly answered, \"Ah! thou hast hit on a fine  expedient! Shall my son contend with a mad tailor, to see who can make  the best caftan? No! that cannot be.\" The sultana, however, cried out,  that he had already agreed to the condition, and her husband, who was  a man of his word, at length yielded, though he swore, should the mad  tailor make his caftan ever so beautiful, he would never acknowledge  him as his son.    The sultan thereupon went to his son, and entreated him to submit to  the caprices of his mother, who now positively wished to see a caftan  from his hands. The heart of the good Labakan laughed with delight; if  that be all that is wanting, thought he to himself, then shall the  lady sultana soon behold me with joy. Two rooms had been fitted up,  one for the prince, the other for the tailor; there were they to try  their skill, and each was furnished with shears, needles, thread, and  a sufficient quantity of silk.    The sultan was very eager to see what sort of a caftan "]]]
