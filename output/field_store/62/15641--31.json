The stocks stand by the churchyard gates, side by  side with a curious little shrubbery. Shrubberies are rare ornaments of  a village, but this sets a pretty foreground to the low line of whitened  cottages behind it.    [Illustration: _Shalford._]    Shalford Common is wide and breezy; geese cackle over its grass, and you  may see more than one cricket match being played on holiday afternoons.  Once, in 1877, eleven Mitchells played eleven Heaths on the common; the  Heaths were all of the same family, but the Mitchells, though related,  were not. But the greatest tradition of Shalford Common is its  connection with a Bedfordshire man, John Bunyan. Bunyan is said to have  lived in two houses in Surrey, a cottage on Quarry Hill in Guildford,  and at Horn Hatch, now pulled down, on Shalford Common. Probably the  tradition would not have grown up without good ground; there is one  possible reason, at all events, for connecting Bunyan with this part of  Surrey. The idea of _Pilgrim's Progress_ is said to have been suggested  to him by the very Pilgrims' Way, and Vanity Fair to be the fair held on  the meadow between Shalford and Guildford below St. Catherine's Chapel.  The Rector of Shalford had the privilege of holding a fair from the days  of King John, and undoubtedly Shalford Fair was one of the largest held  on the Way; indeed, it was so popular that the Guildford clergy disputed  the Rector's right to exact fees from the Winchester merchants attending  it. They wanted the money in Guildford. But the Chief Justice of the  King's Bench gave his judgment in the Shalford Rector's favour, and at  the height of the fair's prosperity it actually covered a hundred and  forty acres of ground. If tradition is right, then, it was in the fields  by Shalford Church that Bunyan pictured Christian and Faithful seized  and brought before the Court of the fair, and poor Faithful sentenced by  Lord Hategood \"to be led from the place where he was to the place from  whence he came, and there to be put to the most cruel death that could  be invented.\" No doubt Bunyan's description of the trial of the two  pilgrims at the fair is an exact picture of the methods of the Court of  Pie-powder, or _Pied-puldreaux_, the tribunal which could be summoned at  a moment's notice among the merchants of the fair. The Court of  Dusty-Feet certainly worked with alarming despatch.    If Bunyan really drew his _Pilgrim's Progress_ from his memories of the  pilgrims and their fairs on the Way, he may have had other scenes in his  mind which suggested other names. The Delectable Mountains may have been  the blue line of the Sussex Downs, or the hills by Black Down and  Hindhead. The Slough of Despond may have been the marshy pools of  Shalford Common, or the ponds under the hill by Chilworth; and Doubting  Castle, spelt Dowding Castle, is actually a name to be found on the  Surrey map, south of Epsom Downs on Banstead Heath. But whether Bunyan  ever saw it there is another matter.    From Shalford Common the road runs almost straight to Bramley. But it is  worth while to leave the main road as it crosses the single railway line  from Shalford to Bramley and Cranleigh, and to turn to the right down  the little road that leads to Unstead Farm, a delightful brick and  timber building, with exceptionally graceful chimney-stacks and latticed  casements, behind which, in summer, there should surely be the largest  bowls of roses. I saw the old house last in a frosty December sunset,  surrounded by floodwater, with farm horses splashing up the road, and  plovers crying round the edges of the stream. It looked desolate enough;  but three hundred years ago it was a fine house, at one time the  property of the Austens of Shalford, and later passing into the hands of  the trustees of Henry Smith, the \"Dog Smith\" who gave so much to Surrey  charities, and about whom Aubrey heard a quaint legend. \"He had the  nickname of Dog-Smyth, because he kept no house, but dined at friends'  houses, and then desired a bit for his dog, which was to refect  himself.\" Was he merely a crochety old gentleman who always went about  with his dog, or did he keep the dog's dinner for himself? Another story  about him was that once, when he was a poor boy, he was whipped through  one of the Surrey parishes--accounts differ as to whether it was  Chilworth, Tatsfield, or Wanborough--and that he struck that particular  parish out of his will, but left large sums to all the others. He  certainly left a large fortune to Surrey parishes, and no bequests have  found their way to Chilworth, Tatsfield, or Wanborough, but that is the  only foundation for the old story.    A mile south-west of Unstead Farm lies Bramley, which has grown up round  the station of the single railway line running to Guildford. The  restored church holds some good glass, but the prettiest thing in  Bramley is an old mill which, with its medlar tree overhanging the  water, its ducks and pigeons, its octagonal brick dovecot and lichened  roofs, and its sweet-water grape vine clambering on the old walls, has  a rich grace of colour and age setting it, in modern Bramley, a thing  apart.    Bramley is almost joined by Wonersh to the east: Wonersh with its quaint  other names, Wogheners, which was perhaps the original form, Wonish,  Ignorsh, and Ognersh. Wonersh was once a very important village. It was  one of the centres of the wool trade in the county, and of Wonersh, as  of Guildford, Aubrey has the same sad story to tell of cheating  clothiers. But, as we have seen, the real cause of the decay of the  Surrey wool industry was something quite different. Perhaps one of  Wonersh's rival clothiers started the story of the stretched cloth;  perhaps it was never a libel.    One of the features of the village is an enormous wall, built by one of  the Lords Grantley who had Wonersh Park, and put up the wall,  apparently, to prevent neighbours and passers-by from gazing with too  great enthusiasm at his lordship's grass and trees. It was a brother of  the third Lord Grantley, George Norton, Recorder of Guildford, who  married the famous Mrs. Norton, one of the three beautiful  granddaughters of Richard Brinsley Sheridan.    Besides Lord Grantley's wall, the village holds some charming old  cottages, several of them carefully restored, and two or three  square-set, solid eighteenth-century houses. There is also a slender  brick chimney of elaborate design of which Wonersh residents are justly  proud. The village, indeed, conveys the impression of being  affectionately cared for, which is not always the case with villages  which belong so much to builders long dead; but nothing, perhaps, is a  better example of the care with which the past is preserved than the  church, which is a perfect piece of restoration and scholarly rebuilding  combined. It is the work of a Surrey architect, Sir Charles Nicholson, a  neighbour at Chilworth, who carried out his difficult task in 1901, and  has since written an interesting little pamphlet on the church's  history. Two or three peculiarities distinguish the interior. One is a  crypt, paved with fourteenth-century encaustic tiles, which Aubrey  describes as \"a vault strongly barricaded with iron.\" Another is a  magnificent Flemish chandelier, not a common adornment of a chancel. A  third is a high tomb of Sussex marble, which bears no inscription. But  the person buried in it must have been of considerable distinction, for  the cassia in which the remains Were embalmed still sweats from the  marble in wet weather--a grisly barometer. Possibly within may rest the  remains of one of the Westons or Carylls, both of which were great  families of the neighbourhood. It was John Caryll, buried in this  church, on whom was written an epitaph quoted by Aubrey, but not now to  be found. The eight lines of rhyme ended with what was perhaps thought  appropriately cheerful resignation:--        \"And now, which long before he did desire,      Caryll sings Carrolls in the Heavenly Choire.\"    North of Wonersh rises Chinthurst Hill, a knoll conspicuous for miles  round, especially in winter, when the bleached grass of its wind-swept,  pine-crowned cap gleams strangely white in the sun. North of Chinthurst  Hill, again, on the far side of the open stretch of Shalford Common,  stands one of the most perfect timbered houses--perhaps it is the most  perfect--in the county. This is the famous Tangley Manor, which  according to the legend was one of King John's hunting boxes, and is now  as delightfully picturesque a country house as is to be seen in the  south of England. Like other old mansions in the county, Crowhurst  Place, for instance, the building of it belongs to two periods. It is a  house, or rather a hall, within a house. The hall is the older part. It  was a feature of English country life previous to the sixteenth century  that the labourers and dependants of the great country estates ate, and  in the earliest days even slept, in the hall of the mansion. When that  system of common hall life ended, it nearly always happened that the  great hall was cut in two, by a floor and bedrooms built in the upper  part. This is what has happened at Tangley and at Crowhurst Place, and  in each case the remains of the hall can be traced in the superb oak  tie-beams which cross the bedrooms from side to side of the house. The  hall is cased by a more modern building, a rich timber framework with  the date 1582 carved sprawling on the wood. The garden has every charm  that can belong to lichened brick walls, loop-holed and many-gated, and  through the garden round the house runs a moat, in which trout swim, or  once swam.

What do you want to be married for, you  silly fellow? If I was a fine, young, strapping chap like you, I should  be ashamed of being milksop enough to pin myself to a woman's  apron-strings! Why, she'll be an old woman before you're a middle-aged  man! And a pretty figure you'll cut then, with a draggle-tailed wife and  a crowd of squalling children crying after you wherever you go!\"    Oh, he knew how to banter the common people, Alderman Cute!    \"There! Go along with you,\" said the Alderman, \"and repent. Don't make  such a fool of yourself as to get married on New Year's Day. You'll  think very differently of it, long before next New Year's Day: a trim  young fellow like you, with all the girls looking after you. There! Go  along with you!\"    They went along. Not arm in arm, or hand in hand, or interchanging  bright glances; but she in tears; he gloomy and down-looking. Were these  the hearts that had so lately made old Toby's leap up from its  faintness? No, no. The Alderman (a blessing on his head!) had Put _them_  Down.    \"As you happen to be here,\" said the Alderman to Toby, \"you shall carry  a letter for me. Can you be quick? You're an old man.\"    Toby, who had been looking after Meg, quite stupidly, made shift to  murmur out that he was very quick, and very strong.    \"How old are you?\" inquired the Alderman.    \"I am over sixty, sir,\" said Toby.    \"Oh! This man's a great deal past the average age, you know,\" cried Mr.  Filer, breaking in as if his patience would bear some trying, but this  was really carrying matters a little too far.    \"I feel I'm intruding, sir,\" said Toby. \"I--I misdoubted it this  morning. Oh dear me!\"    The Alderman cut him short by giving him the letter from his pocket.  Toby would have got a shilling too; but Mr. Filer clearly showing that  in that case he would rob a certain given number of persons of  ninepence-half-penny a-piece, he only got sixpence; and thought himself  very well off to get that.    Then the Alderman gave an arm to each of his friends, and walked off in  high feather; but, he immediately came hurrying back alone, as if he had  forgotten something.    \"Porter!\" said the Alderman.    \"Sir!\" said Toby.    \"Take care of that daughter of yours. She's much too handsome.\"    \"Even her good looks are stolen from somebody or other I suppose,\"  thought Toby, looking at the sixpence in his hand, and thinking of the  tripe. \"She's been and robbed five hundred ladies of a bloom a-piece, I  shouldn't wonder. It's very dreadful!\"    \"She's much too handsome, my man,\" repeated the Alderman. \"The chances  are, that she'll come to no good, I clearly see. Observe what I say.  Take care of her!\" With which, he hurried off again.    \"Wrong every way. Wrong every way!\" said Trotty clasping his hands.  \"Born bad. No business here!\"    The Chimes came clashing in upon him as he said the last words. Full,  loud, and sounding--but with no encouragement. No, not a drop.    \"The tune's changed,\" cried the old man, as he listened. \"There's not a  word of all that fancy in it. Why should there be? I have no business  with the New Year nor with the old one neither. Let me die!\"    Still the Bells, pealing forth their changes, made the very air spin.  Put 'em down. Put 'em down! Good old Times, Good old Times! Facts and  Figures, Facts and Figures! Put 'em down, Put 'em down! If they said  anything they said this, until the brain of Toby reeled.    He pressed his bewildered head between his hands as if to keep it from  splitting asunder. A well-timed action, as it happened; for finding the  letter in one of them, and being by that means reminded of his charge,  he fell, mechanically, into his usual trot, and trotted off.      SECOND QUARTER.    The letter Toby had received from Alderman Cute, was addressed to a  great man in the great district of the town. The greatest district of  the town. It must have been the greatest district of the town, because  it was commonly called \"the world\" by its inhabitants.    The Year was Old, that day. The patient Year had lived through the  reproaches and misuses of its slanderers, and faithfully performed its  work. Spring, summer, autumn, winter. It had labored through the  destined round, and now laid down its weary head to die.    Trotty had no portion, to his thinking, in the New Year or the Old.    \"Put 'em down. Put 'em down! Facts and Figures, Facts and Figures! Good  old Times, Good old Times! Put 'em down, Put 'em down!\"--his trot went  to that measure, and would fit itself to nothing else.    But, even that one, melancholy as it was, brought him, in due time, to  the end of his journey. To the mansion of Sir Joseph Bowley, Member of  Parliament.    The door was opened by a Porter. Such a Porter! Not of Toby's order.  Quite another thing. His place was the ticket, though; not Toby's.    This Porter underwent some hard panting before he could speak; having  breathed himself by coming incautiously out of his chair, without first  taking time to think about it and compose his mind. When he had found  his voice--which it took him some time to do, for it was a long way off  and hidden under a load of meat--he said in a fat whisper:    \"Who's it from?\"    Toby told him.    \"You're to take it in yourself,\" said the Porter, pointing to a room at  the end of a long passage, opening from the hall. \"Everything goes  straight in, on this day of the year. You're not a bit too soon; for the  carriage is at the door now, and they have only come to town for a  couple of hours, a'purpose.\"    Toby wiped his feet (which were quite dry already) with great care, and  took the way pointed out to him, observing as he went that it was an  awfully grand house, but hushed and covered up, as if the family were in  the country. Knocking at the room door, he was told to enter from  within; and doing so found himself in a spacious library, where, at a  table strewn with files and papers, were a stately lady in a bonnet, and  a not very stately gentleman in black, who wrote from her dictation;  while another, and an older, and a much statelier gentleman, whose hat  and cane were on the table, walked up and down, with one hand in his  breast, and looked complacently from time to time at his own picture--a  full length; a very full length--hanging over the fire-place.    \"What is this?\" said the last-named gentleman. \"Mr. Fish, will you have  the goodness to attend?\"    Mr. Fish begged pardon, and taking the letter from Toby, handed it, with  great respect.    \"From Alderman Cute, Sir Joseph.\"    \"Is this all? Have you nothing else, Porter?\" inquired Sir Joseph.    Toby replied in the negative.    \"You have no bill or demand upon me--my name is Bowley, Sir Joseph  Bowley--of any kind from anybody, have you?\" said Sir Joseph. \"If you  have, present it. There is a cheque-book by the side of Mr. Fish. I  allow nothing to be carried into the New Year. Every description of  account is settled in this house at the close of the old one. So that if  death was to--to--\"    \"To cut,\" suggested Mr. Fish.    \"To sever, sir,\" returned Sir Joseph, with great asperity, \"the cord of  existence--my affairs would be found, I hope, in a state of  preparation.\"    \"My dear Sir Joseph!\" said the lady, who was greatly younger than the  gentleman. \"How shocking!\"    \"My Lady Bowley,\" returned Sir Joseph, floundering now and then, as in  the great depth of his observations, \"at this season of the year we  should think of--of--ourselves. We should look into our--our accounts.  We should feel that every return of so eventful a period in human  transactions involves matter of deep moment between a man and his--and  his banker.\"    Sir Joseph delivered these words as if he felt the full morality of what  he was saying, and desired that even Trotty should have an opportunity  of being improved by such discourse. Possibly he had this end before him  in still forbearing to break the seal of the letter, and in telling  Trotty to wait where he was a minute.    \"I _am_ the Poor Man's Friend,\" observed Sir Joseph, glancing at the  poor man present. \"As such I may be taunted. As such I have been  taunted. But I ask no other title.\"    \"Bless him for a noble gentleman!\" thought Trotty.    \"I don't agree with Cute here, for instance,\" said Sir Joseph, holding  out the letter. \"I don't agree with the Filer party. I don't agree with  any party. My friend, the Poor Man, has no business with any thing of  that sort, and nothing of that sort has any business with him. My  friend, the Poor Man, in my district, is my business. No man or body of  men has any right to interfere between my friend and me. That is the  ground I take. I assume a--a paternal character toward my friend. I say,  'My good fellow, I will treat you paternally.'\"    With that great sentiment, he opened the Alderman's letter, and read it.    \"Very polite and attentive, I am sure!\" exclaimed Sir Joseph. \"My lady,  the Alderman is so obliging as to remind me that he has had 'the  distinguished honor'--he is very good--of meeting me at the house of our  mutual friend Deedles, the banker, and he does me the favor to inquire  whether it will be agreeable to me to have Will Fern put down. He came  up to London, it seems, to look for employment (trying to better  himself--that's his story), and being found at night asleep in a shed,  was taken into custody, and carried next morning before the Alderman.  The Alderman observes (very properly) that he is determined to put this  sort of thing down, and that if it will be agreeable to me to have Will  Fern put down, he will be happy to begin with him.\"    \"Let him be made an example of, by all means,\" returned the lady. \"Last  winter, when I introduced pinking and eyelet-holing among the men"]]]
