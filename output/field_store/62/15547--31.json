I have referred to the disposition on the part of the white people in  the town of Tuskegee and vicinity to help the school. From the first, I  resolved to make the school a real part of the community in which it was  located. I was determined that no one should have the feeling that it  was a foreign institution, dropped down in the midst of the people, for  which they had no responsibility and in which they had no interest.  I noticed that the very fact that they had been asking to contribute  toward the purchase of the land made them begin to feel as if it was  going to be their school, to a large degree. I noted that just in  proportion as we made the white people feel that the institution was  a part of the life of the community, and that, while we wanted to make  friends in Boston, for example, we also wanted to make white friends in  Tuskegee, and that we wanted to make the school of real service to all  the people, their attitude toward the school became favourable.    Perhaps I might add right here, what I hope to demonstrate later, that,  so far as I know, the Tuskegee school at the present time has no warmer  and more enthusiastic friends anywhere than it has among the white  citizens of Tuskegee and throughout the state of Alabama and the entire  South. From the first, I have advised our people in the South to  make friends in every straightforward, manly way with their next-door  neighbour, whether he be a black man or a white man. I have also advised  them, where no principle is at stake, to consult the interests of their  local communities, and to advise with their friends in regard to their  voting.    For several months the work of securing the money with which to pay for  the farm went on without ceasing. At the end of three months enough was  secured to repay the loan of two hundred and fifty dollars to General  Marshall, and within two months more we had secured the entire five  hundred dollars and had received a deed of the one hundred acres of  land. This gave us a great deal of satisfaction. It was not only a  source of satisfaction to secure a permanent location for the school,  but it was equally satisfactory to know that the greater part of the  money with which it was paid for had been gotten from the white and  coloured people in the town of Tuskegee. The most of this money was  obtained by holding festivals and concerts, and from small individual  donations.    Our next effort was in the direction of increasing the cultivation of  the land, so as to secure some return from it, and at the same time give  the students training in agriculture. All the industries at Tuskegee  have been started in natural and logical order, growing out of the needs  of a community settlement. We began with farming, because we wanted  something to eat.    Many of the students, also, were able to remain in school but a few  weeks at a time, because they had so little money with which to pay  their board. Thus another object which made it desirable to get an  industrial system started was in order to make it available as a means  of helping the students to earn money enough so that they might be able  to remain in school during the nine months' session of the school year.    The first animal that the school came into possession of was an old  blind horse given us by one of the white citizens of Tuskegee. Perhaps  I may add here that at the present time the school owns over two hundred  horses, colts, mules, cows, calves, and oxen, and about seven hundred  hogs and pigs, as well as a large number of sheep and goats.    The school was constantly growing in numbers, so much so that, after we  had got the farm paid for, the cultivation of the land begun, and the  old cabins which we had found on the place somewhat repaired, we turned  our attention toward providing a large, substantial building. After  having given a good deal of thought to the subject, we finally had the  plans drawn for a building that was estimated to cost about six thousand  dollars. This seemed to us a tremendous sum, but we knew that the school  must go backward or forward, and that our work would mean little unless  we could get hold of the students in their home life.    One incident which occurred about this time gave me a great deal of  satisfaction as well as surprise. When it became known in the town that  we were discussing the plans for a new, large building, a Southern white  man who was operating a sawmill not far from Tuskegee came to me and  said that he would gladly put all the lumber necessary to erect the  building on the grounds, with no other guarantee for payment than my  word that it would be paid for when we secured some money. I told the  man frankly that at the time we did not have in our hands one dollar of  the money needed. Notwithstanding this, he insisted on being allowed to  put the lumber on the grounds. After we had secured some portion of the  money we permitted him to do this.    Miss Davidson again began the work of securing in various ways small  contributions for the new building from the white and coloured people  in and near Tuskegee. I think I never saw a community of people so happy  over anything as were the coloured people over the prospect of this new  building. One day, when we were holding a meeting to secure funds for  its erection, an old, ante-bellum coloured man came a distance of twelve  miles and brought in his ox-cart a large hog. When the meeting was in  progress, he rose in the midst of the company and said that he had no  money which he could give, but he had raised two fine hogs, and that  he had brought one of them as a contribution toward the expenses of the  building. He closed his announcement by saying: \"Any nigger that's got  any love for his race, or any respect for himself, will bring a hog  to the next meeting.\" Quite a number of men in the community also  volunteered to give several days' work, each, toward the erection of the  building.    After we had secured all the help that we could in Tuskegee, Miss  Davidson decided to go North for the purpose of securing additional  funds. For weeks she visited individuals and spoke in churches and  before Sunday schools and other organizations. She found this work quite  trying, and often embarrassing. The school was not known, but she was  not long in winning her way into the confidence of the best people in  the North.    The first gift from any Northern person was received from a New York  lady whom Miss Davidson met on the boat that was bringing her North.  They fell into a conversation, and the Northern lady became so much  interested in the effort being made at Tuskegee that before they parted  Miss Davidson was handed a check for fifty dollars. For some time before  our marriage, and also after it, Miss Davidson kept up the work of  securing money in the North and in the South by interesting people by  personal visits and through correspondence. At the same time she kept in  close touch with the work at Tuskegee, as lady principal and classroom  teacher. In addition to this, she worked among the older people in and  near Tuskegee, and taught a Sunday school class in the town. She was  never very strong, but never seemed happy unless she was giving all  of her strength to the cause which she loved. Often, at night, after  spending the day in going from door to door trying to interest persons  in the work at Tuskegee, she would be so exhausted that she could not  undress herself. A lady upon whom she called, in Boston, afterward told  me that at one time when Miss Davidson called her to see and send up her  card the lady was detained a little before she could see Miss Davidson,  and when she entered the parlour she found Miss Davidson so exhausted  that she had fallen asleep.    While putting up our first building, which was named Porter Hall, after  Mr. A.H. Porter, of Brooklyn, N.Y., who gave a generous sum toward  its erection, the need for money became acute. I had given one of our  creditors a promise that upon a certain day he should be paid four  hundred dollars. On the morning of that day we did not have a dollar.  The mail arrived at the school at ten o'clock, and in this mail there  was a check sent by Miss Davidson for exactly four hundred dollars.  I could relate many instances of almost the same character. This four  hundred dollars was given by two ladies in Boston. Two years later, when  the work at Tuskegee had grown considerably, and when we were in the  midst of a season when we were so much in need of money that the future  looked doubtful and gloomy, the same two Boston ladies sent us  six thousand dollars. Words cannot describe our surprise, or the  encouragement that the gift brought to us. Perhaps I might add here that  for fourteen years these same friends have sent us six thousand dollars  a year.    As soon as the plans were drawn for the new building, the students began  digging out the earth where the foundations were to be laid, working  after the regular classes were over. They had not fully outgrown the  idea that it was hardly the proper thing for them to use their hands,  since they had come there, as one of them expressed it, \"to be educated,  and not to work.\" Gradually, though, I noted with satisfaction that a  sentiment in favour of work was gaining ground. After a few weeks of  hard work the foundations were ready, and a day was appointed for the  laying of the corner-stone.    When it is considered that the laying of this corner-stone took place in  the heart of the South, in the \"Black Belt,\" in the centre of that  part of our country that was most devoted to slavery; that at that time  slavery had been abolished only about sixteen years; that only sixteen  years before no Negro could be taught from books without the teacher  receiving the condemnation of the law or of public sentiment--when all"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23800"],[0,"Contemporary American Composers (#20)"],[1," Bonny Curl\"  catches the Scotch-ton faithfully.    Chadwick usually succeeds, however, in catching foreign flavors. His  \"Song from the Persian\" is one of his best works, and possibly the  very best is his \"Sorais' Song,\" to Rider Haggard's splendid words.  It has an epic power and a wild despair. Up to the flippancy of its  last measures, it is quite inspired, and one of the strongest of  American songs. The \"Danza\" is captivating and full of novelty. \"Green  Grows the Willow\" is a burden of charming pathos and quaintness,  though principally a study in theme-management. \"Allah,\" however, is  rather Ethiopian than Mahommedan. His \"Bedouin Love Song\" has little  Oriental color, but is full of rush and fire, with a superb ending. It  is the best of the countless settings of this song. I wish I could say  the same of his \"Thou Art so Like a Flower,\" but he has missed the  intense repression of Heine.    [Music: _To Mrs. G.H. Stoddard._    TWO FOLK SONGS.    I    G.W.

Schmidt.]    The \"Serenade\" displays an interesting rhythm; \"The Miller's Daughter\"  is tender, and \"A Warning\" is delightfully witty. One regrets,  however, that its best points were previously used in Schumann's  perfect folk-song, \"Wenn ich frueh in den Garten geh'.\" Chadwick has  two folk-songs of his own, however, which are superb. \"He Loves Me\" is  a tender, cradle-song-like bit of delicious color. The \"Lullaby\" is a  genuinely interesting study in this overworked form. \"The Lily\" has  the passionate lyricism of Chaminade, and \"Sweet Wind that Blows\" is a  fine frenzy. The \"Nocturne\" is dainty and has its one good climax.  \"Before the Dawn\" has some of Chadwick's best work; it is especially  marked by a daring harmonic--you might say--_impasto_.    His principal works, besides those mentioned, may be catalogued (I am  unable to do more than catalogue most of them, having seen only one of  them, \"The Lily Nymph,\" performed, and having read the score of only  the \"Melpomene\" overture): Concert overtures, \"Rip Van Winkle\"  (written in Leipzig, 1879, and played there the same year), \"Thalia\"  (1883), \"Melpomene\" (1887), \"The Miller's Daughter\" (1887), and  \"Adonais\" (in memory of a friend, 1899); Symphonies, in C (1882), in B  (1885); an Andante for string orchestra (1884), and numerous pieces of  chamber-music. In the case of the cantata, \"The Lily Nymph,\"  Chadwick's art was quite futilized by the superb inanities of the book  he used. The \"Melpomene\" is a work of infinitely more specific  gravity. It is one of the most important of American orchestral works.    As his \"Thalia\" was an \"overture to an imaginary comedy,\" so this, to  an imaginary tragedy. It has been played by the Boston Symphony and  many other orchestras. It has that definiteness of mood with that  indefiniteness of circumstance in which music wins its most dignified  prosperity.        It opens with the solitary voice of the English horn, which      gives a notable pathos (read Berlioz on this despairful      elegist, and remember its haunting wail in the last act of      \"Tristan und Isolde\"). The woeful plaint of this voice      breathing above a low sinister roll of the tympanum      establishes at once the atmosphere of melancholy. Other      instruments join the wail, which breaks out wildly from the      whole orchestra. Over a waving accompaniment of clarinets,      the other wood-winds strike up a more lyric and hopeful      strain, and a soliloquy from the 'cello ends the slow      introduction, the materials of which are taken from the two      principal subjects of the overture, which is built on the      classic sonata formula. The first subject is announced by the      first violins against the full orchestra; the subsidiary      theme is given to the flutes and oboes; after a powerful      climax, and a beautiful subsidence of the storm in the lower      strings, the second subject appears in the relative major      with honeyed lyricism. The conclusion, which is made rather      elaborate by the latter-day symphonists, is reduced to a      brief modulation by Mr. Chadwick, and almost before one knows      it, he is in the midst of the elaboration. It is hard to say      whether the composer's emotion or his counterpoint is given      freer rein here, for the work is remarkable both for the      display of every technical resource and for the irresistible      tempest of its passion. In the reprise there is a climax that      thrills one even as he tamely reads the score, and must be      overpowering in actual performance: the cheerful consolation      of the second subject provokes a cyclonic outburst of grief;      there is a furious climax of thrilling flutes and violins      over a mad blare of brass, the while the cymbals shiver      beneath the blows of the kettledrum-sticks. An abrupt silence      prepares for a fierce thunderous clamor from the tympani and      the great drum (beaten with the sticks of the side-drum).      This subsides to a single thud of a kettledrum; there is      another eloquent silence; the English horn returns to its      first plaint; but grief has died of very exercise, and the      work ends in a coda that establishes a major harmony and      leaves the hearer with a heart purged white and clean.    The \"Melpomene\" overture is a work of such inspiration and such  scholarship that it must surely find a long youth in the chronicle of  our music.      _Arthur Foote._    [Illustration: ARTHUR FOOTE.]    [Illustration: Autograph of Arthur Foote]    The nearest approach Americans make to the enthusiastic German  _Maennerchor_ is in the college glee clubs. The dignity of their  selections is not always up to that of the Teutonic chorus, but they  develop a salutary fondness for color and shading, exaggerating both a  little perhaps, yet aiming at the right warmth and variety withal.  Even those elaborate paraphrases and circumlocutions of Mother Goose  rhymes, to which they are so prone, show a striving after dramatic  effect and richness of harmony, as well as a keen sense of wit and  humor that are by no means incompatible with real value in music.    Among their other good deeds must be counted the fostering of the  musical ambitions of Arthur Foote, who was for two years the leader of  the Glee Club of Harvard University. Though he has by no means been  content to delve no deeper into music than glee-club depths, I think  the training has been of value, and its peculiar character is patent  in his works. He is especially fond of writing for men's voices, and  is remarkably at home in their management, and he strives rather for  color-masses than for separate individualities in the voices.    Among his larger works for men's voices is an elaborate setting of  Longfellow's poem, \"The Skeleton in Armor,\" which is full of vigor and  generally sturdy in treatment, especially in its descriptions of  Viking war and seafaring. The storm-scenes, as in Mr. Foote's \"Wreck  of the Hesperus,\" seem faintly to suggest Wagnerian _Donner und  Blitzen_, but in general Mr. Foote has resisted the universal tendency  to copy the mannerisms so many take to be the real essence of the  Bayreuthian. A pretty bit of fancy is the use of a spinning-wheel  accompaniment to the love-song, although the spindle is nowhere  suggested by the poem. Indeed, the spinning is treated as a  characteristic motif for the Norseman's bride, somewhat as it is  Senta's motif in \"The Flying Dutchman.\"    The chief fault with the \"Skeleton\" chorus is that it is always  choric. There are no solos, and the different registers are never used  separately for more than a bar or two, before the whole mass chimes  in. Even the instrumental interludes are short, and the general effect  must be rather undiversified, one of sympathy, too, for the unrested  chorus.    \"The Wreck of the Hesperus\" is an ambitious work, built on large  lines, but hardly represents Mr. Foote at his best. It is for mixed  voices, and is pitched in a most lugubrious key, being always either  vociferous with panic or dismal with minor woe. A worse trouble yet is  the attempt to make a short poem fit a long composition. The  Procrustean operation strains even Longfellow sadly.    This blemish is lacking in \"The Farewell of Hiawatha,\" which is  written for men's voices. Though it, too, is of a sad tone, its sombre  hues are rich and varied as a tapestry. Its effects, though potent,  seem more sincere and less labored. It is altogether noble.    A larger body of sacred music for mixed voices than many other  Americans can boast, also swells Foote's opus-score. Here he shows the  same facility with the quartette as in his other works. In fact, I  think the effect of glee-club training on his young mind has strongly  influenced his whole life-work. And, by the way, the most talented of  all the great Sebastian Bach's twenty-one children--every one a  musical opus, too--was diverted from the philosopher's career for  which he was intended, and into professional musicianship, by just  such a glee-club training in the universities at Leipzig and  Frankfort.    Almost all of Foote's compositions are written in the close harmony  and limited range of vocal music, and he very rarely sweeps the  keyboard in his piano compositions, or hunts out startling novelties  in strictly pianistic effect. He is not fond of the cloudy regions of  the upper notes, and though he may dart brilliantly skyward now and  then just to show that his wings are good for lighter air, he is soon  back again, drifting along the middle ether.    He has won his high place by faithful adherence to his own sober,  serene ideals,"]]]
