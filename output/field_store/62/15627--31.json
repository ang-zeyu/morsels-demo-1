Algeria has the seventh-largest reserves of natural    gas in the world and is the second-largest gas exporter; it ranks    14th in oil reserves. Sustained high oil prices in recent years,    along with macroeconomic policy reforms supported by the IMF, have    helped improve Algeria's financial and macroeconomic indicators.    Algeria is running substantial trade surpluses and building up    record foreign exchange reserves. Real GDP has risen due to higher    oil output and increased government spending. The government's    continued efforts to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and    domestic investment outside the energy sector, however, has had    little success in reducing high unemployment and improving living    standards. Structural reform within the economy moves ahead slowly.    GDP (purchasing power parity):    $212.3 billion (2004 est.)    GDP - real growth rate:    6.1% (2004 est.)

Let us speak of the risks we are  running.\"    \"They would be immense, infinite, terrific, insurmountable, if, as I  have said, all things did not concur to render them of absolutely no  account. There is no danger either for you or for me, if the constancy  and intrepidity of your royal highness are equal to that perfection of  resemblance to your brother which nature has bestowed upon you. I repeat  it, there are no dangers, only obstacles; a word, indeed, which I find  in all languages, but have always ill-understood, and, were I king,  would have obliterated as useless and absurd.\"    \"Yes, indeed, monsieur; there is a very serious obstacle, an  insurmountable danger, which you are forgetting.\"    \"Ah!\" said Aramis.    \"There is conscience, which cries aloud; remorse, that never dies.\"    \"True, true,\" said the bishop; \"there is a weakness of heart of which  you remind me. You are right, too, for that, indeed, is an immense  obstacle. The horse afraid of the ditch, leaps into the middle of it,  and is killed! The man who trembling crosses his sword with that of  another leaves loopholes whereby his enemy has him in his power.\"    \"Have you a brother?\" said the young man to Aramis.    \"I am alone in the world,\" said the latter, with a hard, dry voice.    \"But, surely, there is some one in the world whom you love?\" added  Philippe.    \"No one!--Yes, I love you.\"    The young man sank into so profound a silence, that the mere sound of  his respiration seemed like a roaring tumult for Aramis. \"Monseigneur,\"  he resumed, \"I have not said all I had to say to your royal highness;  I have not offered you all the salutary counsels and useful resources  which I have at my disposal. It is useless to flash bright visions  before the eyes of one who seeks and loves darkness: useless, too, is  it to let the magnificence of the cannon's roar make itself heard in the  ears of one who loves repose and the quiet of the country. Monseigneur,  I have your happiness spread out before me in my thoughts; listen to my  words; precious they indeed are, in their import and their sense,  for you who look with such tender regard upon the bright heavens, the  verdant meadows, the pure air. I know a country instinct with  delights of every kind, an unknown paradise, a secluded corner of the  world--where alone, unfettered and unknown, in the thick covert of the  woods, amidst flowers, and streams of rippling water, you will forget  all the misery that human folly has so recently allotted you. Oh! listen  to me, my prince. I do not jest. I have a heart, and mind, and soul, and  can read your own,--aye, even to its depths. I will not take you unready  for your task, in order to cast you into the crucible of my own desires,  of my caprice, or my ambition. Let it be all or nothing. You are chilled  and galled, sick at heart, overcome by excess of the emotions which but  one hour's liberty has produced in you. For me, that is a certain and  unmistakable sign that you do not wish to continue at liberty. Would you  prefer a more humble life, a life more suited to your strength? Heaven  is my witness, that I wish your happiness to be the result of the trial  to which I have exposed you.\"    \"Speak, speak,\" said the prince, with a vivacity which did not escape  Aramis.    \"I know,\" resumed the prelate, \"in the Bas-Poitou, a canton, of which  no one in France suspects the existence. Twenty leagues of country is  immense, is it not? Twenty leagues, monseigneur, all covered with water  and herbage, and reeds of the most luxuriant nature; the whole studded  with islands covered with woods of the densest foliage. These large  marshes, covered with reeds as with a thick mantle, sleep silently and  calmly beneath the sun's soft and genial rays. A few fishermen with  their families indolently pass their lives away there, with their great  living-rafts of poplar and alder, the flooring formed of reeds, and the  roof woven out of thick rushes. These barks, these floating-houses, are  wafted to and fro by the changing winds. Whenever they touch a bank, it  is but by chance; and so gently, too, that the sleeping fisherman is not  awakened by the shock. Should he wish to land, it is merely because he  has seen a large flight of landrails or plovers, of wild ducks, teal,  widgeon, or woodchucks, which fall an easy pray to net or gun. Silver  shad, eels, greedy pike, red and gray mullet, swim in shoals into his  nets; he has but to choose the finest and largest, and return the others  to the waters. Never yet has the food of the stranger, be he soldier  or simple citizen, never has any one, indeed, penetrated into that  district. The sun's rays there are soft and tempered: in plots of solid  earth, whose soil is swart and fertile, grows the vine, nourishing with  generous juice its purple, white, and golden grapes. Once a week, a boat  is sent to deliver the bread which has been baked at an oven--the common  property of all. There--like the seigneurs of early days--powerful in  virtue of your dogs, your fishing-lines, your guns, and your beautiful  reed-built house, would you live, rich in the produce of the chase,  in plentitude of absolute secrecy. There would years of your life roll  away, at the end of which, no longer recognizable, for you would have  been perfectly transformed, you would have succeeded in acquiring a  destiny accorded to you by Heaven. There are a thousand pistoles in this  bag, monseigneur--more, far more, than sufficient to purchase the whole  marsh of which I have spoken; more than enough to live there as many  years as you have days to live; more than enough to constitute you the  richest, the freest, and the happiest man in the country. Accept it,  as I offer it you--sincerely, cheerfully. Forthwith, without a moment's  pause, I will unharness two of my horses, which are attached to the  carriage yonder, and they, accompanied by my servant--my deaf and dumb  attendant--shall conduct you--traveling throughout the night, sleeping  during the day--to the locality I have described; and I shall, at least,  have the satisfaction of knowing that I have rendered to my prince the  major service he himself preferred. I shall have made one human being  happy; and Heaven for that will hold me in better account than if I had  made one man powerful; the former task is far more difficult. And now,  monseigneur, your answer to this proposition? Here is the money. Nay,  do not hesitate. At Poitou, you can risk nothing, except the chance of  catching the fevers prevalent there; and even of them, the so-called  wizards of the country will cure you, for the sake of your pistoles. If  you play the other game, you run the chance of being assassinated on a  throne, strangled in a prison-cell. Upon my soul, I assure you, now I  begin to compare them together, I myself should hesitate which lot I  should accept.\"    \"Monsieur,\" replied the young prince, \"before I determine, let me alight  from this carriage, walk on the ground, and consult that still voice  within me, which Heaven bids us all to hearken to. Ten minutes is all I  ask, and then you shall have your answer.\"    \"As you please, monseigneur,\" said Aramis, bending before him with  respect, so solemn and august in tone and address had sounded these  strange words.        Chapter X. Crown and Tiara.    Aramis was the first to descend from the carriage; he held the door open  for the young man. He saw him place his foot on the mossy ground with  a trembling of the whole body, and walk round the carriage with an  unsteady and almost tottering step. It seemed as if the poor prisoner  was unaccustomed to walk on God's earth. It was the 15th of August,  about eleven o'clock at night; thick clouds, portending a tempest,  overspread the heavens, and shrouded every light and prospect underneath  their heavy folds. The extremities of the avenues were imperceptibly  detached from the copse, by a lighter shadow of opaque gray, which, upon  closer examination, became visible in the midst of the obscurity.  But the fragrance which ascended from the grass, fresher and more  penetrating than that which exhaled from the trees around him; the warm  and balmy air which enveloped him for the first time for many years  past; the ineffable enjoyment of liberty in an open country, spoke  to the prince in so seductive a language, that notwithstanding the  preternatural caution, we would almost say dissimulation of his  character, of which we have tried to give an idea, he could not restrain  his emotion, and breathed a sigh of ecstasy. Then, by degrees, he raised  his aching head and inhaled the softly scented air, as it was wafted in  gentle gusts to his uplifted face. Crossing his arms on his chest, as if  to control this new sensation of delight, he drank in delicious draughts  of that mysterious air which interpenetrates at night the loftiest  forests. The sky he was contemplating, the murmuring waters, the  universal freshness--was not all this reality? Was not Aramis a madman  to suppose that he had aught else to dream of in this world? Those  exciting pictures of country life, so free from fears and troubles,  the ocean of happy days that glitters incessantly before all young  imaginations, are real allurements wherewith to fascinate a poor,  unhappy prisoner, worn out by prison cares, emaciated by the stifling  air of the Bastile. It was the picture, it will be remembered, drawn  by Aramis, when he offered the thousand pistoles he had with him in  the carriage to the prince, and the enchanted Eden which the deserts of  Bas-Poitou hid from the eyes of the world. Such were the reflections of  Aramis as he watched, with an anxiety impossible to describe, the  silent progress of the emotions of Philippe, whom he perceived gradually  becoming more and more absorbed in his meditations. The young prince was  offering up an inward prayer to Heaven, to be divinely guided"]]]
