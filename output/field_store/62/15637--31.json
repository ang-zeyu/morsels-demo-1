The origin of the  word is by no means certain.  One explanation is that of  Mr. Fraser in quotation, 1892.  There may perhaps be an  etymological connection with the name <i>woomera</i> (q.v.),  which is a different weapon, being a throwing stick, that is,  an instrument with which to throw spears, whilst the  <i>boomerang</i> is itself thrown; but the idea of throwing is  common to both.  In many parts the word is pronounced by the  blacks bummerang.  Others connect it with the aboriginal word  for \"wind,\" which at Hunter River was <i>burramaronga</i>, also  <i>boomori</i>.  In New South Wales and South Queensland there  is a close correspondence between the terms for wind and  boomerang.    1827.  Captain P. P. King, `Survey of Intertropical and West  Coasts of Australia,' vol. i. p. 355:    \"Boomerang is the Port Jackson term for this weapon, and may  be retained for want of a more descriptive name.\"    1830.  R. Dawson, `Present State of Australia,' p. 108:    \"We gambolled all the way up, throwing small pieces of bark at  each other, after the manner of the native youths, who practise  this with a view of strengthening their arms, and fitting them  for hurling a curious weapon of war called a `bomering,' which  is shaped thus:\"                               \\                                \\                                /                               /    Ibid. p. 280:    \"Around their loins was the opossum belt, in one side of which  they had placed their waddies, with which they meant to break  the heads of their opponents, and on the other was the  bomering, or stick, with which they threw their spears.\"    [This is a confusion between <i>boomerang</i> and  <i>woomera</i> (q.v.).  Perhaps Mr. Dawson wrote the second  word, and this is a misprint.]    1839.  Major T. L. `Mitchell, `Three Expeditions into the  Interior of Eastern Australia,' vol. ii. p. 348:    \"The bommereng, or their usual missile, can be thrown by a  skilful hand, so as to rise upon the air, and thus to deviate  from the usual path of projectiles, its crooked course being,  nevertheless, equally under control.\"    1845.  R.  Howitt, `Australia,' p. 186:    \"The admirable dexterity with which they fling the bomerangs.  To our thinking the thrower was only sending the instrument  along the ground, when suddenly, after spinning along it a  little way, it sprung up into the air, performing a circle, its  crescent shape spinning into a ring, constantly spinning round  and round, until it came and fell at his feet.\"    1845.  O. Wendell Holmes, `Modest Request' (in Poems):    \"Like the strange missile which the Australian throws,   Your verbal boomerang slaps you on the nose.\"    1849.  J. P. Townsend, `Rambles in New South Wales,' p. 39:    \"This instrument, called a bommereng, is made of wood, and is  much like the blade of a scimitar.  I believe it has been  introduced into England as a plaything for children.\"    1850.  J. B. Clutterbuck, `Port Phillip in 1849,' p. 57:    \"The boomerang is an extraordinary missile, formed in the shape  of a crescent, and when propelled at an object, apparently  <i>point blank</i>, it turns in any direction intended by the  thrower, so that it can actually be directed in this manner  against a person standing by his side.  The consummate art  visible in its unnatural-looking progression greatly depends  upon the manner in which it is made to rebound from the ground  when thrown.\"    1865.  W.

Beveridge, `Aborigines of Victoria and Riverina,' p. 49:    \"Boomerang: a thin piece of wood, having the shape of a  parabola, about eighteen inches or two feet long from point to  point, the curve being on the thin side.  Of the broad sides of  the missile one is slightly convex, the other is flat.  The  thin sides are worked down finely to blunt edges.  The peculiar  curve of the missile gives it the property of returning to the  feet of the thrower.  It is a dangerous instrument in a melee.  Of course the wood from which it is made is highly seasoned by  fire.  It is therefore nearly as hard as flint.\"    1890.  C. Lumholtz, `Among Cannibals,' p. 49:    [A full description of the use of the boomerang is given,  with illustrations.]    \"The boomerang is a curved, somewhat flat, and slender weapon,  made from a hard and heavy wood, Brigalow (<i>Acacia  excelsa</i>), or Myall (<i>Acacia pendula</i>), but the best  one I found was made of a lighter kind of wood.  The curving of  the boomerang, which often approaches a right angle, must be  natural, and in the wood itself.  One side is perfectly flat,  and the other slightly rounded.  The ends are pointed.\"    1890.  G. W. Rusden, `Proceedings, Royal Colonial Institute,' vol.  xxii. p. 62:    \"You hardly ever see an allusion in the English Press to the  boomerang which does not refer to it as a weapon of war which  returns to the thrower, whereas the returning boomerang is not  a weapon of war, and the boomerang which is a weapon of war  does not return to the thrower.  There are many kinds of  boomerang--some for deadly strife, some for throwing at game,  and the returning boomerang, which is framed only for  amusement.  If a native had no other missile at hand, he would  dispatch it at a flight of ducks.  Its circular course,  however, makes it unfit for such a purpose, and there is a  special "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27995"],[0,"The History of London (#20)"],[1,"himself.    London with its narrow streets, its crowded courts, and the corners  where the huts and hovels of wood and daub and thatch stood among their  foul surroundings, a constant danger to the great houses of fire and  plague, was a city of great houses and palaces, with which no other city  in Europe could compare. Venice and Genoa had their Crosby Halls--their  merchants' palaces; but London had in addition, the town houses of all  the nobles of the land. In the City alone, without counting the Strand  and Westminster, there were houses of the Earls of Arundel,  Northumberland, Worcester, Berkeley, Oxford, Essex, Thanet, Suffolk,  Richmond, Pembroke, Abergavenny, Warwick, Leicester, Westmoreland. Then  there were the houses of the Bishops and the Abbots. All these before we  come to the houses of the rich merchants. Let your vision of London  under the Plantagenets be that of a city all spires and towers, great  churches and stately convents, with noble houses as great and splendid  as Crosby Hall scattered all about the City within the walls and lining  the river bank from Ludgate to Westminster.          35. AMUSEMENTS.      We have heard so much of the religious Houses, Companies, Hospitals,  quarrels and struggles that we may have forgotten a very important  element in the life of the City--the amusements and pastimes of the  citizens. Never was there a time when the City had more amusements than  in these centuries. You have seen that it was always a rich town: its  craftsmen were well paid: food was abundant: the people were well fed  always, except in times of famine, which were rare. There were taverns  with music and singing: there were pageants, wonderful processions  representing all kinds of marvels, devised by the citizens to please the  King or to please themselves: there were plays representing scenes from  the Bible and from the Lives of the Saints: there were tournaments to  look at. Then there were the Festivals of the year, Christmas Day,  Twelfth Day, Easter, the Day of St. John the Baptist, Shrove Tuesday,  the Day of the Company, May Day, at all of which feasting and merriment  were the rule. The young men, in winter, played at football, hockey,  quarterstaff, and single stick. They had cock fighting, boar fights, and  the baiting of bulls and bears. On May Day they erected a May-pole in  every parish: they chose a May Queen: and they had morris-dancing with  the lads dressed up as Robin Hood, Friar Tuck, Little John, Tom the  Piper, and other famous characters.    [Illustration: BEAR-BAITING.    (_From the Luttrell Psalter._)]    Then they shot with the bow and the cross-bow for prizes: they had  wrestlings and they had foot races.    The two great festivals of the year were the Eve of St. John the Baptist  and the Day of the Company.    [Illustration: SHOOTING AT THE BUTTS WITH THE LONG-BOW.]    On the former there took place the March of the Watch. Bonfires were lit  in the streets, not for warmth but in order to purge and cleanse the air  of the narrow streets: at the open doors stood tables with meat and  drink, neighbour inviting neighbour to hospitality. Then the doors were  wreathed with green branches, leaves, and flowers: lamps of glass were  hanging over them with oil burning all the night: some hung out branches  of iron curiously wrought with hundreds of hanging lights. And  everywhere the cheerful sounds of music and singing and the dancing of  the prentice lads and girls in the open street. Through the midst of  this joyousness filed the Watch. Four thousand men took part in this  procession which was certainly the finest thing that Mediaeval London had  to show. To light the procession on its way the City found two hundred  cressets or lanterns, the Companies found five hundred and the  constables of London, two hundred and fifty in number, each carried one.  The number of men who carried and attended to the cressets was two  thousand. Then followed the Watch itself, consisting of two thousand  captains, lieutenants, sergeants, drummers and fifers, standard bearers,  trumpeters, demilances on great horses, bowmen, pikemen, with  morris-dancers and minstrels--their armour all polished bright and some  even gilded. No painter has ever painted this March: yet of all things,  mediaeval, it was the most beautiful and the most mediaeval.    On the day of the Company, i.e. the Company's Saint's Day, all the  members assembled in the Hall, every man in a new livery, in the  morning. First they formed in procession and marched to church, headed  by priests and singing boys, in surplices: after these walked the  servants, clerks, assistants, the chaplain, the Mayor's sergeants, often  the Lord Mayor himself. Lastly came the Court with the Master and  Wardens followed by the Livery, i.e. the members.    After church they returned in like manner to the Hall, where a great  banquet awaited them, music played in the gallery: the banners of the  Company were hung over their heads: they burned scented wood: they sat  in order, Master and Wardens and illustrious guests at the high table:  and the freemen below, every man with his wife or some maiden if he were  unmarried. After dinner the loving cup went round: the minstrels led in  the players: and they had dramatic shows, songs, dances and 'mummeries'  for the rest of the day.    Do not think of mediaeval London as a dull place--it was full of life and  of brightness: the streets were narrow perhaps, but they were full of  colour from the bright dresses of all--the liveries of the  Companies--the liveries of the great nobles--the splendid costume of the  knights and richer class. The craftsman worked from daylight till curfew  in the winter: from five or six in the summer: he had a long day: but he  had three holidays: he had his evenings: and his Sundays. A dull time  was going to fall upon the Londoners, but not yet for two hundred years.          36. WESTMINSTER ABBEY.      Hitherto our attention has been confined to the City within the walls.  It is time to step outside the walls.    All this time, i.e. ever since peaceful occupation became possible, a  town had been growing up on the west side of London. You have seen that  formerly there spread a broad marsh over this part. Some rising ground  kept what is now the Strand above the river, but Westminster, except for  certain reed-grown islets, was nothing but a marsh covered over twice in  the day by the tide. The river thus spreading out over marshes on either  bank was quite shallow, and could in certain places be forded. The spot  where any ford existed afterwards became a ferry. Lambeth Bridge spans  the river at one such place, the memory of which is now maintained in  the name of the Horseferry Road. The largest of these islets was once  called Thorney, i.e. the Isle of Thorns. If you will take a map of  Westminster, shift the bank of the river so as to make it flow along  Abingdon Street, draw a stream running down College Street into the  Thames; another running into the Thames across King Street, and draw a  ditch or moat connecting the two streams along Delahaye Street and  Princes Street you will have Thorney, about a quarter of a mile long,  and not quite so much broad, standing just above high water level. This  was the original Precinct of Westminster.    [Illustration: TOMB OF EDWARD III. IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY.]    The Abbey of St. Peter's, Westminster, is said to have been founded on  the first conversion of the East Saxons, and at the same time as the  Foundation of St. Paul's. We know nothing about the foundation of the  church. During the Danish troubles the Abbey was deserted. It was  refounded by Dunstan. It was, however, rebuilt in much greater splendour  by Edward the Confessor. Of his work something still remains, and can be  pointed out to the visitor. But the present Abbey contains work by Henry  III., Edward I., Richard II.--Whittington being commissioner for the  work--Henry VII. and Wren, Hawksmoor and Gilbert Scott the architects.    There is no monument on British soil more venerable than Westminster  Abbey. You must not think that you know the place when you have visited  it once or twice. You must go there again and again. Every visit should  teach you something of your country and its history. The building itself  betraying to those who can read architecture the various periods at  which its builders lived: the beauty of the building, the solemnity of  the services--these are things which one must visit the Abbey often in  order to understand. Then there are the associations of the Abbey; the  things that have been done in the Abbey: the crowning of the Kings, in a  long line from Edward the Confessor downwards. Here Edward the Fourth's  Queen, Elizabeth Woodville, took sanctuary when her husband suffered  reverse: here the unfortunate Edward V. was born. Here the same unhappy  Queen brought her two boys when her husband died. Here Caxton set up his  first printing press: here is the coronation chair. Here is the shrine  of the sainted Edward the Confessor. It is robbed of its precious stones  and its gold: but the shrine is the same as that before which for five  hundred years people knelt as to the protector saint of England. This is  the burial-place of no fewer than twenty-six of our Kings and their  Queens. This is the sacred spot where we have buried most of our great  men. To name a few whose monuments you should look for, here are Sir  William Temple, Lord Chatham, Fox and Wilberforce, among statesmen; of  soldiers there are Prince Rupert and Monk; of Indian fame, here are Lord  Lawrence and Lord Clyde; of sailors, Blake, Cloudesley Shovel, and Lord  Dundonald. Of poets, Chaucer, Spenser, Beaumont, Ben Jonson, Dryden,  Prior, Addison, Gay, Campbell. Of historians and prose writers, Samuel  Johnson, Macaulay, Dickens, Livingston, Isaac Newton. Many others there  are to look for, notably the great poet Tennyson, buried here in October  "]]]
