For  see what you have called forth from unborn time.\"    He vanished.           *       *       *       *       *    Before the startled men could recover from the shock of it, the vibrant,  too-new voice went on:    \"I am sorry for you, Mundson, because, like you, I need specimens for my  experiments. What a splendid specimen you will be!\" His laugh was ugly  with significance. \"Get in, worms!\"    Unseen hands cuffed and pushed them into the sun-ship.    Inside, Dr. Mundson stumbled to the control room, white and drawn of  face, his great brain seemingly paralyzed by the catastrophe.    \"You needn't attempt tricks,\" went on the voice. \"I am watching you  both. You cannot even hide your thoughts from me.\"    And thus began the strange continuation of the journey. Not once, in  that wild half-hour's rush over the polar ice clouds, did they see Adam.  They saw and heard only the weird signs of his presence: a puffing cigar  hanging in midair, a glass of water swinging to unseen lips, a ghostly  voice hurling threats and insults at them.    Once the scientist whispered: \"Don't cross him; it is useless. John  Northwood, you'll have to fight a demigod for your woman!\"    Because of the terrific speed of the sun-ship, Northwood could  distinguish nothing of the topographical details below. At the end of  half-an-hour, the scientist slowed enough to point out a tall range of  snow-covered mountains, over which hovered a play of colored lights like  the _aurora australis_.    \"Behind those mountains,\" he said, \"is our destination.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Almost in a moment, the sun-ship had soared over the peaks. Dr. Mundson  kept the speed low enough for Northwood to see the splendid view below.    In the giant cup formed by the encircling mountain range was a green  valley of tropical luxuriance. Stretches of dense forest swept half up  the mountains and filled the valley cup with tangled verdure. In the  center, surrounded by a broad field and a narrow ring of woods, towered  a group of buildings. From the largest, which was circular, came the  auroralike radiance that formed an umbrella of light over the entire  valley.    \"Do I guess right,\" said Northwood, \"that the light is responsible for  this oasis in the ice?\"    \"Yes,\" said Dr. Mundson. \"In your American slang, it is canned sunshine  containing an overabundance of certain rays, especially the Life Ray,  which I have isolated.\" He smiled proudly. \"You needn't look startled,  my friend. Some of the most common things store sunlight. On very dark  nights, if you have sharp eyes, you can see the radiance given off by  certain flowers, which many naturalists say is trapped sunshine. The  familiar nasturtium and the marigold opened for me the way to hold  sunshine against the long polar night, for they taught me how to apply  the Einstein theory of bent light. Stated simply, during the polar  night, when the sun is hidden over the rim of the world, we steal some  of his rays; during the polar day we concentrate the light.\"    \"But could stored sunshine alone give enough warmth for the luxuriant  growth of those jungles?\"    \"An overabundance of the Life Ray is responsible for the miraculous  growth of all life in New Eden. The Life Ray is Nature's most powerful  force. Yet Nature is often niggardly and paradoxical in her use of her  powers. In New Eden, we have forced the powers of creation to take  ascendency over the powers of destruction.\"    At Northwood's sudden start, the scientist laughed and continued: \"Is it  not a pity that Nature, left alone, requires twenty years to make a man  who begins to die in another ten years? Such waste is not tolerated in  New Eden, where supermen are younger than babes and--\"    \"Come, worms; let's land.\"    It was Adam's voice. Suddenly he materialized, a blond god, whose eyes  and flesh were too new.           *       *       *       *       *    They were in a world of golden skylight, warmth and tropical vegetation.  The field on which they had landed was covered with a velvety green  growth of very soft, fine-bladed grass, sprinkled with tiny, star-shaped  blue flowers. A balmy, sweet-scented wind, downy as the breeze of a  dream, blew gently along the grass and tingled against Northwood's skin  refreshingly. Almost instantly he had the sensation of perfect well  being, and this feeling of physical perfection was part of the ecstasy  that seemed to pervade the entire valley. Grass and breeze and golden  skylight were saturated with a strange ether of joyousness.    At one end of the field was a dense jungle, cut through by a road that  led to the towering building from which, while above in the sun-ship,  they had seen the golden light issue.    From the jungle road came a man and a woman, large, handsome people,  whose flesh and eyes had the sinister newness of Adam's. Even before  they came close enough to speak, Northwood was aware that while they  seemed of Adam's breed, they were yet unlike him. The difference was  psychical rather than physical; they lacked the aura of hate and horror  that surrounded Adam. The woman drew Adam's head down and kissed him  affectionately on both cheeks.    Adam, from his towering height, patted her shoulder impatiently and  said: \"Run on back to the laboratory, grandmother. We're following  soon. You have some new human embryos, I believe you told me this  morning.\"    \"Four fine specimens, two of them being your sister's twins.\"    \"Splendid! I was sure that creation had stopped with my generation. I  must see them.\" He turned to the scientist and Northwood. \"You needn't  try to leave this spot. Of course I shall know instantly and deal with  you in my own way. Wait here.\"    He strode over the emerald grass on the heels of the woman.    Northwood asked: \"Why does he call that girl grandmother?\"    \"Because she is his ancestress.\" He stirred uneasily. \"She is of the  first generation brought forth in the laboratory, and is no different  from you or I, except that, at the age of five years, she is the  ancestress of twenty generations.\"    \"My God!\" muttered Northwood.    \"Don't start being horrified, my friend. Forget about so-called natural  laws while you are in New Eden. Remember, here we have isolated the Life  Ray. But look! Here comes your Athalia!\"           *       *       *       *       *    Northwood gazed covertly at the beautiful girl approaching them with a  rarely graceful walk. She was tall, slender, round-bosomed,  narrow-hipped, and she held her lovely body in the erect poise of  splendid health. Northwood had a confused realization of uncovered  bronzy hair, drawn to the back of a white neck in a bunch of short  curls; of immense soft black eyes; lips the color of blood, and  delicate, plump flesh on which the golden skylight lingered graciously.  He was instantly glad to see that while she possessed the freshness of  young girlhood, her skin and eyes did not have the horrible newness of  Adam's.    When she was still twenty feet distant, Northwood met her eyes and she  smiled shyly. The rich, red blood ran through her face; and he, too,  flushed.    She went to Dr. Mundson and, placing her hands on his thick shoulders,  kissed him affectionately.    \"I've been worried about you, Daddy Mundson.\" Her rich contralto voice  matched her exotic beauty. \"Since you and Adam had that quarrel the day  you left, I did not see him until this morning, when he landed the  sun-ship alone.\"    \"And you pleaded with him to return for us?\"    \"Yes.\" Her eyes drooped and a hot flush swept over her face.    Dr. Mundson smiled. \"But I'm back now, Athalia, and I've brought some  one whom I hope you will be glad to know.\"    Reaching for her hand, he placed it simply in Northwood's.    \"This is John, Athalia. Isn't he handsomer than the pictures of him  which I televisioned to you? God bless both of you.\"    He walked ahead and turned his back.           *       *       *       *       *    A magical half hour followed for Northwood and Athalia. The girl told  him of her past life, how Dr. Mundson had discovered her one year ago  working in a New York sweat shop, half dead from consumption. Without  friends, she was eager to follow the scientist to New Eden, where he  promised she would recover her health immediately.    \"And he was right, John,\" she said shyly. \"The Life Ray, that marvelous  energy ray which penetrates to the utmost depths of earth and ocean,  giving to the cells of all living bodies the power to grow and remain  animate, has been concentrated by Dr. Mundson in his stored sunshine.  The Life Ray healed me almost immediately.\"    Northwood looked down at the glorious girl beside him, whose eyes  already fluttered away from his like shy black butterflies. Suddenly he  squeezed the soft hand in his and said passionately:    \"Athalia! Because Adam wants you and will get you if he can, let us set  aside all the artificialities of civilization. I have loved you madly  ever since I saw your picture. If you can say the same to me, it will  give me courage to face what I know lies before me.\"    Athalia, her face suddenly tender, came closer to him.    \"John Northwood, I love you.\"    Her red lips came temptingly close; but before he could touch them, Adam  suddenly pushed his body between him and Athalia. Adam was pale, and all  the iciness was gone from his blue eyes, which were deep and dark and  very human. He looked down at Athalia, and she looked up at him, two  handsome specimens of perfect manhood and womanhood.    \"Fast work, Athalia!\" The new vibrant voice was strained. \"I was hoping  you would be disappointed in him, especially after having been wooed by  me this morning. I could take you if I wished, of course; but I prefer  to win you in the ancient manner. Dismiss him!\" He jerked his thumb over  his shoulder"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28681"],[0,"The Cook's Oracle; and Housekeeper's Manual (#20)"],[1,"  Strand.    The time meat will take roasting will vary according to the time it has  been kept, and the temperature of the weather; the same weight[77-*]  will be twenty minutes or half an hour longer in cold weather,[77-+]  than it will be in warm; and if fresh killed, than if it has been kept  till it is tender.    A good meat-screen is a great saver of fuel. It should be on wheels,  have a flat top, and not be less than about three feet and a half wide,  and with shelves in it, about one foot deep; it will then answer all the  purposes of a large Dutch oven, plate-warmer, hot hearth, &c. Some are  made with a door behind: this is convenient, but the great heat they are  exposed to soon shrinks the materials, and the currents of air through  the cracks cannot be prevented, so they are better without the door. We  have seen one, which had on the top of it a very convenient _hot  closet_, which is a great acquisition in kitchens, where the dinner  waits after it is dressed.    Every body knows the advantage of _slow boiling_. _Slow roasting_ is  equally important.    It is difficult to give any specific rule for time; but if your fire is  made as before directed, your meat-screen sufficiently large to guard  what you are dressing from currents of air, and the meat is not frosted,  you cannot do better than follow the old general rule of allowing rather  more than a quarter of an hour to the pound; a little more or less,  according to the temperature of the weather, in proportion as the piece  is thick or thin, the strength of the fire, the nearness of the meat to  it, and the frequency with which you baste it; the more it is basted the  less time it will take, as it keeps the meat soft and mellow on the  outside, and the fire acts with more force upon it.    Reckon the time, not to the hour when dinner is ordered, but to the  moment the roasts will be wanted. Supposing there are a dozen people to  sip soup and eat fish first, you may allow them ten or fifteen minutes  for the former, and about as long for the latter, more or less,  according to the temptations the \"BON GOUT\" of these preceding courses  has to attract their attention.    When the joint is half done, remove the spit and dripping-pan back, and  stir up your fire thoroughly, that it may burn clear and bright for the  browning; when the steam from the meat draws towards the fire,[78-*] it  is a sign of its being done enough; but you will be the best judge of  that, from the time it has been down, the strength of the fire you have  used, and the distance your spit has been from it.    Half an hour before your meat is done, make some gravy (_see Receipt_,  No. 326); and just before you take it up, put it nearer the fire to  brown it. If you wish to froth it, baste it, and dredge it with flour  carefully: you cannot do this delicately nice without a very good light.  The common fault seems to be using too much flour. The meat should have  a fine light varnish of froth, not the appearance of being covered with  a paste. Those who are particular about the froth use butter instead of  drippings; (see receipt to roast a turkey, No. 57)--        \"And send up what you roast with relish-giving froth,\"    says Dr. King, and present such an agreeable appearance to the eye, that  the palate may be prepossessed in its favour at first sight; therefore,  have the whole course dished, before roasts are taken from the fire.    A good cook is as anxiously attentive to the appearance and colour of  her roasts, as a court beauty is to her complexion at a birthday ball.  If your meat does not brown so much, or so evenly as you wish, take two  ounces of Glaze, _i. e._ portable soup, put four table-spoonfuls of  water, and let it warm and dissolve gradually by the side of the fire.  This will be done in about a quarter of an hour; put it on the meat  equally all over with a paste-brush the last thing before it goes to  table.    Though roasting is one of the most common, and is generally considered  one of the most easy and simple processes of cookery, it requires more  unremitting attention to perform it perfectly well than it does to make  most made-dishes.    That made-dishes are the most difficult preparations, deserves to be  reckoned among the culinary vulgar errors; in plain roasting and boiling  it is not easy to repair a mistake once made; and all the discretion and  attention of a steady, careful cook, must be unremittingly upon the  alert.[78-+]    A diligent attention to time, the distance of the meat from, and  judicious management of, the fire, and frequent bastings,[79-*] are all  the general rules we can prescribe. We shall deliver particular rules  for particular things, as the several articles occur, and do our utmost  endeavours to instruct our reader as completely as words can describe  the process, and teach        \"The management of common things so well,      That what was thought the meanest shall excel:      That cook's to British palates most complete,      Whose sav'ry skill gives zest to common meat:      For what are soups, your ragouts, and your sauce,      Compared to the fare of OLD ENGLAND,      And OLD ENGLISH ROAST BEEF!\"         * TAKE NOTICE, _that the_ TIME _given in the following receipts is       calculated for those who like meat thoroughly roasted._ (_See N.B.       preceding No. 19._)    Some good housewives order very large joints to be rather under-done, as  they then make a better hash or broil.

FOOTNOTES:    [74-*] Small families have not always the convenience of roasting with a  spit; a remark upon ROASTING BY A STRING is necessary. Let the cook,  _before_ she puts her meat down to the fire, pass a strong skewer  through _each end_ of the joint: by this means, when it is about  half-done, she can with ease turn the bottom upwards; the gravy will  then flow to the part which has been uppermost, and the whole joint be  deliciously gravyful.    A BOTTLE JACK, as it is termed by the furnishing ironmongers, is a  valuable instrument for roasting.    A DUTCH OVEN is another very convenient utensil for roasting light  joints, or warming them up.    [75-*] If there is more FAT than you think will be eaten with the lean,  trim it off; it will make an excellent PUDDING (No. 551, or 554): or  clarify it (No. 83).    [76-*] This the good housewife will take up occasionally, and pass  through a sieve into a stone pan; by leaving it all in the dripping-pan  until the meat is taken up, it not only becomes very strong, but when  the meat is rich, and yields much of it, it is apt to be spilt in  basting. To CLARIFY DRIPPINGS, see No. 83.    [77-*] _Insist upon the butcher fixing a_ TICKET _of the weight to each  joint._    [77-+] IF THE MEAT IS FROZEN, the usual practice is to put it into cold  water till it is thawed, then dry and roast it as usual; but we  recommend you to bring it into the kitchen the night before, or early in  the morning of the day you want to roast it, and the warm air will thaw  it much better.    [78-*] When the steam begins to arise, it is a proof that the whole  joint is thoroughly saturated with heat; any unnecessary evaporation is  a waste of the best nourishment of the meat.    [78-+] A celebrated French writer has given us the following  observations on roasting:--    \"The art of roasting victuals to the precise degree, is one of the most  difficult in this world; and _you may find half a thousand good cooks  sooner than one perfect roaster_. (See '_Almanach des Gourmands_,' vol.  i. p. 37.) In the mansions of the opulent, they have, besides the master  kitchener, a roaster, (perfectly independent of the former,) who is  exclusively devoted to the spit.    \"All erudite _gourmands_ know that these two important functions cannot  be performed by one artist; it is quite impossible at the same time to  superintend the operations of the spit and stewpan.\"--Further on, the  same author observes: \"No certain rules can be given for roasting, the  perfection of it depending on many circumstances which are continually  changing; the age and size (especially the thickness) of the pieces, the  quality of the coals, the temperature of the atmosphere, the currents of  air in the kitchen, the more or less attention of the roaster; and,  lastly, the time of serving. Supposing the dinner ordered to be on table  at a certain time, if the fish and soup are much liked, and detained  longer than the roaster has calculated; or, on the contrary, if they are  despatched sooner than is expected, the roasts will in one case be burnt  up, in the other not done enough--two misfortunes equally to be  deplored. The first, however, is without a remedy; _five minutes on the  spit, more or less, decides the goodness of this mode of cookery_. It is  almost impossible to seize the precise instant when it ought to be  eaten; which epicures in roasts express by saying, 'It is _done to a  turn_.' So that there is"]]]
