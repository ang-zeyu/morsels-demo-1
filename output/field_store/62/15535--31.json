There is a disposition to eat the woodwork of the stable,  earth, and, in fact, almost any substance within their reach. This  symptom must not, however, be considered as pathognomonic, since it is  observed when calculi are not present. Occasional colics may result from  these \"stomach stones,\" and when the latter lodge at the outlet of the  stomach they may give rise to symptoms of engorged stomach, already  described. There is, of course, no treatment that will prove effective.  Remedies to move the bowels, to relieve pain, and to combat inflammation  should be given.    _Intestinal concretions (calculi or stones in the intestines)._--These  concretions are usually found in the large bowels, though they are  occasionally seen in the small intestines. They are of various sizes,  weighing from 1 ounce to 25 pounds; they may be single or multiple, and  differ in composition and appearance, some being soft (composed mostly  of animal or vegetable matter), while others are porous, or honeycombed  (consisting of animal and mineral matter), and others are entirely hard  and stonelike. The hair balls, so common to the stomach and intestines  of cattle, are very rare in horses. Intestinal calculi form around some  foreign body, as a rule--a nail or piece of wood--whose shape they may  assume to a certain extent. Layers are arranged concentrically around  such nucleus until the sizes above spoken of are attained. These stones  are also often found in millers' horses, as well also as in horses in  limestone districts, where the water is hard. When the calculi attain a  sufficient size and become lodged or blocked in some part of the  intestines, they cause obstruction, inflammation of the bowels, colicky  symptoms, and death. There are no certain signs or symptoms that reveal  them. Recurring colics of the type of impaction colic, but more severe,  may lead one to suspect the existence of this condition. Examination  through the rectum may reveal the calculus.    The symptoms will be those of obstruction of the bowels. Upon  post-mortem examinations these stones will be discovered mostly in the  large bowels; the intestines will be inflamed or gangrenous about the  point of obstruction. Sometimes calculi have been expelled by the action  of a physic, or they may be removed by the hand when found to occupy the  rectum.    As in concretions of the stomach, but little can be done in the way of  treatment more than to overcome spasm (if any exists), and to give  physics with the hope of dislodging the stone or stones and carrying  them on and outward.    _Intussusception, or invagination._--This is the slipping of a portion  of the intestine into another portion immediately adjoining, like a  partially turned glove finger. This may occur at any part of the bowels,  but is most frequent in the small guts. The invaginated portion may be  slight--2 or 3 inches only--or extensive, measuring as many feet. In  intussusception, the inturned bowel is in the direction of the anus.  There are adhesions of the intestines at this point, congestion,  inflammation, or even gangrene. This accident is most liable to occur in  horses that are suffering from spasm of the bowel, or in those in which  a small portion of the gut is paralyzed. The natural wormlike or  ringlike contraction of the gut favors the passage of the contracted or  paralyzed portion into that immediately behind it. It may occur during  the existence of almost any abdominal trouble, as diarrhea, inflammation  of the bowels, or from injuries, exposure to cold, etc. A fall or  leaping may give the initial maldirection. Foals are most likely to be  thus afflicted.    Unless the invaginated portion of the gut becomes strangulated, probably  no symptoms except constipation will be appreciable. Strangulation of  the bowel may take place suddenly, and the horse die within 24 hours, or  it may occur after several days--a week even--and death then follow.  There are no symptoms positively diagnostic. Colicky pains, more or less  severe and continuous, are observed, and at first there may be diarrhea,  followed by constipation. Severe straining occurs in some instances of  intussusception, and when this occurs it should receive due credit. As  death approaches, the horse sweats profusely, sighs, presents an anxious  countenance, the legs and ears become cold, and there is often freedom  from pain immediately before death. In some rare instances he recovers,  even though the invaginated portion of the gut has become strangulated.  In this case the imprisoned portion sloughs away so gradually that a  union has taken place between the intestines at the point where one  portion has slipped into that behind it. The piece sloughing off is  found passed with the manure. Such cases are exceedingly rare.  Nonirritating laxatives, such as castor oil, sweet oil, or calomel in  small doses, should be given. Soft feed and mucilaginous and nourishing  drinks should be given during these attacks. E. Mayhew Michener has  operated successfully on a foal with intussusception by opening the  abdomen and releasing the imprisoned gut.    _Volvulus, gut tie, or twisting of the bowels._--These are the terms  applied to the bowels when twisted or knotted. This accident is rather a  common one, and frequently results from the violent manner in which a  horse throws himself about when attacked by spasmodic colic. The  symptoms are the same as those of intussusception and obstructions of  the bowels; the same directions as to treatment are therefore to be  observed.    _Paralysis of the intestine._--This occurs in old, debilitated animals  that have been fed on coarse, innutritious fodder. This produces a  condition of dilatation so pronounced as to make it impossible for the  intestine to advance its contents, and so obstruction results. The  symptoms are as in other forms of obstruction colic. The history of the  case is of much service in diagnosing the trouble. The treatment  consists in the administration of laxatives. One may give 1 quart of raw  linseed oil and follow it the next day with 1 pound of Glauber's salt  dissolved in a quart of warm water. Strychnia may be given in doses of 1  grain two or three times daily. If the stagnant mass of feces is in the  rectum, it must be removed with the hand.    _Abnormal growths_, such as tumors or fibrous tissue, producing  contraction or stricture, may be causes of obstruction. The colic caused  by these conditions is chronic. The attacks occur at gradually  shortening intervals and become progressively more severe. Relief is  afforded by the use of purgatives that render the feces soft and thin  and thus enable them to pass the obstruction, but in time the contracted  place is liable to close so far that passage is impossible and the horse  will die.    FLATULENT COLIC (TYMPANITIC COLIC, WIND COLIC, OR BLOAT).--Among the  most frequent causes of this form of colic are to be mentioned sudden  changes of feed, too long fasting and feed then given while the animal  is exhausted, new hay or grain, large quantities of feed that is green  or that has lain in the manger for some time and become sour,  indigestible feed, irregular teeth, crib biting, and, in fact, anything  that produces indigestion may produce flatulent colic.    _Symptoms._--The symptoms of wind colic are not so suddenly developed  nor so severe as those of cramp colic. At first the horse is noticed to  be dull, paws slightly, and may or may not lie down. The pains from the  start are continuous. The belly enlarges, and by striking it in front of  the haunches a drumlike sound results. If not soon relieved the above  symptoms are aggravated, and in addition difficult breathing, bloodshot  eyes, and red mucous membranes, loud tumultuous heart beat, profuse  perspiration, trembling of front legs, sighing respiration, staggering  from side to side are noticed, and, finally, plunging forward dead. The  diagnostic symptom of flatulent colic is the distention of the bowels  with gas, detected by the bloated appearance and resonance on  percussion.    _Treatment._--The treatment for wind colic differs very greatly from  that of cramp colic. Absorbents are of some service, and charcoal may be  given in any quantity. Relaxants and antispasmodics are also beneficial  in this form of colic. Chloral hydrate not only possesses these  qualities, but it also is an antiferment and a pain reliever. It is,  then, particularly well adapted to the treatment of wind colic, and  should be given in the same-sized doses and in the manner directed for  spasmodic colic. Diluted alcohol or whisky may be given, or aromatic  spirits of ammonia in 1-ounce doses at short intervals.    A physic should always be given as early as possible in flatulent colic,  the best being Barbados aloes in the dose already mentioned. Injections,  per rectum, of turpentine 1 to 2 ounces, linseed oil 8 ounces, may be  given frequently to stimulate the peristaltic motion of the bowels and  to favor the escape of wind. Blankets wrung out of hot water do much to  afford relief; they should be renewed every 5 or 10 minutes and covered  with a dry woolen blanket. This form of colic is much more fatal than  cramp colic, and requires prompt and persistent treatment. It is  entirely unsafe to predict the result, some apparently mild attacks  going on to speedy death, while others that at the onset appear to be  very severe yielding rapidly to treatment. No efforts should be spared  until the animal is known to be dead. In these severe cases puncturing  of the bowels in the most prominent (distended) part by means of a small  trocar and cannula or with a needle of a hypodermic syringe, thus  allowing the escape of gas, has often saved life, and such punctures, if  made with a clean, sharp instrument that is not allowed to remain in the  horse too long,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23475"],[0,"The Works of Lord Byron.
