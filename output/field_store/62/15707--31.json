The feathers are shipped to  regular feather dealers or manufacturers.    [Illustration: FIG. 49. A valuable by-product of duck plants. The  feathers from a duck will pay for the cost of picking. (_Photograph from  the Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S. Department of Agriculture._)]    _Prices and Uses of Duck Feathers._ The soft body feathers and the  coarser feathers often called \"sweepings\" should be kept and sold  separate. While scalded feathers are not worth as much as dry picked  feathers, the former if properly dried out or cured will find a ready  sale. Feathers packed before they are thoroughly dried out, are likely  to arrive at their destination in a matted and musty or heated  condition. This, of course, injures their quality and the price paid for  them is discounted according to their condition.    The soft body feathers of ducks are used almost entirely for bedding  purposes, that is, are put in pillows and feather beds. White feathers  are preferred and usually bring a somewhat higher price.    The prices paid for the feathers vary quite widely at different times of  the year, and in different sections of the country, and also of course  with the condition of the feathers themselves. The quotations given  below represent the prices paid in June, 1921.

This is due to the fact that the duck growers find it more profitable to  incubate all eggs suitable for that purpose and to rear and market the  ducklings rather than to sell the eggs. There are always, however, a  certain number of cracked eggs and others which may be too large or too  small to use for hatching and which are therefore marketed. In addition  the infertile eggs tested out on the 5th day are sold. The eggs may be  packed in ordinary 30 dozen egg cases such as are used for hens' eggs,  utilizing a special filler 5 cells square. With these fillers a case  holds 20 5-6 dozen duck eggs. A special duck case, holding 30 dozen duck  eggs may be used, the fillers in this case being 6 cells square like the  fillers used for hens' eggs. The cells in these fillers are 2 inches  square and 2-1/4 or 2-1/2 inches deep.          CHAPTER VIII    Duck Raising on the Farm      Duck raising as ordinarily conducted on the general farm consists of the  keeping of a comparatively small flock purely as a side line. Ducks on  the general farm may be kept for the production of meat and eggs, for  egg production, or mainly as a breeding proposition where the idea is to  produce birds of exhibition quality. On occasional farms ducks of the  rarer breeds are kept mainly for ornamental purposes.    _Conditions Suitable for Duck Raising._ A small flock of ducks on the  farm can be kept to best advantage where they can be separated from the  other poultry and where they can have access to a pasture or an orchard  which will provide them with a plentiful supply of green feed. Ducks  stand confinement quite well but if they are closely confined it is  necessary to provide for them the green feed which they cannot secure  for themselves. On many farms the flock of ducks is allowed to range at  liberty and under these conditions the cost of maintaining them is much  lower since they pick up a considerable part of their feed. An enclosed  run or yard, however, should be available where they can be confined  when desired. It is also necessary to provide a house or shed in which  they can be shut at night and during the early morning. Otherwise, many  of the eggs may be dropped anywhere about the place or in the water with  the result that some of them will be lost. A pond or stream to which the  ducks can have access and in which they can swim is a great advantage  since it helps to keep them in good breeding condition. It is a common  but mistaken idea that low, wet land is best suited for ducks.    _Size of Flock._--The average farm flock of ducks is small, rarely  running over 15 to 20 head. In many cases not over 10 or 12 ducks with  one or two drakes will be kept. A flock of this size will furnish quite  a large number of ducks for the farmer's table or for sale in addition  to more or less eggs which can either be used at home or sold.    _Making a Start._ In making a start with a farm flock of ducks it is  probably best to figure on keeping only a few head. If the farmer begins  with 4 or 5 ducks and one drake he can make his start at small expense  and from this number he will be able to increase the size of his flock  if he finds that results warrant it. Probably the best way to make a  start is to purchase the desired breeding stock in the fall. This will  give the ducks a chance to get settled and to be in good condition and  accustomed to their quarters by spring so that they will begin to breed  and lay.    Eggs for hatching can be purchased if desired and the young ducklings  hatched and reared with chicken hens. Baby ducks are rarely purchased in  making a start as are baby chicks.    _Selecting the Breed._ Any one of the breeds forming the so-called meat  class will prove satisfactory for a farm flock. This class includes the  Pekin, Aylesbury, Muscovy, Rouen, Cayuga, Buff and Blue Swedish. The  birds of any of these breeds are of good size and therefore produce a  suitable table fowl. At the same time they are layers and will produce  eggs for the table or for market as well. Where the purpose in keeping  the ducks is mainly that of producing eggs for market the Runner is  undoubtedly the breed to select. While these ducks are smaller in size  the ducklings will make good carcasses of broiler size for the table  being killed for this purpose when about 2-1/2 to 3 pounds in weight. In  addition, the Runner is the best laying breed and by many persons is  considered to be equal in its egg producing qualities to any of the  breeds of chickens.    Selection of any breed or variety of the meat or egg classes and  especially the selection of a breed or variety for ornamental purposes  or for the pleasure of breeding will depend upon the individual  preference of the owner for body shape, color of plumage and other  characteristics. A pure breed of some kind should by all means be kept  in preference to the common or so-called \"puddle\" duck. Not only will  the pure breeds give greater uniformity in the carcasses produced but  the results in egg production will likewise be better.    _Age of Breeding Stock._ The best results in breeding are secured from  ducks during their first laying season. Not only is egg production  better but they are less likely to become so fat and large as to  interfere with the fertility and hatchability of the eggs. In fact, on  commercial duck farms the breeding stock is entirely renewed each year.  However, ducks can be profitably kept until they are 2 or 3 years old,  and it is common practice in a farm flock to hold over some of the  breeders after they have finished their first year. Of course, where the  duck breeder has some especially fine stock which will produce just the  quality he desires in the offspring, he holds and utilizes these birds  just as long as they are in good breeding condition. As a rule it is  best not to hold breeding ducks after they have finished their second  laying season.    _Size of Matings._ The proper number of ducks which should be mated to a  drake varies with the different breeds. Pekins and Aylesbury can be  mated in the proportion of one drake to 6 to 8 ducks. In the Rouen mate  4 or 5 ducks to a drake and in the Cayuga 5 or 6 ducks to a drake. In  the Muscovy as high as 10 females may be mated with one male. In the  Blue Swedish and Buff mate in the proportion of 6 or 7 ducks to one  drake. In the Call and East India breeds from 5 to 8 ducks can be mated  to one drake. In the Crested White use 5 or 6 ducks and in the Runner  6 to 8 ducks to a drake.    Where young drakes are used more ducks can be mated to them than is the  case with old drakes. It is also true that where especially large  exhibition birds have been reserved for breeding purposes it is  necessary to reduce the number of ducks mated to a drake as otherwise  the fertility is very likely to run lower with these older heavier  ducks.    _Breeding and Laying Season._ Under ordinary farm conditions where the  ducks receive only fairly good care and feed the laying does not begin  to any extent until February or March. With exceptional care the ducks  will begin to lay in January and a few may even lay in December. The  ducks lay very persistently and continue their laying until hot weather  sets in or usually about the first of July. They gradually let up in  their laying until it ceases almost entirely soon after that date. The  breeding season is at its height in the months of April and May. At this  time the fertility will run best and the results in hatching will be  most satisfactory. However, it is possible to continue to hatch the duck  eggs which are produced with fair results as long as the ducks continue  to lay.      Management of Breeders.    _Housing._ Some sort of house or shelter must be provided for the  breeding flock. Any available shed or a part of the poultry house may  be utilized for this purpose. No special requirements are necessary  except that the house should provide sufficient ventilation. This is  best furnished by means of a window and in addition, an opening in the  front of the house should be provided which can be closed by means of a  curtain during severe winter weather.

This was a common bird in the lowlands away from forest. I observed       it feeding on lawns in Tawau. A pair was building a nest on July       19, 1962, in an ironwood tree about 10 feet above the ground. The       nest was typically ball-shaped with a side entrance. This species       appears to stay in age groups when it flocks, as evidenced by the       large flocks of young in first-year plumage.         The hermaphroditic specimen was of some interest, since the ovary       and testis both seemed to be enlarged.          LITERATURE CITED      Amadon, D.         1956.
