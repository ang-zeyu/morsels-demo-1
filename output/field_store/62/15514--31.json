It was  Phineus, he who had been betrothed to Andromeda, yet who had not dared  to strike a blow for her rescue. Straight at Perseus they rushed, and  fierce was the fight that then began. But of a sudden, from the  goatskin where it lay hid, Perseus drew forth the head of Medusa, and  Phineus and his warriors were turned into stone.    For seven days the marriage feast lasted, but on the eighth night  Pallas Athene came to Perseus in a dream.    \"Nobly and well hast thou played the hero, O son of Zeus!\" she said;  \"but now that thy toil is near an end and thy sorrows have ended in  joy, I come to claim the shoes of Hermes, the helmet of Pluto, the  sword, and the shield that is mine own. Yet the head of the Gorgon  must thou yet guard awhile, for I would have it laid in my temple at  Seriphos that I may wear it on my shield for evermore.\"    As she ceased to speak, Perseus awoke, and lo, the shield and helmet  and the sword and winged shoes were gone, so that he knew that his  dream was no false vision.    Then did Perseus and Andromeda, in a red-prowed galley made by cunning  craftsmen from Phoenicia, sail away westward, until at length they  came to the blue water of the AEgean Sea, and saw rising out of the  waves before them the rocks of Seriphos. And when the rowers rested on  their long oars, and the red-prowed ship ground on the pebbles of the  beach, Perseus and his bride sought Danae, the fair mother of Perseus.    Black grew the brow of the son of Danae when she told him what cruel  things she had suffered in his absence from the hands of Polydectes  the king. Straight to the palace Perseus strode, and there found the  king and his friends at their revels. For seven years had Perseus been  away, and now it was no longer a stripling who stood in the palace  hall, but a man in stature and bearing like one of the gods.  Polydectes alone knew him, and from his wine he looked up with mocking  gaze.    \"So thou hast returned? oh nameless son of a deathless god,\" he said.  \"Thou didst boast, but methinks thy boast was an empty one!\"    But even as he spoke, the jeering smile froze on his face, and the  faces of those who sat with him stiffened in horror.    \"O king,\" Perseus said, \"I swore that, the gods helping me, thou  shouldst have the head of Medusa. The gods have helped me. Behold the  Gorgon's head.\"    Wild horror in their eyes, Polydectes and his friends gazed on the  unspeakable thing, and as they gazed they turned into stone--a ring of  grey stones that still sit on a hillside of Seriphos.    With his wife and his mother, Perseus then sailed away, for he had a  great longing to take Danae back to the land of her birth and to see  if her father, Acrisius, still lived and might not now repent of his  cruelty to her and to his grandson. But there he found that the sins  of Acrisius had been punished and that he had been driven from his  throne and his own land by a usurper. Not for long did the sword of  Perseus dwell in its scabbard, and speedily was the usurper cast  forth, and all the men of Argos acclaimed Perseus as their glorious  king. But Perseus would not be their king.    \"I go to seek Acrisius,\" he said. \"My mother's father is your king.\"    Again his galley sailed away, and at last, up the long Euboean Sea  they came to the town of Larissa, where the old king now dwelt.    A feast and sports were going on when they got there, and beside the  king of the land sat Acrisius, an aged man, yet a kingly one indeed.    And Perseus thought, \"If I, a stranger, take part in the sports and  carry away prizes from the men of Larissa, surely the heart of  Acrisius must soften towards me.\"    Thus did he take off his helmet and cuirass, and stood unclothed  beside the youths of Larissa, and so godlike was he that they all  said, amazed, \"Surely this stranger comes from Olympus and is one of  the Immortals.\"    In his hand he took a discus, and full five fathoms beyond those of  the others he cast it, and a great shout arose from those who watched,  and Acrisius cried out as loudly as all the rest.    \"Further still!\" they cried. \"Further still canst thou hurl! thou art  a hero indeed!\"    And Perseus, putting forth all his strength, hurled once again, and  the discus flew from his hand like a bolt from the hand of Zeus. The  watchers held their breath and made ready for a shout of delight as  they saw it speed on, further than mortal man had ever hurled before.  But joy died in their hearts when a gust of wind caught the discus as  it sped and hurled it against Acrisius, the king. And with a sigh like  the sigh that passes through the leaves of a tree as the woodman fells  it and it crashes to the earth, so did Acrisius fall and lie prone. To  his side rushed Perseus, and lifted him tenderly in his arms. But the  spirit of Acrisius had fled. And with a great cry of sorrow Perseus  called to the people:    \"Behold me! I am Perseus, grandson of the man I have slain! Who can  avoid the decree of the gods?\"    For many a year thereafter Perseus reigned as king, and to him and to  his fair wife were born four sons and three daughters. Wisely and well  he reigned, and when, at a good old age, Death took him and the wife  of his heart, the gods, who had always held him dear, took him up  among the stars to live for ever and ever. And there still, on clear  and starry nights, we may see him holding the Gorgon's head. Near him  are the father and mother of Andromeda--Cepheus and Cassiopeia, and  close beside him stands Andromeda with her white arms spread out  across the blue sky as in the days when she stood chained to the rock.  And those who sail the watery ways look up for guidance to one whose  voyaging is done and whose warfare is accomplished, and take their  bearings from the constellation of Cassiopeia.          NIOBE        \"... Like Niobe, all tears.\"            Shakespeare.      The quotation is an overworked quotation, like many another of those  from _Hamlet_; yet, have half of those whose lips utter it more than  the vaguest acquaintance with the story of Niobe and the cause of her  tears? The noble group--attributed to Praxiteles--of Niobe and her  last remaining child, in the Uffizi Palace at Florence, has been so  often reproduced that it also has helped to make the anguished figure  of the Theban queen a familiar one in pictorial tragedy, so that as  long as the works of those Titans of art, Shakespeare and Praxiteles,  endure, no other monument is wanted for the memory of Niobe.    Like many of the tales of mythology, her tragedy is a story of  vengeance wreaked upon a mortal by an angry god. She was the daughter  of Tantalus, and her husband was Amphion, King of Thebes, himself a  son of Zeus. To her were born seven fair daughters and seven beautiful  and gallant sons, and it was not because of her own beauty, nor her  husband's fame, nor their proud descent and the greatness of their  kingdom, that the Queen of Thebes was arrogant in her pride. Very sure  she was that no woman had ever borne children like her own children,  whose peers were not to be found on earth nor in heaven. Even in our  own day there are mortal mothers who feel as Niobe felt.    But amongst the Immortals there was also a mother with children whom  she counted as peerless. Latona, mother of Apollo and Diana, was  magnificently certain that in all time, nor in eternity to come, could  there be a son and daughter so perfect in beauty, in wisdom, and in  power as the two that were her own. Loudly did she proclaim her proud  belief, and when Niobe heard it she laughed in scorn.    \"The goddess has a son and a daughter,\" she said. \"Beautiful and wise  and powerful they may be, but I have borne seven daughters and seven  sons, and each son is more than the peer of Apollo, each daughter more  than the equal of Diana, the moon-goddess!\"    And to her boastful words Latona gave ear, and anger began to grow in  her heart.    Each year the people of Thebes were wont to hold a great festival in  honour of Latona and her son and daughter, and it was an evil day for  Niobe when she came upon the adoring crowd that, laurel-crowned, bore  frankincense to lay before the altars of the gods whose glories they  had assembled together to celebrate.    \"Oh foolish ones!\" she said, and her voice was full of scorn, \"am I  not greater than Latona? I am the daughter of a goddess, my husband,  the king, the son of a god. Am I not fair? am I not queenly as Latona  herself? And, of a surety, I am richer by far than the goddess who has  but one daughter and one son. Look on my seven noble sons! behold the  beauty of my seven daughters, and see if they in beauty and all else  do not equal the dwellers in Olympus!\"    And when the people looked, and shouted aloud, for in truth Niobe and  her children were like unto gods, their queen said, \"Do not waste thy  worship, my people. Rather make the prayers to thy king and to me and  to my children who buttress us round and make our strength so great,  that fearlessly we can despise the gods.\"    In her home on the Cynthian mountain top, Latona heard the arrogant  words of the queen of Thebes, and even as a gust of wind blows  smouldering ashes into a consuming fire, her growing anger flamed into  rage. She called Apollo and Diana to her, and commanded them to avenge  the blasphemous insult which had been given to them and to their  mother. And the twin gods listened with burning hearts.    \"Truly shalt thou be avenged!\" cried Apollo. \"The shameless one shall  learn that not unscathed goes she who profanes the honour of the  mother of the deathless gods!\"    And with their silver bows in their hands, Apollo, the smiter from  afar, and Diana, the virgin huntress, hasted to Thebes. There they  found all the noble youths of the kingdom pursuing their sports. Some  rode, some were having chariot-"]]]
