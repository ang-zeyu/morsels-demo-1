Thus it would seem that the bird's  mood is the gayest when his favorite stream is dashing at its noisiest  and most rapid pace down the steep mountain defiles. The clamor of the  stream often drowns the song of the bird, the movement of his mandibles  being seen when not a sound from his music-box can be heard. There must  be a feeling of fellowship between the bird and the stream he loves so  well.    [Illustration: \"_No snowstorm can discourage him_\"]    You will not be surprised to learn that the dipper is an extremely hardy  bird. No snowstorm, however violent, can discourage him, but in the  midst of it all he sings his most cheerful lays, as if defying all the  gods of the winds. While other birds, even the hardy nuthatches, often  succumb to discouragement in cold weather, and move about with  fluffed-up feathers, the very picture of dejection--not so the little  dipper, who always preserves his cheerful temper, and is ready to say,  in acts, if not in words: \"Isn't this the jolliest weather you ever  saw?\" Away up in Alaska, where the glaciers hold perpetual sway, this  bird has been seen in the month of November as glad and blithesome as  were his comrades in the summery gorges of New Mexico.          PLAINS AND FOOTHILLS    [Illustration: PLATE V    LOUISIANA TANAGER--_Pyranga ludoviciana_  (Upper figure, male; lower, female)]      The foregoing chapters contain a recital of observations made in the  neighborhood of Colorado Springs and in trips on the plains and among  the mountains in that latitude. Two years later--that is, in 1901--the  rambler's good angel again smiled upon him and made possible another  tour among the Colorado mountains. This time he made Denver, instead of  Colorado Springs, the centre of operations; nor did he go alone, his  companion being an active boy of fourteen who has a penchant for  Butterflies, while that of the writer, as need scarcely be said, is for  the Birds--in our estimation, the two cardinal B's of the English  language. Imagine two inveterate ramblers, then, with two such  enchanting hobbies, set loose on the Colorado plains and in the  mountains, with the prospect of a month of uninterrupted indulgence in  their manias!    In the account of my first visit, most of the species met with were  described in detail both as to their habits and personal appearance. In  the present record no such minutiae will be necessary so far as the same  species were observed, and therefore the chief objects of the following  chapters will be, first, to note the diversities in the avian fauna of  the two regions; second, to give special attention to such birds as  either were not seen in my first visit or were for some cause partly  overlooked; and, third, to trace the peculiar transitions in bird life  in passing from the plains about Denver to the crest of Gray's Peak,  including jaunts to several other localities.    In my rambles in the neighborhood of Denver only a few species not  previously described were observed, and yet there were some noteworthy  points of difference in the avi-fauna of the two latitudes, which are  only about seventy-five miles apart. It will perhaps be remembered that,  in the vicinity of Colorado Springs and Manitou, the pretty lazuli  buntings were quite rare and exceedingly shy, only two or three  individuals having been seen. The reverse was the case in the suburbs of  Denver and on the irrigated plains between that city and the mountains,  and also in the neighborhood of Boulder, where in all suitable haunts  the lazulis were constantly at my elbow, lavish enough of their pert  little melodies to satisfy the most exacting, and almost as familiar and  approachable as the indigo-birds of the East. It is possible that, for  the most part, the blue-coated beauties prefer a more northern latitude  than Colorado Springs for the breeding season.    At the latter place I failed to find the burrowing owl, although there  can be little doubt of his presence there, especially out on the  plains. Not far from Denver one of these uncanny, sepulchral birds was  seen, having been frightened from her tunnel as I came stalking near it.  She flew over the brow of the hill in her smooth, silent way, and  uttered no syllable of protest as I examined her domicile--or, rather,  the outside of it. Scattered about the dark doorway were a number of  bones, feathers, and the skin of a frog, telling the story of the _table  d'hote_ set by this underground dweller before her nestlings. She might  have put up the crossbones and skull as a sign at the entrance to her  burrow, or even placed there the well-known Dantean legend, \"All hope  abandon, ye who enter here,\" neither of which would have been more  suggestive than the telltale litter piled up before her door. When I  chased her from her hiding-place, she flew down the hill and alighted on  a fence-post in the neighborhood of her nest, uttering several screechy  notes as I came near her again, as if she meant to say that I was  carrying the joke a little too far in pursuing her about. Presently she  circled away on oily wings, and I saw her no more.    [Illustration: \"_The dark doorway_\"]    So little enthusiasm does such a bird stir within me that I felt too  lazy to follow her about on the arid plain. It may be interesting as a  matter of scientific information to know that the burrowing owl breeds  in a hole in the ground, and keeps company with the prairie dog and the  rattlesnake, but a bird that lives in a gloomy, malodorous cave, whose  manners are far from attractive, and whose voice sounds as strident as a  buzz-saw--surely such a bird can cast no spell upon the observer who is  interested in the aesthetic side of bird nature. A recent writer, in  describing \"A Buzzards' Banquet,\" asks a couple of pregnant questions:  \"Is there anything ugly out of doors? Can the ardent, sympathetic lover  of nature ever find her unlovely?\" To the present writer these questions  present no Chinese puzzle. He simply brushes all speculation and  theorizing aside by responding \"Yes,\" to both interrogatories, on the  principle that it is sometimes just as well to cut the Gordian knot as  to waste precious time trying to untie it. The burrowing owl makes me  think of a denizen of the other side of the river Styx, and why should  one try to love that which nature has made unattractive, especially when  one cannot help one's feeling?    In the preceding chronicles no mention, I believe, has been made of one  little bird that deserves more than a mere _obiter dictum_. My first  meeting with the blithesome house-finch of the West occurred in the city  of Denver, in 1899. It could not properly be called a formal  presentment, but was none the less welcome on that account. I had  scarcely stepped out upon the busy street before my ear was accosted by  a kind of half twitter and half song that was new to me. \"Surely that is  not the racket of the English sparrow; it is too musical,\" I remarked to  a friend walking by my side.    Peering among the trees and houses, I presently focussed my field-glass  upon a small, finch-like bird whose coat was striped with gray and  brown, and whose face, crown, breast, and rump were beautifully tinged  or washed with crimson, giving him quite a dressy appearance. What could  this chipper little city chap be, with his trig form and well-bred  manners, in such marked contrast with those of the swaggering English  sparrow? Afterwards he was identified as the house-finch, which rejoices  in the high-sounding Latin name of _Carpodacus mexicanus frontalis_. His  distribution is restricted to the Rocky Mountain district chiefly south  of the fortieth parallel of north latitude.    He is certainly an attractive species, and I wish we could offer  sufficient inducements to bring him east. A bird like him is a boon and  an ornament to the streets and parks of any city that he graces with  his presence and enlivens with his songs. No selfish recluse is he; no,  indeed! In no dark gulch or wilderness, far from human neighborhood,  does he sulkily take up his abode, but prefers the companionship of man  to the solitudes of nature, declaring in all his conduct that he likes  to be where there are \"folks.\" In this respect he bears likeness to the  English sparrow; but let it be remembered that there the analogy stops.  Even his chirruping is musical as he flies overhead, or makes his  _caveat_ from a tree or a telegraph wire against your ill-bred  espionage. He and his plainly clad little spouse build a neat cottage  for their bairns about the houses, but do not clog the spouting and make  themselves a nuisance otherwise, as is the habit of their English  cousins.    This finch is a minstrel, not of the first class, still one that merits  a high place among the minor songsters; and, withal, he is generous with  his music. You might call him a kind of urban Arion, for there is real  melody in his little score. As he is an early riser, his matin  voluntaries often mingled with my half-waking dreams in the morning at  dawn's peeping, and I loved to hear it too well to be angry for being  aroused at an unseasonable hour. The song is quite a complicated  performance at its best, considerably prolonged and varied, running up  and down the chromatic scale with a swing and gallop, and delivered  with great rapidity, as if the lyrist were in a hurry to have done, so  that he could get at something else.    In my rambles he was found not only in the cities of the plains (Denver,  Colorado Springs, and Pueblo), but also in many of the mountain towns  and villages visited, Leadville, over ten thousand feet skyward, being,  I believe, one of the exceptions, while Silver Plume and Graymont were  others. He does not fancy altitudes, I take it, much over eight thousand  feet.

For these purposes he  sent one of his assistants, Elias Morsianus, with a proper instrument,  under the protection of Bylovius, Ambassador of the Margrave of Anspach,  to the King of Denmark, who was returning by sea to Germany; and after  receiving the greatest attention and assistance from the noble Canons  of Ermeland, he determined, from nearly a month's observations on the  sun and stars, that the latitude of Frauenburg was 54 deg. 22-1/2', in place of  54 deg. 19-1/2', as given by Copernicus. In like manner he determined that the  latitude of Konigsberg was 54 deg. 43', in place of 54 deg. 17', as adopted by  Rheinhold. When Morsianus returned to Huen in July, he brought with him,  as a present to Tycho, from John Hannovius, one of the Canons of  Ermeland, the Ptolemaic Rules, or the Parallactic Instrument which  Copernicus had used and made with his own hands. It consisted of two  equal wooden rules, five cubits long, and divided into 1414 parts. Tycho  preserved this gift as one peculiarly dear to him, and, on the day of  his receiving it, he composed a set of verses in honour of the great  astronomer to whom it belonged.    Among the distinguished visits which were paid to Tycho, we must  enumerate that of Ulric, Duke of Mecklenburg, in 1586. Although his  daughter, Sophia, Queen of Denmark, had already paid two visits to  Uraniburg in the same year, yet such was her love of astronomy, that she  accompanied her father and his wife Elizabeth on this occasion. Ulric  was not only fond of science in general, but had for many years devoted  himself to chemical pursuits, and he was therefore peculiarly gratified  in examining the splendid laboratory and extensive apparatus which Tycho  possessed. It has been said by some of the biographers of Tycho, that  the Landgrave of Hesse visited Uraniburg about this period; but this  opinion is not correct, as it was only his astronomer and optician,  Rothman, who made a journey to Huen in 1591 for the recovery of his  health. Tycho had long carried on a correspondence with this able  astronomer respecting the observations made at the observatory of  Hesse-Cassel, and, during the few months which they now spent together,  they discussed in the amplest manner all the questions which had  previously been agitated. Rothman was astonished at the wonderful  apparatus which he saw at Uraniburg, and returned to his native country  charmed with the hospitality of the Danish astronomer.    Hitherto we have followed Tycho through a career of almost unexampled  prosperity. When he had scarcely reached his thirtieth year he was  established, by the kindness and liberality of his sovereign, in the  most splendid observatory that had ever been erected in Europe; and a  thriving family, an ample income, and a widely extended reputation were  added to his blessings. Of the value of these gifts he was deeply  sensible, and he enjoyed them the more that he received them with a  grateful heart. Tycho was a christian as well as a philosopher. The  powers of his gifted mind have been amply displayed in his astronomical  labours; but we shall now have occasion to witness his piety and  resignation in submitting to an unexpected and an adverse destiny.          CHAPTER III.           _Tycho's Labours do honour to his Country--Death of Frederick       II.--James VI. of Scotland visits Tycho at Uraniburg--Christian IV.       visits Tycho--The Duke of Brunswick's visit to Tycho--The Danish       Nobility, jealous of his fame, conspire against him--He is       compelled to quit Uraniburg--And to abandon his Studies--Cruelty of       the Minister Walchendorp--Tycho quits Denmark with his Family and       Instruments--Is hospitably received by Count Rantzau--Who       introduces him to the Emperor Rudolph--The Emperor invites him to       Prague--He gives him a Pension of 3000 Crowns--And the Castle of       Benach as a Residence and an Observatory--Kepler visits Tycho--Who       obtains for him the Appointment of Mathematician to Rudolph._      The love of astronomy which had been so unequivocally exhibited by  Frederick II. and his Royal Consort, inspired their courtiers with at  least an outward respect for science; and among the ministers and  advisers of the King, Tycho reckoned many ardent friends. It was every  where felt that Denmark had elevated herself among the nations of  Europe by her liberality to Tycho; and the peaceful glory which he had  in return conferred upon his country was not of a kind to dissatisfy  even rival nations. In the conquests of science no widow's or orphan's  tears are shed, no captives are dragged from their homes, and no devoted  victims are yoked to the chariot wheels of the triumphant philosopher.  The newly acquired domains of knowledge belong, in right of conquest, to  all nations, and Denmark had now earned the gratitude of Europe by the  magnitude as well as the success of her contingent.    An event, however, now occurred which threatened with destruction the  interests of Danish science. In the beginning of April 1588, Frederick  II. died in the 54th year of his age, and the 29th of his reign. His  remains were conveyed to Rothschild, and deposited in the chapel under  Tycho's care, where a finely executed bust of him was afterwards placed.  His son and successor, Christian IV., was only in the 11th year of his  age, and though his temper and disposition were good, yet Tycho had  reason to be alarmed at the possibility of his discontinuing the  patronage of astronomy. The taste for science, however, which had  sprung up in the Danish Court had extended itself no wider than the  influence of the reigning sovereign. The parasites of royalty saw  themselves eclipsed in the bright renown which Tycho had acquired, and  every new visit to Uraniburg by a foreign prince supplied fresh fuel to  the rancour which had long been smothering in their breasts. The  accession of a youthful king held out to his enemies an opportunity of  destroying the influence of Tycho; and though no adverse step was taken,  yet he had the sagacity to foresee, in \"trifles light as air,\" the  approaching confirmation of his fears. Hope, however, still cheered him  amid his labours, but that hope was founded chiefly on the learning and  character of Nicolas Caasius, the Chancellor of the Kingdom, from whom  he had experienced the warmest attentions.    Among the princes who visited Uraniburg, there were none who conducted  themselves with more condescension and generosity than our own  sovereign, James VI. In the year 1590, when the Scottish King repaired  to Denmark to celebrate his marriage with the Princess Anne, the King's  sister, he paid a visit to Tycho, attended by his councillors and a  large suite of nobility. During the eight days which he spent at  Uraniburg, James carried on long discussions with Tycho on various  subjects, but chiefly on the motion which Copernicus had ascribed to the  earth. He examined narrowly all the astronomical instruments, and made  himself acquainted with the principles of their construction and the  method of using them. He inspected the busts and pictures in the museum,  and when he perceived the portrait of George Buchanan, his own  preceptor, he could not refrain from the strongest expressions of  delight. Upon quitting the hospitable roof of Tycho, James not only  presented him with a magnificent donation, but afterwards gave him his  royal license to publish his works in England during seventy years. This  license was accompanied with the following high eulogium on his  abilities and learning:--\"Nor have I become acquainted with these things  only from the relation of others, or from a bare inspection of your  works, but I have seen then before my own eyes, and have heard them with  my own ears, in your residence at Uraniburg, and have drawn them from  the various learned and agreeable conversations which I there held with  you, and which even now affect my mind to such a degree, that it is  difficult to determine whether I recollect them with greater pleasure or  admiration; as I now willingly testify, by this license, to present and  to future generations,\" &c.    At the request of Tycho, the King also composed and wrote in his own  hand some Latin verses, which were more complimentary than classical.  His Chancellor had also composed some verses of a similar character  during his visit to Tycho. A short specimen of these will be deemed  sufficient by the classical reader:--        \"Vidit et obstupuit Rex Huennum Scoticus almam;      Miratus clari tot monumenta viri.\"    In the year 1591, when Christian IV. had reached his 14th year, he  expressed a desire to pay a visit to Uraniburg. He accordingly set out  with a large party, consisting of his three principal senators, and  other councillors and noblemen; and having examined the various  instruments in the observatories and laboratory, he proposed to Tycho  various questions on mechanics and mathematics, but particularly on the  principles of fortification and ship building. Having observed that he  particularly admired a brass globe, which, by means of internal  wheelwork, imitated the diurnal motion of the heavens, the rising and  setting of the sun, and the phases of the moon, Tycho made him a present  of it, and received in return an elegant gold chain, with his Majesty's  picture, with an assurance of his unalterable attachment and protection.    Notwithstanding this assurance, Tycho had already, as we have stated,  begun to suspect the designs of his enemies; and in a letter addressed  to the Landgrave of Hesse, early in 1591, he throws out some hints which  indicated the anxieties that agitated his mind. The Landgrave of Hesse,  as if he had heard some rumours unfavourable to the prospects of Tycho,  requested him to"]]]
