Therefore, the first object my eyes sought was this hill.      I could not believe my eyes! Literally speaking, I for a moment      thought the famous hill removed, and a little heap put in its      stead; for I had seen in New Brunswick a single rock, or hill of      solid rock, ten times as big, and four or five times as high! The      post-boy, going down hill, and not a bad road, whisked me in a few      minutes to the Bush Inn, from the garden of which I could see the      prodigious sand hill where I had begun my gardening works. What a      nothing! But now came rushing into my mind all at once my pretty      little garden, my little blue smock-frock, my little nailed shoes,      my pretty pigeons that I used to feed out of my hands, the last      kind words and tears of my gentle and tender-hearted and      affectionate mother. I hastened back into the room. If I had      looked a moment longer, I should have dropped. When I came to      reflect, what a change! What scenes I had gone through! How      altered my state! I had dined the day before at a secretary of      state's, in company with Mr. Pitt, and had been waited upon by men      in gaudy liveries! I had had nobody to assist me in the world. No      teachers of any sort. Nobody to shelter me from the consequence of      bad, and nobody to counsel me to good behaviour. I felt proud. The      distinctions of rank, birth, and wealth, all became nothing in my      eyes; and from that moment (less than a month after my arrival in      England), I resolved never to bend before them.\"    Cobbett was, for a short time, a labourer in the kitchen grounds of the  Royal Gardens at Kew. King George the Third often visited the gardens  to inquire after the fruits and esculents; and one day, he saw here  Cobbett, then a lad, who with a few halfpence in his pocket, and Swift's  _Tale of a Tub_ in his hand, had been so captivated by the wonders of  the royal gardens, that he applied there for employment. The king, on  perceiving the clownish boy, with his stockings tied about his legs by  scarlet garters, inquired about him, and specially desired that he might  be continued in his service.           *       *       *       *       *      COLERIDGE AN UNITARIAN PREACHER.    During his residence at Nether Stoney, Coleridge officiated as Unitarian  preacher at Taunton, and afterwards at Shrewsbury. Mr. Hazlitt has  described his walking ten miles on a winter day to hear Coleridge  preach. \"When I got there,\" he says, \"the organ was playing the 100th  psalm, and, when it was done, Mr. Coleridge rose and gave out his  text:--'He departed again into a mountain himself alone.' As he gave out  his text, his voice rose like a stream of rich distilled perfume; when  he came to the two last words, which he pronounced loud, deep, and  distinct, it seemed to me, who was then young, as if the sounds had  echoed from the bottom of the human heart, and as if that prayer might  have floated in solemn silence through the universe. The idea of St.  John came into my mind, of one crying in the wilderness, who had his  loins girt about, and whose food was locusts and wild honey. The  preacher then launched into his subject, like an eagle dallying with  the wind. The sermon was upon peace and war--upon Church and State; not  their alliance, but their separation; on the spirit of the world and the  spirit of Christianity; not as the same, but as opposed to one another.  He talked of those who had inscribed the cross of Christ on banners  dripping with human gore! He made a poetical and pastoral excursion;  and, to show the fatal effects of war, drew a striking contrast between  the simple shepherd-boy driving his team a-field, or sitting under the  hawthorn, piping to his flock, as though he should never be old, and the  same poor country-lad crimped, kidnapped, brought into town, made drunk  at an alehouse, turned into a wretched drummer-boy, with his hair  sticking on end with powder and pomatum, a long cue at his back, and  tricked out in the finery of the profession of blood.     \"'Such were the notes our once-loved poet sung;'    and, for myself, I could not have been more delighted if I had heard the  music of the spheres.\"           *       *       *       *       *      FONTENELLE'S INSENSIBILITY.    Fontenelle, who lived till within one month of a century, was very  rarely known to laugh or cry, and even boasted of his insensibility. One  day, a certain _bon-vivant_ Abbe came unexpectedly to dine with him. The  Abbe was fond of asparagus dressed with butter; Fontenelle, also, had a  great _gout_ for the vegetable, but preferred it dressed with oil.  Fontenelle said, that, for such a friend, there was no sacrifice he  would not make; and that he should have half the dish of asparagus  which he had ordered for himself, and that half, moreover, should be  dressed with butter. While they were conversing together, the poor  Abbe fell down in a fit of apoplexy; upon which Fontenelle instantly  scampered down stairs, and eagerly bawled out to his cook, \"The whole  with oil! the whole with oil, as at first!\"           *       *       *       *       *      PAINS AND TOILS OF AUTHORSHIP.    The craft of authorship is by no means so easy of practice as is  generally imagined by the thousands who aspire to its practice. Almost  all our works, whether of knowledge or of fancy, have been the product  of much intellectual exertion and study; or, as it is better expressed  by the poet--     \"the well-ripened fruits of wise decay.\"    Pope published nothing until it had been a year or two before him, and  even then his printer's proofs were very full of alterations; and, on  one occasion, Dodsley, his publisher, thought it better to have the  whole recomposed than make the necessary corrections. Goldsmith  considered four lines a day good work, and was seven years in beating  out the pure gold of the _Deserted Village_. Hume wrote his _History of  England_ on a sofa, but he went quietly on correcting every edition till  his death. Robertson used to write out his sentences on small slips of  paper; and, after rounding them and polishing them to his satisfaction,  he entered them in a book, which, in its turn, underwent considerable  revision. Burke had all his principal works printed two or three times  at a private press before submitting them to his publisher. Akenside and  Gray were indefatigable correctors, labouring every line; and so was our  prolix and more imaginative poet, Thomson. On comparing the first and  latest editions of the _Seasons_, there will be found scarcely a page  which does not bear evidence of his taste and industry. Johnson thinks  the poems lost much of their raciness under this severe regimen, but  they were much improved in fancy and delicacy; the episode of Musidora,  \"the solemnly ridiculous bathing scene,\" as Campbell terms it, was  almost entirely rewritten. Johnson and Gibbon were the least laborious  in arranging their _copy_ for the press. Gibbon sent the first and only  MS. of his stupendous work (the _Decline and Fall_) to his printer; and  Johnson's high-sounding sentences were written almost without an effort.  Both, however, lived and moved, as it were, in the world of letters,  thinking or caring of little else--one in the heart of busy London,  which he dearly loved, and the other in his silent retreat at Lausanne.  Dryden wrote hurriedly, to provide for the day; but his _Absalom and  Achitophel_, and the beautiful imagery of the _Hind and Panther_, must  have been fostered with parental care. St. Pierre copied his _Paul and  Virginia_ nine times, that he might render it the more perfect. Rousseau  was a very coxcomb in these matters: the amatory epistles, in his new  _Heloise_, he wrote on fine gilt-edged card-paper, and having folded,  addressed, and sealed them, he opened and read them in the solitary  woods of Clairens, with the mingled enthusiasm of an author and lover.  Sheridan watched long and anxiously for bright thoughts, as the MS. of  his _School for Scandal_, in its various stages, proves. Burns composed  in the open air, the sunnier the better; but he laboured hard, and with  almost unerring taste and judgment, in correcting.[10]    Lord Byron was a rapid composer, but made abundant use of the  pruning-knife. On returning one of his proof sheets from Italy, he  expressed himself undecided about a single word, for which he wished to  substitute another, and requested Mr. Murray to refer it to Mr. Gifford,  then editor of the _Quarterly Review_. Sir Walter Scott evinced his love  of literary labour by undertaking the revision of the whole of the  _Waverley_ Novels--a goodly freightage of some fifty or sixty volumes.  The works of Wordsworth, Southey, Coleridge, and Moore, and the occasional  variations in their different editions, mark their love of the touching.  Southey was, indeed, unwearied after his kind--a true author of the old  school. The bright thoughts of Campbell, which sparkle like polished  lances, were manufactured with almost equal care; he was the Pope of our  contemporary authors.[11] Allan Cunningham corrected but little, yet his  imitations of the elder lyrics are perfect centos of Scottish feeling  and poesy. The loving, laborious lingering of Tennyson over his poems,  and the frequent alterations--not in every case improvements--that  appear in successive editions of his works, are familiar to all his  admirers.     [10] \"I have seen,\" says a Correspondent of the _Inverness Courier_, \"a   copy of the second edition of Burns's 'Poems,' with the blanks filled   up, and numerous alterations made in the poet's handwriting: one   instance, not the most delicate, but perhaps the most amusing and   characteristic will suffice.

The heavy woods and swamps of this secluded route along these  forest shadowed streams are apparently very much as they were three  hundred years ago.    The water in all these streams, particularly in their upper parts, owing  to the sandy soil, is very clean and clear and is often stained by  the cedar roots in the swamps a clear brown, sometimes almost an amber  color. One of the streams, the Rancocas, with its many windings to Mount  Holly and then far inland to Brown's Mills, seems to be the favorite  with canoemen and is probably without an equal in its way for those who  love the Indian's gift that brings us so close to nature.    The spread of the Quaker settlements along Delaware Bay to Cape May  was checked by the Maurice River and its marshes and by the Great Cedar  Swamp which crossed the country from Delaware Bay to the ocean and thus  made of the Cape May region a sort of island. The Cape May region, it  is true, was settled by Quakers, but most of them came from Long Island  rather than from the settlements on the Delaware. They had followed  whale fishing on Long Island and in pursuit of that occupation some of  them had migrated to Cape May where whales were numerous not far off  shore.    The leading early families of Cape May, the Townsends, Stillwells,  Corsons, Leamings, Ludlams, Spicers, and Cresses, many of whose  descendants still live there, were Quakers of the Long Island strain.  The ancestor of the Townsend family came to Cape May because he had  been imprisoned and fined and threatened with worse under the New York  government for assisting his fellow Quakers to hold meetings. Probably  the occasional severity of the administration of the New York laws  against Quakers, which were the same as those of England, had as much  to do as had the whales with the migration to Cape May. This Quaker  civilization extended from Cape May up as far as Great Egg Harbor where  the Great Cedar Swamp joined the seashore. Quaker meeting houses were  built at Cape May, Galloway, Tuckahoe, and Great Egg. All have been  abandoned and the buildings themselves have disappeared, except that of  the Cape May meeting, called the Old Cedar Meeting, at Seaville; and it  has no congregation. The building is kept in repair by members of the  Society from other places.    Besides the Quakers, Cape May included a number of New Haven people, the  first of whom came there as early as 1640 under the leadership of George  Lamberton and Captain Turner, seeking profit in whale fishing. They were  not driven out by the Dutch and Swedes, as happened to their companions  who attempted to settle higher up the river at Salem and the Schuylkill.  About one-fifth of the old family names of Cape May and New Haven are  similar, and there is supposed to be not a little New England blood  not only in Cape May but in the neighboring counties of Cumberland and  Salem. While the first New Haven whalers came to Cape May in 1640, it is  probable that for a long time they only sheltered their vessels there,  and none of them became permanent settlers until about 1685.    Scandinavians contributed another element to the population of the Cape  May region. Very little is definitely known about this settlement, but  the Swedish names in Cape May and Cumberland counties seem to indicate a  migration of Scandinavians from Wilmington and Tinicum.    Great Egg Harbor, which formed the northern part of the Cape May  settlement, was named from the immense numbers of wild fowl, swans,  ducks, and water birds that formerly nested there every summer and have  now been driven to Canada or beyond. Little Egg Harbor farther up the  coast was named for the same reason as well as Egg Island, of three  hundred acres in Delaware Bay, since then eaten away by the tide. The  people of the district had excellent living from the eggs as well as  from the plentiful fowl, fish, and oysters.    Some farming was done by the inhabitants of Cape May; and many cattle,  marked with brands but in a half wild state, were kept out on the  uninhabited beaches which have now become seaside summer cities. Some  of the cattle were still running wild on the beaches down to the time  of the Civil War. The settlers \"mined\" the valuable white cedar from the  swamps for shingles and boards, leaving great \"pool holes\" in the swamps  which even today sometimes trap the unwary sportsman. The women knitted  innumerable mittens and also made wampum or Indian money from the clam  and oyster shells, an important means of exchange in the Indian trade  all over the colonies, and even to some extent among the colonists  themselves. The Cape May people built sloops for carrying the white  cedar, the mittens, oysters, and wampum to the outside world. They  sold a great deal of their cedar in Long Island, Rhode Island, and  Connecticut. Philadelphia finally became their market for oysters and  also for lumber, corn, and the whalebone and oil. Their sloops also  traded to the southern colonies and even to the West Indies.    They were an interesting little community, these Cape May people, very  isolated and dependent on the water and on their boats, for they were  completely cut off by the Great Cedar Swamp which stretched across the  point and separated them from the rest of the coast. This troublesome  swamp was not bridged for many years; and even then the roads to it were  long, slow, and too sandy for transporting anything of much bulk.    Next above Cape May on the coast was another isolated patch of  civilization which, while not an island, was nevertheless cut off on the  south by Great Egg Harbor with its river and marshes, and on the north  by Little Egg Harbor with the Mullica River and its marshes extending  far inland. The people in this district also lived somewhat to  themselves. To the north lay the district which extended to Sandy Hook,  also with its distinct set of people.    The people of the Cape became in colonial times clever traders in  various pursuits. Although in one sense they were as isolated as  islanders, their adventurous life on the sea gave them breadth of view.  By their thrift and in innumerable shrewd and persistent ways they  amassed competencies and estates for their families. Aaron Leaming, for  example, who died in 1780, left an estate of nearly $1,000,000. Some  kept diaries which have become historically valuable in showing not only  their history but their good education and the peculiar cast of their  mind for keen trading as well as their rigid economy and integrity.    One character, Jacob Spicer, a prosperous colonial, insisted on having  everything made at home by his sons and daughters--shoes, clothes,  leather breeches, wampum, even shoe thread--calculating the cost of  everything to a fraction and economizing to the last penny of money and  the last second of time. Yet in the course of a year he used \"fifty-two  gallons of rum, ten of wine, and two barrels of cyder.\" Apparently in  those days hard labor and hard drinking went well together.    The Cape May people, relying almost entirely on the water for  communication and trade, soon took to piloting vessels in the Delaware  River, and some of them still follow this occupation. They also became  skillful sailors and builders of small craft, and it is not surprising  to learn that Jacocks Swain and his sons introduced, in 1811, the  centerboard for keeping flat-bottomed craft closer to the wind. They  are said to have taken out a patent for this invention and are given the  credit of being the originators of the idea. But the device was known in  England in 1774, was introduced in Massachusetts in the same year, and  may have been used long before by the Dutch. The need of it, however,  was no doubt strongly impressed upon the Cape May people by the  difficulties which their little sloops experienced in beating home  against contrary winds. Some of them, indeed, spent weeks in sight of  the Cape, unable to make it. One sloop, the Nancy, seventy-two days from  Demarara, hung off and on for forty-three days from December 25, 1787,  to February 6, 1788, and was driven off fifteen times before she finally  got into Hereford Inlet. Sometimes better sailing craft had to go out  and bring in such distressed vessels. The early boats were no doubt  badly constructed; but in the end apprenticeship to dire necessity made  the Cape May sailors masters of seamanship and the windward art. *          * Stevens, \"History of Cape May County,\" pp. 219, 229; Kelley,  \"American Yachts\" (1884), p. 165.      Wilson, the naturalist, spent a great deal of time in the Cape May  region, because of the great variety of birds to be found there.  Southern types, like the Florida egret, ventured even so far north, and  it was a stopping place for migrating birds, notably woodcock, on their  northern and southern journeys. Men of the stone age had once been  numerous in this region, as the remains of village plats and great shell  heaps bore witness. It was a resting point for all forms of life. That  much traveled, adventurous gentleman of the sea, Captain Kidd, according  to popular legend, was a frequent visitor to this coast.    In later times, beginning in 1801, the Cape became one of the earliest  of the summer resorts. The famous Commodore Decatur was among the first  distinguished men to be attracted by the simple seaside charm of the  place, long before it was destroyed by wealth and crowds. Year by year  he used to measure and record at one spot the encroachment of the sea  upon the beach. Where today the sea washes and the steel pier extends,  once lay cornfields. For a hundred years it was a favorite resting place  for statesmen and politicians of national eminence. They traveled there  by stage, sailing sloop, or their own wagons. People"]]]
