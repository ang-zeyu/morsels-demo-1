Governor Robe.#--In 1841 Governor Grey had been of the greatest  service to the colony in changing the state of its prospects, but he was  not permitted to see more than the commencement of its great prosperity;  for, in 1845, he was sent to govern New Zealand, where troubles had  arisen similar to those which he had helped to cure in South Australia.  His place was filled by Colonel Robe, a military gentleman, of what is  called the old school, honourable and upright, but inclined to think  that everything ought always to be as it has been. He disliked all  innovation, and did what he could to prevent it, much to the discontent  of the young and thriving colony, which was of necessity the scene of  constant and rapid changes. He passed a very troublous time for three  years, and in 1848 was heartily glad to be recalled.      #6. Governor Young.#--The colony was then placed under the care of Sir  Henry Young, whose policy was completely the reverse. He sought by every  means in his power to encourage the ceaseless activity of the people.  His failing was, perhaps, an injudicious zeal for progress. For  instance, in his desire to open up the river Murray to navigation, he  wasted large sums of money in schemes that proved altogether useless. He  made an effort to remove the bar at the mouth of the river, but fresh  deposits of sand were constantly being brought down by the current, and  lashed up into a new bar by the waves that rolled ceaselessly in from  the Southern Ocean. He spent about L20,000 in trying to construct a  harbour called Port Elliot, near the entrance to the Murray; but there  are now only a few surf-beaten stones to indicate the scene of his  fruitless attempt. He offered a bonus of L4,000 to the first person who  should ascend the Murray in an iron steamer as far as the river Darling.  A gentleman called Cadell made the effort, and succeeded; he obtained  the reward, but it was not enough to pay his heavy expenses, and when he  endeavoured afterwards to carry on a trade, by transporting wool to the  sea in flat-bottomed steamers, he found that the traffic on the river  was not sufficiently great to repay his heavy outlay, and in a short  time he was almost ruined. The attempt was premature; and though, in our  time, the navigation of the Murray is successfully carried on, and is,  undoubtedly, of immense advantage not only to South Australia, but also  to New South Wales and Victoria, yet, at the time when the first efforts  were made, it led to nothing but loss, if not ruin to the pioneers.          CHAPTER XII.    THE DISCOVERY OF GOLD.      #1. Importance of the Year 1851.#--The year 1851 was in many ways an  eventful one to Australia. In that year the colonies received from  the Imperial Parliament the amended Constitutions they had so long  expected. Tasmania, South Australia, Port Phillip, and Western Australia  were now no longer under the absolute control of Governors sent out by  the colonial authorities in England; they could henceforth boast the  dignity of being self-governed communities, for, in 1851, they were  invested with political powers which had previously been possessed by  New South Wales alone. They now had the privilege of electing two-thirds  of the members of a Legislative Council which not only had the power of  making laws each for its own colony, but also of framing any new  constitution for itself according to its own taste and requirements.  Each colony kept its Legislative Council for only a year or two until it  could discuss and establish a regular system of parliamentary government  with two Houses and a Cabinet of responsible Ministers. Again, it was on  the 1st of July in the same year that Port Phillip gained its  independence; from that date onward its prosperous career must be  related under its new title--Victoria.    But the event which made the year 1851 especially memorable in the  annals of Australia was the discovery, near Bathurst, of the first of  those rich goldfields which, for so long a time, changed the prospects  of the colonies. For several years after the date of this occurrence the  history of Australia is little more than the story of the feverish  search for gold, with its hopes, its labour, its turmoil, and its  madness; its scenes of exultation and splendid triumph, and its still  more frequent scenes of bitter and gloomy disappointment.      #2. Early Rumours of Gold.#--For many years there had been rumours that  the Blue Mountains were auriferous. It was said that gold had been seen  by convicts in the days of Macquarie, and, indeed, still earlier; but to  the stories of prisoners, who claimed rewards for alleged discoveries,  the authorities in Sydney always listened with extreme suspicion, more  especially as no pretended discoverer could ever find more than his  first small specimens.    In 1840 a Polish nobleman named Strzelecki, who had been travelling  among the ranges round Mount Kosciusko, stated that, from indications he  had observed, he was firmly persuaded of the existence of gold in these  mountains; but the Governor asked him, as a favour, to make no mention  of a theory which might, perhaps, unsettle the colony, and fill the  easily excited convicts with hopes which, he feared, would prove  delusive. Strzelecki agreed not to publish his belief; but there was  another man of science who was not so easily to be silenced. The Rev. W.  B. Clarke, a clergyman devoted to geology, exhibited specimens in  Sydney, on which he based an opinion that the Blue Mountains would,  eventually, be found to possess goldfields of great extent and value.  Some of these were taken to London by Strzelecki; and in 1844 a great  English scientist, Sir Roderick Murchison, read a paper before the Royal  Geographical Society in which he expressed a theory similar to that of  Mr. Clarke. In 1846 he again called attention to this subject, and  showed that, from the great similarity which existed between the rocks  of the Blue Mountains and those of the Urals, there was every  probability that the one would be found as rich as the other was known  to be in the precious metals. So far as theory could go, the matter had  been well discussed before the year 1851, but no one had ventured to  spend his time and money in making a practical effort to settle the  question.      [Illustration: EDWARD HARGRAVES.]    #3. Edward Hargraves.#--About that, time, however, the rich mines of  California attracted a Bathurst settler, named Edward Hargraves, to seek  his fortune on the banks of the Sacramento; and though, among the great  crowds of struggling and jostling diggers, he met with but little  success, yet he learned the methods by which gold is discovered and  secured, and laid the foundation for adventures in Australia which were  afterwards to bring him both wealth and renown. Whilst he toiled with  increasing disappointment on one of these famous goldfields, the scenery  around him, and the appearance of the rocks, recalled to his memory a  certain secluded valley beyond the Blue Mountains, which he had visited  thirteen years before; the notion floated vaguely through his mind that,  perhaps, in that silent spot, there might lie great treasures, such as  he saw his more fortunate companions from time to time draw forth from  the rocks and soil around him. Day after day the image of that winding  creek among the hills near Bathurst recurred with increasing vividness  to stimulate his imagination and awaken his hopes. At length this  feeling impelled him to seek once more the shores of Australia in order  to examine the spot which had so often been present to his day-dreams.  He lost no time in sailing, and scarcely had he arrived in Sydney ere  he set out on horseback to cross the Blue Mountains. On the 11th of  February, 1851, he spent the night at a little inn a few miles from the  object of his journey, and shortly after dawn he sallied forth on his  ride through the forest, carrying with him a spade and a trowel and a  little tin dish. In the cool air of the morning the scent of the  spreading gum trees braced up his frame as he plunged deeper and deeper  among those lonely hollows and wood-clad hills. In an hour or two he  reached the well-remembered spot--the dry course of a mountain torrent  which, in rainy seasons, finds its way into the Summerhill Creek. He  lost no time in placing a little of the grey-coloured soil into his tin  dish, and at once carried it to the nearest pool, where he dipped the  whole beneath the water. By moving the dish rapidly, as he had learned  to do in California, he washed away the sand and earth; but the  particles of gold, which are more than seven and a half times heavier  than sand, were not so easily to be carried off. They sank to the corner  of the dish, where they lay secure--a few small specks, themselves of  little value, yet telling of hidden treasures that lay scattered in all  the soil around.    A few days were spent in a careful examination of the neighbouring  valleys, and when he was absolutely certain that the hopes he had so  warmly indulged would not prove empty, he set out for Sydney, taking  care, however, to breathe no word of what he thought or of what he had  proved. On the 3rd of April he wrote a letter to the Colonial Secretary,  in which he stated that, if the Government were willing to give him  L500, he would point out localities in New South Wales where gold was  abundantly to be found. In reply, the Colonial Secretary announced that  no preliminary reward could be given; but that, if he chose first of all  to point out the localities, he would afterwards be recompensed in  proportion to the results. He accepted these conditions; and Mr.  Stutchbury, the Colonial Geologist, was sent to accompany him to the  Summerhill "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25841"],[0,"Het Esperanto in Twintig
