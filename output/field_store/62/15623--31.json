He for whom it was made was Archibald  Bell-the-Cat, and he girded himself with it the day when, to justify his  name, he went to seize in the very tent of King James III, your  grandfather, his unworthy favourites, Cochran, Hummel, Leonard, and  Torpichen, whom he hanged on Louder Bridge with the halters of his  soldiers' horses. It was also with this sword that he slew at one blow,  in the lists, Spens of Kilspindie, who had insulted him in the presence  of King James IV, counting on the protection his master accorded him,  and which did not guard him against it any more than his shield, which  it split in two. At his master's death, which took place two years after  the defeat of Flodden, on whose battlefield he left his two sons and two  hundred warriors of the name of Douglas, it passed into the hands of the  Earl of Angus, who drew it from the scabbard when he drove the Hamiltons  out of Edinburgh, and that so quickly and completely that the affair was  called the 'sweeping of the streets.' Finally, your father James V saw  it glisten in the fight of the bridge over the Tweed, when Buccleuch,  stirred up by him, wanted to snatch him from the guardianship of the  Douglases, and when eighty warriors of the name of Scott remained on the  battlefield.\"    \"But,\" said the queen, \"how is it that this weapon, after such exploits,  has not remained as a trophy in the Douglas family? No doubt the Earl of  Angus required a great occasion to decide him to renounce in your favour  this modern Excalibur\". [History of Scotland, by Sir Walter Scott.--\"The  Abbott\": historical part.]    \"Yes, no doubt, madam, it was upon a great occasion,\" replied Lindsay,  in spite of the imploring signs made by Melville, \"and this will have at  least the advantage of the others, in being sufficiently recent for you  to remember. It was ten days ago, on the battlefield of Carberry Hill,  madam, when the infamous Bothwell had the audacity to make a public  challenge in which he defied to single combat whomsoever would dare to  maintain that he was not innocent of the murder of the king your  husband. I made him answer then, I the third, that he was an assassin.  And as he refused to fight with the two others under the pretext that  they were only barons, I presented myself in my turn, I who am earl and  lord. It was on that occasion that the noble Earl of Morton gave me this  good sword to fight him to the death. So that, if he had been a little  more presumptuous or a little less cowardly, dogs and vultures would be  eating at this moment the pieces that, with the help of this good sword,  I should have carved for them from that traitor's carcass.\"    At these words, Mary Seyton and Robert Melville looked at each other in  terror, for the events that they recalled were so recent that they were,  so to speak, still living in the queen's heart; but the queen, with  incredible impassibility and a smile of contempt on her lips--    \"It is easy, my lord,\" said she, \"to vanquish an enemy who does not  appear in the lists; however, believe me, if Mary had inherited the  Stuarts' sword as she has inherited their sceptre, your sword, long as  it is, would yet have seemed to you too short. But as you have only to  relate to us now, my lord, what you intended doing, and not what you  have done, think it fit that I bring you back to something of more  reality; for I do not suppose you have given yourself the trouble to  come here purely and simply to add a chapter to the little treatise Des  Rodomontades Espagnolles by M. de Brantome.\"    \"You are right, madam,\" replied Lindsay, reddening with anger, \"and you  would already know the object of our mission if Lord Ruthven did not so  ridiculously keep us waiting. But,\" added he, \"have patience; the matter  will not be long now, for here he is.\"    Indeed, at that moment they heard steps mounting the staircase and  approaching the room, and at the sound of these steps, the queen, who  had borne with such firmness Lindsay's insults, grew so perceptibly  paler, that Melville, who did not take his eyes off her,--put out his  hand towards the arm-chair as if to push it towards her; but the queen  made a sign that she had no need of it, and gazed at the door with  apparent calm. Lord Ruthven appeared; it was the first time that she had  seen the son since Rizzio had been assassinated by the father.    Lord Ruthven was both a warrior and a statesman, and at this moment his  dress savoured of the two professions: it consisted of a close coat of  embroidered buff leather, elegant enough to be worn as a court undress,  and on which, if need were, one could buckle a cuirass, for battle: like  his father, he was pale; like his father, he was to die young, and, even  more than his father, his countenance wore that ill-omened melancholy by  which fortune-tellers recognise those who are to die a violent death.    Lord Ruthven united in himself the polished dignity of a courtier and  the inflexible character of a minister; but quite resolved as he was to  obtain from Mary Stuart, even if it were by violence, what he had come  to demand in the regent's name, he none the less made her, on entering,  a cold but respectful greeting, to which the queen responded with a  courtesy; then the steward drew up to the empty arm-chair a heavy table  on which had been prepared everything necessary for writing, and at a  sign from the two lords he went out, leaving the queen and her companion  alone with the three ambassadors. Then the queen, seeing that this table  and this arm-chair were put ready for her, sat down; and after a moment,  herself breaking this silence more gloomy than any word could have  been--    \"My lords,\" said she, \"you see that I wait: can it be that this message  which you have to communicate to me is so terrible that two soldiers as  renowned as Lord Lindsay and Lord Ruthven hesitate at the moment of  transmitting it?\"    \"Madam,\" answered Ruthven, \"I am not of a family, as you know, which  ever hesitates to perform a duty, painful as it may be; besides, we hope  that your captivity has prepared you to hear what we have to tell you on  the part of the Secret Council.\"    \"The Secret Council!\" said the queen. \"Instituted by me, by what right  does it act without me? No matter, I am waiting for this message: I  suppose it is a petition to implore my mercy for the men who have dared  to reach to a power that I hold only from God.\"    \"Madam,\" replied Ruthven, who appeared to have undertaken the painful  role of spokesman, while Lindsay, mute and impatient, fidgeted with the  hilt of his long sword, \"it is distressing to me to have to undeceive  you on this point: it is not your mercy that I come to ask; it is, on  the contrary, the pardon of the Secret Council that I come to offer  you.\"    \"To me, my lord, to me!\" cried Mary: \"subjects offer pardon to their  queen! Oh! it is such a new and wonderful thing, that my amazement  outweighs my indignation, and that I beg you to continue, instead of  stopping you there, as perhaps I ought to do.\"    \"And I obey you so much the more willingly, madam,\" went on Ruthven  imperturbably, \"that this pardon is only granted on certain conditions,  stated in these documents, destined to re-establish the tranquillity of  the State, so cruelly compromised by the errors that they are going to  repair.\"    \"And shall I be permitted, my lord, to read these documents, or must I,  allured by my confidence in those who present them to me, sign them with  my eyes shut?\"    \"No, madam,\" Ruthven returned; \"the Secret Council desire, on the  contrary, that you acquaint yourself with them, for you must sign them  freely.\"    \"Read me these documents, my lord; for such a reading is, I think,  included in the strange duties you have accepted.\"    Lord Ruthven took one of the two papers that he had in his hand, and  read with the impassiveness of his usual voice the following:    \"Summoned from my tenderest youth to the government of the kingdom and  to the crown of Scotland, I have carefully attended to the  administration; but I have experienced so much fatigue and trouble that  I no longer find my mind free enough nor my strength great enough to  support the burden of affairs of State: accordingly, and as Divine  favour has granted us a son whom we desire to see during our lifetime  bear the crown which he has acquired by right of birth, we have resolved  to abdicate, and we abdicate in his favour, by these presents, freely  and voluntarily, all our rights to the crown and to the government of  Scotland, desiring that he may immediately ascend the throne, as if he  were called to it by our natural death, and not as the effect of our own  will; and that our present abdication may have a more complete and  solemn effect, and that no one should put forward the claim of  ignorance, we give full powers to our trusty and faithful cousins, the  lords Lindsay of Byres and William Ruthven, to appear in our name before  the nobility, the clergy, and the burgesses of Scotland, of whom they  will convoke an assembly at Stirling, and to there renounce, publicly  and solemnly, on our part, all our claims to the crown and to the  government of Scotland.    \"Signed freely and as the testimony of one of our last royal wishes, in  our castle of Lochleven, the ___ June 1567\". (The date was left blank.)    There was a moment's silence after this reading, then    \"Did you hear, madam?\" asked Ruthven.    \"Yes,\" replied Mary Stuart,--\"yes, I have heard rebellious words that I  have not understood, and I thought that my ears, that one has tried to  accustom for some time to a strange language, still deceived me, and  that I have thought for your honour, my lord William Ruthven, and my  lord Lindsay of Byres.\"    \"Madam,\" answered Lindsay, out of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2746"],[0,"Urbain Grandier (#20)"],[1,"to wait, he was  obliged to put up with those he had.    Thereupon the torture began. Pere Lactance having exorcised the  instruments, drove in the first wedge, but could not draw a murmur from  Grandier, who was reciting a prayer in a low voice; a second was driven  home, and this time the victim, despite his resolution, could not avoid  interrupting his devotions by two groans, at each of which Pere Lactance  struck harder, crying, \"Dicas! dicas!\" (Confess, confess!), a word which  he repeated so often and so furiously, till all was over, that he was  ever after popularly called \"Pere Dicas.\"    When the second wedge was in, de Laubardemont showed Grandier his  manuscript against the celibacy of the priests, and asked if he  acknowledged it to be in his own handwriting. Grandier answered in the  affirmative. Asked what motive he had in writing it, he said it was an  attempt to restore peace of mind to a poor girl whom he had loved, as  was proved by the two lines written at the end:        \"Si ton gentil esprit prend bien cette science,       Tu mettras en repos ta bonne conscience.\"         [If thy sensitive mind imbibe this teaching,       It will give ease to thy tender conscience]    Upon this, M. de Laubardemont demanded the girl's name; but Grandier  assured him it should never pass his lips, none knowing it but himself  and God. Thereupon M. de Laubardemont ordered Pere Lactance to insert  the third wedge. While it was being driven in by the monk's lusty arm,  each blow being accompanied by the word \"'Dicas'!\" Grandier exclaimed--    \"My God! they are killing me, and yet I am neither a sorcerer nor  sacrilegious!\"    At the fourth wedge Grandier fainted, muttering--    \"Oh, Pere Lactance, is this charity?\"    Although his victim was unconscious, Pere Lactance continued to strike;  so that, having lost consciousness through pain, pain soon brought him  back to life.    De Laubardemont took advantage of this revival to take his turn at  demanding a confession of his crimes; but Grandier said--    \"I have committed no crimes, sir, only errors. Being a man, I have often  gone astray; but I have confessed and done penance, and believe that my  prayers for pardon have been heard; but if not, I trust that God will  grant me pardon now, for the sake of my sufferings.\"    At the fifth wedge Grandier fainted once more, but they restored him to  consciousness by dashing cold water in his face, whereupon he moaned,  turning to M. de Laubardemont--    \"In pity, sir, put me to death at once! I am only a man, and I cannot  answer for myself that if you continue to torture me so I shall not give  way to despair.\"    \"Then sign this, and the torture shall cease,\" answered the commissioner  royal, offering him a paper.    \"My father,\" said Urbain, turning towards the Franciscan, \"can you  assure me on your conscience that it is permissible for a man, in order  to escape suffering, to confess a crime he has never committed?\"    \"No,\" replied the monk; \"for if he die with a lie on his lips he dies in  mortal sin.\"    \"Go on, then,\" said Grandier; \"for having suffered so much in my body, I  desire to save my soul.\"    As Pere Lactance drove in the sixth wedge Grandier fainted anew.    When he had been revived, Laubardemont called upon him to confess that a  certain Elisabeth Blanchard had been his mistress, as well as the girl  for whom he had written the treatise against celibacy; but Grandier  replied that not only had no improper relations ever existed between  them, but that the day he had been confronted with her at his trial was  the first time he had ever seen her.    At the seventh wedge Grandier's legs burst open, and the blood spurted  into Pere Lactance's face; but he wiped it away with the sleeve of his  gown.    \"O Lord my God, have mercy on me! I die!\" cried Grandier, and fainted  for the fourth time. Pere Lactance seized the opportunity to take a  short rest, and sat down.    When Grandier had once more come to himself, he began slowly to utter a  prayer, so beautiful and so moving that the provost's lieutenant wrote  it down; but de Laubardemont noticing this, forbade him ever to show it  to anyone.    At the eighth wedge the bones gave way, and the marrow oozed out of the  wounds, and it became useless to drive in any more wedges, the legs  being now as flat as the boards that compressed them, and moreover Pere  Lactance was quite worn out.    Grandier was unbound and laid upon the flagged floor, and while his eyes  shone with fever and agony he prayed again a second prayer--a veritable  martyr's prayer, overflowing with faith and enthusiasm; but as he ended  his strength failed, and he again became unconscious. The provost's  lieutenant forced a little wine between his lips, which brought him to;  then he made an act of contrition, renounced Satan and all his works  once again, and commended his soul to God.    Four men entered, his legs were freed from the boards, and the crushed  parts were found to be a mere inert mass, only attached to the knees by  the sinews. He was then carried to the council chamber, and laid on a  little straw before the fire.    In a corner of the fireplace an Augustinian monk was seated. Urbain  asked leave to confess to him, which de Laubardemont refused, holding  out the paper he desired to have signed once more, at which Grandier  said--    \"If I would not sign to spare myself before, am I likely to give way now  that only death remains?\"    \"True,\" replied Laubardemont; \"but the mode of your death is in our  hands: it rests with us to make it slow or quick, painless or agonising;  so take this paper and sign?\"    Grandier pushed the paper gently away, shaking his head in sign of  refusal, whereupon de Laubardemont left the room in a fury, and ordered  Peres Tranquille and Claude to be admitted, they being the confessors he  had chosen for Urbain. When they came near to fulfil their office,  Urbain recognised in them two of his torturers, so he said that, as it  was only four days since he had confessed to Pere Grillau, and he did  not believe he had committed any mortal sin since then, he would not  trouble them, upon which they cried out at him as a heretic and infidel,  but without any effect.    At four o'clock the executioner's assistants came to fetch him; he was  placed lying on a bier and carried out in that position. On the way he  met the criminal lieutenant of Orleans, who once more exhorted him to  confess his crimes openly; but Grandier replied--    \"Alas, sir, I have avowed them all; I have kept nothing back.\"    \"Do you desire me to have masses said for you?\" continued the  lieutenant.    \"I not only desire it, but I beg for it as a great favour,\" said Urbain.    A lighted torch was then placed in his hand: as the procession started  he pressed the torch to his lips; he looked on all whom he met with  modest confidence, and begged those whom he knew to intercede with God  for him. On the threshold of the door his sentence was read to him, and  he was then placed in a small cart and driven to the church of St.  Pierre in the market-place. There he was awaited by M. de Laubardemont,  who ordered him to alight. As he could not stand on his mangled limbs,  he was pushed out, and fell first on his knees and then on his face. In  this position he remained patiently waiting to be lifted. He was carried  to the top of the steps and laid down, while his sentence was read to  him once more, and just as it was finished, his confessor, who had not  been allowed to see him for four days, forced a way through the crowd  and threw himself into Grandier's arms. At first tears choked Pere  Grillau's voice, but at last he said, \"Remember, sir, that our Saviour  Jesus Christ ascended to His Father through the agony of the Cross: you  are a wise man, do not give way now and lose everything. I bring you  your mother's blessing; she and I never cease to pray that God may have  mercy on you and receive you into Paradise.\"    These words seemed to inspire Grandier with new strength; he lifted his  head, which pain had bowed, and raising his eyes to heaven, murmured a  short prayer. Then turning towards the worthy, friar, he said--    \"Be a son to my mother; pray to God for me constantly; ask all our good  friars to pray for my soul; my one consolation is that I die innocent. I  trust that God in His mercy may receive me into Paradise.\"    \"Is there nothing else I can do for you?\" asked Pere Grillau.    \"Alas, my father!\" replied Grandier, \"I am condemned to die a most cruel  death; ask the executioner if there is no way of shortening what I must  undergo.\"    \"I go at once,\" said the friar; and giving him absolution in 'articulo  mortis', he went down the steps, and while Grandier was making his  confession aloud the good monk drew the executioner aside and asked if  there were no possibility of alleviating the death-agony by means of a  shirt dipped in brimstone. The executioner answered that as the sentence  expressly stated that Grandier was to be burnt alive, he could not  employ an expedient so sure to be discovered as that; but that if the  friar would give him thirty crowns he would undertake to strangle  Grandier while he was kindling the pile. Pere Grillau gave him the  money, and the executioner provided himself with a rope. The Franciscan  then placed himself where he could speak to his penitent as he passed,  and as he embraced him for the last time, whispered to him what he had  arranged with the executioner, whereupon Grandier turned towards the  latter and said in a tone of deep gratitude--    \"Thanks, my brother.\"    At that moment, the archers having driven away Pere Grillau, by order of  M. de Laubardemont, by beating him with their halberts, the procession  resumed its march, to go through the same ceremony at the Ursuline  church, and from there to proceed to the square of Sainte-Croix.
