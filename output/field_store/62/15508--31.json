BOSTON:    ROBERTS BROTHERS.    1883.    [Illustration: QUI LEGIT REGIT]      UNIVERSITY PRESS: JOHN WILSON & SON,    CAMBRIDGE.      TO THE    REV. G. F. W. MORTIMER, D.D.,    _Prebendary of St. Paul's Cathedral, late Head Master of the City of  London School_.    DEAR DOCTOR MORTIMER,    We have other motives, beside the respect and gratitude which must be  felt for you by all those of your old pupils who are capable of  appreciating the work you did at the City of London School, for asking  you to let us dedicate to you a little book which we have entitled  \"English Lessons for English People.\"    Looking back upon our school life, we both feel that among the many  educational advantages which we enjoyed under your care, there was  none more important than the study of the works of Shakspeare, to  which we and our school-fellows were stimulated by the special prizes  of the Beaufoy Endowment.    We owe you a debt of gratitude not always owed by pupils to their  teachers. Many who have passed into a life of engrossing activity  without having been taught at school to use rightly, or to appreciate  the right use of, their native tongue, feeling themselves foreigners  amid the language of their country, may turn with some point against  their teachers the reproach of banished Bolingbroke:--                My tongue's use is to me no more      Than an unstringed viol or a harp,      Or like a cunning instrument cased up,      Or, being open, put into his hands      That knows no touch to tune the harmony;      Within my mouth you have engaoled my tongue,      Doubly portcullis'd with my teeth and lips,      And dull, unfeeling, barren ignorance      Is made my gaoler to attend on me.      I am too old to fawn upon a nurse,      Too far in years to be a pupil now.    It is our pleasant duty, on the contrary, to thank you for encouraging  us to study the \"cunning instrument\" of our native tongue.    Our sense of the benefits which we derived from this study, and our  recollection that the study was at that time optional, and did not  affect more than a small number of the pupils, lead us to anticipate  that when once the English language and literature become recognized,  not as an optional but as a regular part of our educational course,  the advantages will be so great as to constitute nothing short of a  national benefit.    The present seems to be a critical moment for English instruction. The  subject has excited much attention of late years; many schools have  already taken it up; others are on the point of doing so; it forms an  important part of most Government and other examinations. But there is  a complaint from many teachers that they cannot teach English for want  of text-books and manuals; and, as the study of English becomes year  by year more general, this complaint makes itself more and more  distinctly heard. To meet this want we have written the following  pages. If we had had more time, we might perhaps have been tempted to  aim at producing a more learned and exhaustive book on the subject;  but, setting aside want of leisure, we feel that a practical  text-book, and not a learned or exhaustive treatise, is what is wanted  at the present crisis.    We feel sure that you will give a kindly welcome to our little book,  as an attempt, however imperfect, to hand on the torch which you have  handed to us; we beg you also to accept it as a token of our sincere  gratitude for more than ordinary kindnesses, and to believe us      Your affectionate pupils,                     J. R. SEELEY.                   EDWIN A. ABBOTT.             *       *       *       *       *      _Messrs. Roberts Brothers' Publications._      ENGLISH LESSONS FOR ENGLISH PEOPLE. By Rev. E. A. ABBOTT, M.A., and  Prof. J. R. SEELEY, M.A. Part I.--Vocabulary. Part II--Diction. Part  III.--Metre. Part IV.--Hints on Selection and Arrangement. Appendix.  16mo. Price $1.50.    _From the London Athenaeum._         The object of this book is evidently a practical one. It is       intended for ordinary use by a large circle of readers; and       though designed principally for boys, may be read with advantage       by many of more advanced years. One of the lessons which it       professes to teach, \"to use the right word in the right place,\"       is one which no one should despise. The accomplishment is a rare       one, and many of the hints here given are truly admirable.    _From the Southern Review._         The study of Language can never be exhausted. Every time it is       looked at by a man of real ability and culture, some new phase       starts into view. The origin of Language; its relations to the       mind; its history; its laws; its development; its struggles; its       triumphs; its devices; its puzzles; its ethics,--every thing       about it is full of interest.         Here is a delightful book, by two men of recognized       authority,--the head Master of London School, and the Professor       of Modern History in the University of Cambridge, the notable       author of \"Ecce Homo.\" The book is so comprehensive in its scope       that it seems almost miscellaneous. It treats of the vocabulary       of the English Language; Diction as appropriate to this or that       sort of composition; selection and arguments of topics; Metre,       and an Appendix on Logic. All this in less than three hundred       pages. Within this space so many subjects cannot be treated       exhaustively; and no one is, unless we may except Metre, to which       about eighty pages are devoted, and about which all seems to be       said that is worth saying,--possibly more. But on each topic some       of the best things are said in a very stimulating way. The       student will desire to study more thoroughly the subject into       which such pleasant openings are here given; and the best       prepared teacher will be thankful for the number of striking       illustrations gathered up to his hand.         The abundance and freshness of the quotations makes the volume       very attractive reading, without reference to its didactic value.      _Sold by all booksellers. Mailed, postpaid, by the Publishers_,    ROBERTS BROTHERS, BOSTON.          PREFACE.      This book is not intended to supply the place of an English Grammar.  It presupposes a knowledge of Grammar and of English idiom in its  readers, and does not address itself to foreigners, but to those who,  having already a familiar knowledge of English, need help to write it  with taste and exactness. Some degree of knowledge is presumed in the  reader; nevertheless we do not presume that he possesses so much as to  render him incapable of profiting from _lessons_. Our object is, if  possible, not merely to interest, but to _teach_; to write lessons,  not essays,--lessons that may perhaps prove interesting to some who  have passed beyond the routine of school life, but still lessons, in  the strictest sense, adapted for school classes.    Aiming at practical utility, the book deals only with those  difficulties which, in the course of teaching, we have found to be  most common and most serious. For there are many difficulties, even  when grammatical accuracy has been attained, in the way of English  persons attempting to write and speak correctly. First, there is the  cramping restriction of an insufficient vocabulary; not merely a loose  and inexact"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22606"],[0,"The Booklover and His Books (#20)"],[1,"admire,       as I did in my youth, and as I now do with Sir Walter Scott.       I have now begun \"Rob Roy,\" and I shall read all his       romances in succession. All is great--material, import,       characters, execution; and then what infinite diligence in       the preparatory studies! what truth of detail in the       composition! Here we see what English history is; what an       inheritance to a poet able to make use of it. Walter Scott       is a great genius; he has not his equal; and we need not       wonder at the extraordinary effect he has produced on the       reading world. He gives me much to think of; and I discover       in him a wholly new art with laws of its own.    Of Goethe himself Carlyle confessed that the reading of his works made  him understand what the Methodists mean by a new birth. Those who are  familiar with the speeches and writings of Daniel Webster realize the  inspiration that he owed to the grandeur of Milton. His great rival,  Calhoun, honored everywhere as a statesman, was known in his own home as  \"the old man of the Bible.\" It was the reading of the Bible that  equipped John Bunyan to become the author of \"Pilgrim's Progress.\" The  novelists have not failed to recognize the influence of some single book  on a human life. It was the accidental possession of a folio volume of  Shakespeare--in Blackmore's \"Lorna Doone\"--that transformed John Ridd  from a hulking countryman to a man of profound acquaintance with the  world. And who does not remember Gabriel Betteridge, the simple-hearted  old steward in Wilkie Collins's \"Moonstone,\" who finds for every  occurrence a text to counsel or console in his favorite \"Robinson  Crusoe\"?    As the experience of Professor Torrey shows, different books appeal to  us most strongly at different ages. Young men read Shelley, old men  read Wordsworth. In youth \"Hamlet\" is to us the greatest of all plays;  in old age, \"Lear.\" I know of no more interesting account of the  development of a mind in the choice of books than that presented in John  Beattie Crozier's autobiographical volume entitled \"My Inner Life.\" The  author is an English philosopher, who was born and lived until manhood  in the backwoods of Canada. He tells us how as a young man groping about  for some clew to the mystery of the world in which he found himself, he  tried one great writer after another--Mill, Buckle, Carlyle,  Emerson--all to no purpose, for he was not ready for them. At this  period he read with great profit the \"Recreations of a Country Parson,\"  which, as he says, \"gave me precisely the grade and shade of platitude I  required.\" But more important were the weekly sermons of Henry Ward  Beecher. Of him Crozier says:         For years his printed sermons were the main source of my       instruction and delight. His range and variety of       observation ... his width of sympathy; his natural and       spontaneous pathos; the wealth of illustration and metaphor       with which his sermons were adorned, and which were drawn       chiefly from natural objects, from his orchard, his farm,       his garden, as well as from machinery and from all kinds of       natural processes; his naturalism and absence of theological       bias; his knowledge of average men and their ways of looking       at things; in a word, his general fertility of thought,       filling up, as it did, the full horizon of my mind, and       running over and beyond it on all sides, so that wherever I       looked he had been there before me--all this delighted and       enchanted me, and made him for some years my ideal of       intellectual greatness; and I looked forward to the       Saturdays on which his weekly sermons reached me with       longing and pure joy.    Later, in England, Crozier took up the works of the philosophers with  better success. The chapter of most interest for us is the one on the  group which he calls \"The Poetic Thinkers\"--Carlyle, Newman, Emerson,  Goethe. Of these he places Goethe and Emerson highest. Indeed of  Emerson's essay on \"Experience\" he says:         In this simple framework Emerson has contrived to work in       thoughts on human life more central and commanding, more       ultimate and final, and of more universal application than       are to be found within the same compass in the literature of       any age or time, thoughts which rise to the mind as       naturally and spontaneously when the deeper secrets of life       are in question, as proverbs do in its more obvious and       superficial aspects.... Nowhere, indeed, will you find       greater penetration and profundity, or greater refinement       and delicacy than in these essays (of Emerson).... After a       lapse of ten or fifteen years ... no increase of experience       or reflection has enabled me to add or suggest aught by way       of commentary on these great and penetrating observations on       human life that is not either more superficial or less       true.... Until Emerson is understood, no observer of human       life making any pretension to originality can, in my       judgment, consider his reputation safe, or his work free       from the danger of being undermined by this great master of       human thought.    If some scholar on whose judgment we relied were to speak in these terms  of a book that was only to be read in Persian or Icelandic, how  cheerfully we should bend ourselves to the task of learning these  difficult tongues for the sake of the reward--the possession of the  coveted thought. But the writings of Emerson are in our own language and  accessible in the cheapest editions. If to us personally Emerson does  not make this supreme appeal, there are other writers, all at hand, set  apart from the great multitude of lesser spirits by that final weigher  of human talents whom Bacon calls Good Fame. It is not that among the  myriad volumes of a library we must painfully and largely by accident  discover the few of highest worth--scanning each doubtfully as one  searches for an unknown visitor in the crowd alighting from a train. No,  the best books are the best known, the most accessible. Lists of the  ten, the fifty, the one hundred best books are at our disposal, and, if  they do not always represent final judgments, are near enough for  practical purposes. The will to read the best books is all that we need  to supply--the rest has been done for us. And is there anyone who turns  with indifference from the high and free privilege of making the  greatest spirits that have ever lived his bosom friends, his companions  and counselors? If there be such a one, would that I might repeat to him  more of that glorious chant in praise of books that has been sung by the  wise of all ages, from Socrates to Gladstone. I have given a few of  these tributes already; I will close with one from an unexpected source.  Says Walt Whitman, in his \"Democratic Vistas,\" speaking of the books  that have come down to us from antiquity:         A few immortal compositions, small in size, yet compassing       what measureless values of reminiscence, contemporary       portraitures, manners, idioms and beliefs, with deepest       inference, hint and thought, to tie and touch forever the       old, new body, and the old, new soul. These! and still       these! bearing the freight so dear--dearer than       pride--dearer than love. All the best experience of humanity       folded, saved, freighted to us here! Some of these tiny       ships we call Old and New Testament, Homer, Eschylus, Plato,       Juvenal, etc. Precious minims! I think if we were forced to       choose, rather than have you, and the likes of you, and what       belongs to and has grown of you, blotted out and gone, we       could better afford, appalling as that would be, to lose all       actual ships, this day fastened by wharf, or floating on       wave, and see them, with all their cargoes, scuttled and       sent to the bottom.         Gathered by geniuses of city, race or age, and put by them       in highest of art's forms, namely, the literary form, the       peculiar combinations, and the outshows of that city, age or       race, its particular modes of the universal attributes and       passions, its faiths, heroes, lovers and gods, wars,       traditions, struggles, crimes, emotions, joys (or the subtle       spirit of these) having been passed on to us to illumine our       own selfhood, and its experiences--what they supply,       indispensable and highest, if taken away, nothing else in       all the world's boundless storehouses could make up to us,       or ever again return.          PRINTING PROBLEMS FOR SCIENCE TO SOLVE      The book seems to have been regarded for hundreds of years--for  thousands of years if we include its prototypes--as a thing apart,  subject to its own laws of beauty, utility, and economy. But recently  men have come to realize that the book has no special esthetic license,  that what is barbarous art elsewhere is barbarous in the book; they also  recognize that the book is within the domain of economics, that the  invention of typography was primarily a reduction of cost, and that a  myriad later processes, which make the book what it is to-day, are all  developments of the same principle. What has not been so clearly seen is  that in the field of utility the book is not independent, cannot impose  conditions upon its users, but is an instrument strictly subordinate to  human needs. The establishment of its efficiency has only begun when we  have adapted it to the convenience of the hand and the bookshelf. The  real tests of its utility are subtle, not gross, and are, in fact,  beyond the range of ordinary haphazard experience. In this field popular  judgment may be right or wrong; it offers merely an opinion, which it  cannot prove. But here that higher power of common sense that we call  science comes in and gives verdicts that take account of all the"]]]
