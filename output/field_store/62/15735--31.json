[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34853"],[0,"The Fairy-Faith in Celtic Countries (#20)"],[1," and cousin and myself were  gathering bilberries (whortleberries) up by the rocks at the back of  here, when all at once we heard music. We hurried round the rocks, and  there we were within a few hundred feet of six or eight of the _gentle  folk_, and they dancing. When they saw us, a little woman dressed all in  red came running out from them towards us, and she struck my cousin  across the face with what seemed to be a green rush. We ran for home as  hard as we could, and when my cousin reached the house she fell dead.  Father saddled a horse and went for Father Ryan. When Father Ryan  arrived, he put a stole about his neck and began praying over my cousin  and reading psalms and striking her with the stole; and in that way  brought her back. He said if she had not caught hold of my brother, she  would have been _taken_ for ever.'    _The 'Gentle Folk'._--'The _gentle folk_ are not earthly people; they  are a people with a nature of their own. Even in the water there are men  and women of the same character. Others have caves in the rocks, and in  them rooms and apartments. These races were terribly plentiful a hundred  years ago, and they'll come back again. My father lived two miles from  here, where there were plenty of the _gentle folk_. In olden times they  used to take young folks and keep them and draw all the life out of  their bodies. Nobody could ever tell their nature exactly.'      EVIDENCE FROM COUNTY FERMANAGH    From James Summerville, eighty-eight years old, who lives in the country  near Irvinestown, I heard much about the 'wee people' and about  banshees, and then the following remarkable story concerning the 'good  people':--    _Travelling Clairvoyance through 'Fairy' Agency._--'From near Ederney,  County Fermanagh, about seventy years ago, a man whom I knew well was  taken to America on Hallow Eve Night; and _they_ (the _good people_)  made him look down a chimney to see his own daughter cooking at a  kitchen fire. Then _they_ took him to another place in America, where he  saw a friend he knew. The next morning he was at his own home here in  Ireland.    'This man wrote a letter to his daughter to know if she was at the place  and at the work on Hallow Eve Night, and she wrote back that she was. He  was sure that it was the _good people_ who had taken him to America and  back in one night.'      EVIDENCE FROM COUNTY ANTRIM    At the request of Major R. G. Berry, M.R.I.A., of Richill Castle,  Armagh, Mr. H. Higginson, of Glenavy, County Antrim, collected all the  material he could find concerning the fairy-tradition in his part of  County Antrim, and sent to me the results, from which I have selected  the very interesting, and, in some respects, unique tales which  follow:--    _The Fairies and the Weaver._--'Ned Judge, of Sophys Bridge, was a  weaver. Every night after he went to bed the weaving started of itself,  and when he arose in the morning he would find the dressing which had  been made ready for weaving so broken and entangled that it took him  hours to put it right. Yet with all this drawback he got no poorer,  because the fairies left him plenty of household necessaries, and  whenever he sold a web [of cloth] he always received treble the amount  bargained for.'    _Meeting Two Regiments of 'Them'._--'William Megarry, of Ballinderry, as  his daughter who is married to James Megarry, J.P., told me, was one  night going to Crumlin on horseback for a doctor, when after passing  through Glenavy he met just opposite the Vicarage two regiments of  _them_ (the fairies) coming along the road towards Glenavy. One regiment  was dressed in red and one in blue or green uniform. _They_ were playing  music, but when they opened out to let him pass through the middle of  _them_ the music ceased until he had passed by.'      IN CUCHULAINN'S COUNTRY: A CIVIL ENGINEER'S TESTIMONY    In the heroic days of pagan Ireland, as tradition tells, the ancient  earthworks, now called the Navan Rings, just outside Armagh, were the  stronghold of Cuchulainn and the Red Branch Knights; and, later, under  Patrick, Armagh itself, one of the old mystic centres of Erin, became  the ecclesiastical capital of the Gaels. And from this romantic country,  one of its best informed native sons, a graduate civil engineer of  Dublin University, offers the following important evidence:--    _The Fairies are the Dead._--'When I was a youngster near Armagh, I was  kept good by being told that the fairies could take bad boys away. The  sane belief about the fairies, however, is different, as I discovered  when I grew up. The old people in County Armagh seriously believe that  the fairies are the spirits of the dead; and they say that if you have  many friends deceased you have many friendly fairies, or if you have  many enemies deceased you have many fairies looking out to do you harm.'    _Food-Offerings to Place-Fairies._--'It was very usual formerly, and the  practice is not yet given up, to place a bed, some other furniture, and  plenty of food in a newly-constructed dwelling the night before the time  fixed for moving into it; and if the food is not consumed, and the  crumbs swept up by the door in the morning, the house cannot safely be  occupied. I know of two houses now that have never been occupied,  because the fairies did not show their willingness and goodwill by  taking food so offered to them.'      ON THE SLOPES OF SLIEVE GULLION    In climbing to the summit of Cuchulainn's mountain, which overlooks  parts of the territory made famous by the 'Cattle Raid of Cooley', I met  John O'Hare, sixty-eight years old, of Longfield Townland, leading his  horse to pasture, and I stopped to talk with him about the 'good  people'.    'The _good people_ in this mountain,' he said, 'are the people who have  died and been _taken_; the mountain is enchanted.'    _The 'Fairy' Overflowing of the Meal-Chest._--'An old woman came to the  wife of Steven Callaghan and told her not to let Steven cut a certain  hedge. \"It is where we shelter at night,\" the old woman added; and Mrs.  Callaghan recognized the old woman as one who had been _taken_ in  confinement. A few nights later the same old woman appeared to Mrs.  Callaghan and asked for charity; and she was offered some meal, which  she did not take. Then she asked for lodgings, but did not stop. When  Mrs. Callaghan saw the meal-chest next morning it was overflowing with  meal: it was the old woman's gift for the hedge.'      THE TESTIMONY OF TWO DROMINTEE PERCIPIENTS    After my friend, the Rev. Father L. Donnellan, C.C., of Dromintee,  County Armagh, had introduced me to Alice Cunningham, of his parish, and  she had told much about the 'gentle folk', she emphatically declared  that they do exist--and this in the presence of Father Donnellan--because  she has often seen them on Carrickbroad Mountain, near where she lives.  And she then reported as follows concerning enchanted Slieve Gullion:--    _The 'Sidhe' Guardian of Slieve Gullion._--'The top of Slieve Gullion is  a very _gentle_ place. A fairy has her house there by the lake, but she  is invisible. She interferes with nobody. I hear of no _gentler_ places  about here than Carrickbroad and Slieve Gullion.'    Father Donnellan and I called next upon Thomas McCrink and his wife at  Carrifamayan, because Mrs. McCrink claims to have seen some of the 'good  people', and this is her testimony:--    _Nature of the 'Good People'._--'I've heard and felt the _good people_  coming on the wind; and I once saw them down in the middle field on my  father's place playing football. They are still on earth. Among them are  the spirits of our ancestors; and these rejoice whenever good fortune  comes our way, for I saw them before my mother won her land [after a  long legal contest] in the field rejoicing.    'Some of the _good people_ I have thought were fallen angels, though  these may be dead people whose time is not up. We are only like shadows  in this world: my mother died in England, and she came to me in the  spirit. I saw her plainly. I ran to catch her, but my hands ran through  her form as if it were mere mist. Then there was a crack, and she was  gone.' And, finally, after a moment, our percipient said:--'The fairies  once passed down this lane here on a Christmas morning; and I took them  to be suffering souls out of Purgatory, going to mass.'      THE TESTIMONY OF A DROMINTEE SEERESS    Father Donnellan, the following day, took me to talk with almost the  oldest woman in his parish, Mrs. Biddy Grant, eighty-six years old, of  Upper Toughal, beside Slieve Gullion. Mrs. Grant is a fine specimen of  an Irishwoman, with white hair, clear complexion, and an expression of  great natural intelligence, though now somewhat feeble from age. Her  mind is yet clear, however; and her testimony is substantiated by this  statement from her own daughter, who lives with her:--'My mother has the  power of seeing things. It is a fact with her that spirits exist. She  has seen much, even in her old age; and what she is always telling me  scares me half to death.'    The following is Mrs. Grant's direct testimony given at her own home, on  September 20, 1909, in answer to our question if she knew anything about  the 'good people':--    _Seeing the 'Good People' as the Dead._--'I saw _them_ once as plain as  can be--big, little, old, and young. I was in bed at the time, and a boy  whom I had reared since he was born was lying ill beside me. Two of  _them_ came and looked at him; then came in three of _them_. One of  _them_ seemed to have something like a book, and he put his hand to the  boy's mouth; then he went away, while others appeared, opening the back  window to make an avenue through the house; and through this avenue came  great crowds. At this I shook the boy, and said to him, \"Do you see  anything?\" \"No,\" he said; but as I made him look a second time he said,  \"I do.\" After that he got well.    'These _good people_ were the spirits"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34856"],[0,"My Own Story (#20)"],[1,"y, my  daughter rose to conduct her first case at law. She had earned the right  to an LL.B. after her name, but as women are not permitted to practise  law in England, she had never appeared at the bar in any capacity except  that of defendant. Now she proposed to combine the two roles of  defendant and lawyer, and conduct the case for the three of us. She  began by asking the magistrate not to try the case in that court, but to  send it for trial before a judge and jury. We had long desired to take  the Suffragettes' cases before bodies of private citizens, because we  had every reason to suspect that the police-court officials acted under  the direct commands of the very persons against whom our agitation was  directed. Jury trial was denied us; but after the preliminary  examination was over the magistrate, Mr. Curtis Bennett, allowed a  week's adjournment for preparation of the case.    On October 21st the trial was resumed, with the courtroom as full as  before and the press table even more crowded, for it had been widely  published that we had actually subpoenaed two members of the  Government, who had witnessed the scenes on the night of October 13th.  The first witness to enter the box was Mr. Lloyd-George. Christabel  examined him at some length as to the meaning and merits of the word  rush, and succeeded in making him very uncomfortable--and the charge  against ourselves look very flimsy. She then questioned him about the  speeches he had heard at Trafalgar Square, and as to whether there had  been any suggestion that property be destroyed or personal violence  used. He admitted that the speeches were temperate and the crowds  orderly. Then Christabel suddenly asked, \"There were no words used so  likely to incite to violence as the advice you gave at Swansea, that the  women should be ruthlessly flung out of your meeting?\" Mr. Lloyd-George  looked black, and answered nothing. The magistrate hastened to the  protection of Mr. Lloyd-George. \"This is quite irrelevant,\" he said.  \"That was a private meeting.\" It was a public meeting, and Christabel  said so. \"It was a private meeting _in a sense_,\" insisted the  magistrate.    Mr. Lloyd-George assumed an air of pompous indignation when Christabel  asked him, \"Have we not received encouragement from you, and if not from  you from your colleagues, to take action of this kind?\" Mr. Lloyd-George  rolled his eyes upward as he replied, \"I should be very much surprised  to hear that, Miss Pankhurst.\"    \"Is it not a fact,\" asked Christabel, \"that you yourself have set us an  example of revolt?\" \"I never incited a crowd to violence,\" exclaimed  the witness. \"Not in the Welsh graveyard case?\" she asked. \"No!\" he  cried angrily. \"You did not tell them to break down a wall and disinter  a body?\" pursued Christabel. He could not deny this but, \"I gave advice  which was found by the Court of Appeal to be sound legal advice,\" he  snapped, and turned his back as far as he could in the narrow  witness-box.    Mr. Herbert Gladstone had asked to be allowed to testify early, as he  was being detained from important public duties. Christabel asked to  question one witness before Mr. Gladstone entered the box. The witness  was Miss Georgiana Brackenbury, who had recently suffered six weeks'  imprisonment for the cause, and had since met and had a talk with Mr.  Horace Smith, the magistrate, who had made to her a most important and  damaging admission of the government's interference in suffragists'  trials. Christabel asked her one question. \"Did Mr. Horace Smith tell  you in sentencing you that he was doing what he had been told to do?\"  \"You must not put that question!\" exclaimed the magistrate. But the  witness had already answered \"Yes.\" There was an excited stir in the  courtroom. It had been recorded under oath that a magistrate had  admitted that Suffragettes were being sentenced not by himself,  according to the evidence and according to law, but by the Government,  for no one could possibly doubt where Mr. Horace Smith's orders came  from.    Mr. Gladstone, plump, bald, and ruddy, in no way resembles his  illustrious father. He entered the witness-box smiling and confident,  but his complacence vanished when Christabel asked him outright if the  Government had not ordered the Commissioner of Police to take this  action against us. Of course the magistrate intervened, and Mr.  Gladstone did not answer the question. Christabel tried again. \"Did you  instruct Mr. Horace Smith to decide against Miss Brackenbury, and to  send her to prison for six weeks?\" That too was objected to, as were all  questions on the subject.    All through the examination the magistrate constantly intervened to save  the Cabinet Minister from embarrassment, but Christabel finally  succeeded in making Mr. Gladstone admit, point by point, that he had  said that women could never get the vote because they could not fight  for it as men had fought.    A large number of witnesses testified to the orderly nature of the  demonstration on the 13th, and then Christabel rose to plead. She began  by declaring that these proceedings had been taken, as the legal saying  is, \"in malice and vexation,\" in order to lame a political enemy. She  declared that, under the law, the charge which might properly be brought  against us was that of illegal assembly, but the Government had not  charged us with this offence, because the Government desired to keep the  case in a police court.    \"The authorities dare not see this case come before a jury,\" she  declared, \"because they know perfectly well that if it were heard before  a jury of our countrymen we should be acquitted, just as John Burns was  acquitted years ago for taking action far more dangerous to the public  peace than we have taken. We are deprived of trial by jury. We are also  deprived of the right to appeal against the magistrate's decision. Very  carefully has this procedure been thought out.\"    Of the handbill she said: \"We do not deny that we issued this bill; none  of us three has wished to deny responsibility. We did issue the bill; we  did cause it to be circulated; we did put upon it the words 'Come and  help the suffragettes rush the House of Commons.' For these words we do  not apologise. It is very well known that we took this action in order  to press forward a claim, which, according to the British constitution,  we are well entitled to make.\"    In all that the Suffragettes had done, in all that they might ever do,  declared my daughter, they would only be following in the footsteps of  men now in Parliament. \"Mr. Herbert Gladstone has told us in the speech  I read to him that the victory of argument alone is not enough. As we  cannot hope to win by force of argument alone, it is necessary to  overcome by other means the savage resistance of the Government to our  claim for citizenship. He says, 'Go on, fight as the men did.' And then,  when we show our power and get the people to help us, he takes  proceedings against us in a manner that would have been disgraceful even  in the old days of coercion. Then there is Mr. Lloyd-George, who, if any  man has done so, has set us an example. His whole career has been a  series of revolts. He has said that if we do not get the vote--mark  these words--we should be justified in adopting the methods the men had  to adopt, namely, pulling down the Hyde Park railings.\" She quoted Lord  Morley as saying of the Indian unrest: \"'We are in India in the presence  of a living movement, and a movement for what? For objects which we  ourselves have taught them to think are desirable objects; and unless we  can somehow reconcile order with satisfaction of those ideals and  aspirations, the fault will not be theirs, it will be ours--it will mark  the breakdown of British statesmanship.'--Apply those words to our  case,\" she continued.    [Illustration: CHRISTABEL, MRS. DRUMMOND AND MRS. PANKHURST IN THE DOCK,  FIRST CONSPIRACY TRIAL    _October, 1908_]    \"Remember that we are demanding of Liberal statesmen that which is for  us the greatest boon and the most essential right--and if the present  Government cannot reconcile order with our demand for the vote without  delay, it will mark the breakdown of their statesmanship. Yes, their  statesmanship has broken down already. They are disgraced. It is only in  this court that they have the smallest hope of being supported.\"    My daughter had spoken with passion and fervour, and her righteous  indignation had moved her to words that caused the magistrate's face to  turn an angry crimson. When I rose to address the Court I began by  assuming an appearance of calmness which I did not altogether feel. I  endorsed all that Christabel had said of the unfairness of our trial and  the malice of the Government; I protested against the trial of political  offenders in a common police court, and I said that we were not women  who would come into the court as ordinary law-breakers. I described Mrs.  Drummond's worthy career as a wife, a mother, and a self-sustaining  business woman. I said, \"Before you decide what is to be done with us,  I should like you to hear from me a statement of what has brought me  into the dock this morning.\" And then I told of my life and experiences,  many of which I have related in these pages of what I had seen and known  as a Poor Law Guardian and a registrar of births and deaths; of how I  had learned the burning necessity of changing the status of women, of  altering the laws under which they and their children live, and of the  essential justice of making women self-governing citizens.    \"I have seen,\" I said, \"that men are encouraged by law to take advantage  of the helplessness of women. Many women have thought as I have, and for  many, many years have tried, by that influence of which we have been so  often reminded, to alter these laws, but we find that influence counts  for nothing.
