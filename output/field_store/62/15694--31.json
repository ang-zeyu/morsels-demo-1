He was as  red as a fox and as yellow-eyed as a cat. He made no effort to escape,  but planted his claws in my forefinger and clung there with a grip that  soon grew uncomfortable. I placed him in the loft of an out-house  in hopes of getting better acquainted with him. By day he was a very  willing prisoner, scarcely moving at all, even when approached and  touched with the hand, but looking out upon the world with half-closed,  sleepy eyes. But at night what a change; how alert, how wild, how  active! He was like another bird; he darted about with wide, fearful  eyes, and regarded me like a cornered cat. I opened the window, and  swiftly, but as silent as a shadow, he glided out into the congenial  darkness, and perhaps, ere this, has revenged himself upon the sleeping  jay or bluebird that first betrayed his hiding-place.          THE APPLE.         Lo! sweetened with the summer light,     The full-juiced apple, waxing over-mellow,     Drops in a silent autumn night.--TENNYSON.      Not a little of the sunshine of our northern winters is surely wrapped  up in the apple. How could we winter over without it! How is life  sweetened by its mild acids! A cellar well filled with apples is more  valuable than a chamber filled with flax and wool. So much sound ruddy  life to draw upon, to strike one's roots down into, as it were.    Especially to those whose soil of life is inclined to be a little clayey  and heavy, is the apple a winter necessity. It is the natural antidote  of most of the ills the flesh is heir to. Full of vegetable acids and  aromatics, qualities which act as refrigerants and antiseptics, what an  enemy it is to jaundice, indigestion, torpidity of liver, etc. It is a  gentle spur and tonic to the whole biliary system. Then I have read that  it has been found by analysis to contain more phosphorus than any  other vegetable. This makes it the proper food of the scholar and the  sedentary man; it feeds his brain and it stimulates his liver. Nor is  this all. Besides its hygienic properties, the apple is full of  sugar and mucilage, which make it highly nutritious. It is said,  \"The operators of Cornwall, England, consider ripe apples nearly  as nourishing as bread, and far more so than potatoes. In the year  1801--which was a year of much scarcity--apples, instead of being  converted into cider, were sold to the poor, and the laborers asserted  that they could 'stand their work' on baked apples without meat; whereas  a potato diet required either meat or some other substantial nutriment.  The French and Germans use apples extensively, so do the inhabitants  of all European nations. The laborers depend upon them as an article of  food, and frequently make a dinner of sliced apples and bread.\"    Yet the English apple is a tame and insipid affair compared with the  intense, sun-colored and sun-steeped fruit our orchards yield.  The English have no sweet apple, I am told, the saccharine element  apparently being less abundant in vegetable nature in that sour and  chilly climate than in our own. It is well known that the European maple  yields no sugar, while both our birch and hickory have sweet in their  veins. Perhaps this fact accounts for our excessive love of sweets,  which may be said to be a national trait.    The Russian apple has a lovely complexion, smooth and transparent,  but the Cossack is not yet all eliminated from it. The only one I have  seen--the Duchess of Oldenburg--is as beautiful as a Tartar princess,  with a distracting odor, but it is the least bit puckery to the taste.    The best thing I know about Chili is not its guano beds, but this fact  which I learn from Darwin's \"Voyage,\" namely, that the apple thrives  well there. Darwin saw a town there so completely buried in a wood of  apple-trees, that its streets were merely paths in an orchard. The tree  indeed thrives so well, that large branches cut off in the spring and  planted two or three feet deep in the ground send out roots and develop  into fine full-bearing trees by the third year. The people know the  value of the apple too. They make cider and wine of it and then from  the refuse a white and finely flavored spirit; then by another process  a sweet treacle is obtained called honey. The children and the pigs eat  little or no other food. He does not add that the people are healthy  and temperate, but I have no doubt they are. We knew the apple had many  virtues, but these Chilians have really opened a deep beneath a deep.  We had found out the cider and the spirits, but who guessed the wine and  the honey, unless it were the bees? There is a variety in our orchards  called the winesap, a doubly liquid name that suggests what might be  done with this fruit.    The apple is the commonest and yet the most varied and beautiful of  fruits. A dish of them is as becoming to the centre-table in winter as  was the vase of flowers in the summer,--a bouquet of spitzenbergs and  greenings and northern spies. A rose when it blooms, the apple is a rose  when it ripens. It pleases every sense to which it can be addressed, the  touch, the smell, the sight, the taste; and when it falls in the still  October days it pleases the ear. It is a call to a banquet, it is a  signal that the feast is ready. The bough would fain hold it, but it can  now assert its independence; it can now live a life of its own.    Daily the stem relaxes its hold, till finally it lets go completely, and  down comes the painted sphere with a mellow thump to the earth, towards  which it has been nodding so long. It bounds away to seek its bed,  to hide under a leaf, or in a tuft of grass. It will now take time to  meditate and ripen! What delicious thoughts it has there nestled with  its fellows under the fence, turning acid into sugar, and sugar into  wine!    How pleasing to the touch! I love to stroke its polished rondure with  my hand, to carry it in my pocket on my tramp over the winter hills, or  through the early spring woods. You are company, you red-cheeked spitz,  or you salmon-fleshed greening! I toy with you; press your face to mine,  toss you in the air, roll you on the ground, see you shine out where you  lie amid the moss and dry leaves and sticks. You are so alive! You glow  like a ruddy flower. You look so animated I almost expect to see you  move. I postpone the eating of you, you are so beautiful! How compact;  how exquisitely tinted! Stained by the sun and varnished against the  rains. An independent vegetable existence, alive and vascular as my own  flesh; capable of being wounded, bleeding, wasting away, and almost of  repairing damages!    How it resists the cold! holding out almost as long as the red cheeks  of the boys do. A frost that destroys the potatoes and other roots only  makes the apple more crisp and vigorous; it peeps out from the chance  November snows unscathed. When I see the fruit-vender on the street  corner stamping his feet and beating his hands to keep them warm, and  his naked apples lying exposed to the blasts, I wonder if they do not  ache too to clap their hands and enliven their circulation. But they can  stand it nearly as long as the vender can.    Noble common fruit, best friend of man and most loved by him, following  him like his dog or his cow, wherever he goes. His homestead is not  planted till you are planted, your roots intertwine with his; thriving  best where he thrives best, loving the limestone and the frost, the  plow and the pruning-knife, you are indeed suggestive of hardy, cheerful  industry, and a healthy life in the open air. Temperate, chaste fruit!  you mean neither luxury nor sloth, neither satiety nor indolence,  neither enervating heats nor the Frigid Zones. Uncloying fruit, fruit  whose best sauce is the open air, whose finest flavors only he whose  taste is sharpened by brisk work or walking knows; winter fruit, when  the fire of life burns brightest; fruit always a little hyperborean,  leaning towards the cold; bracing, sub-acid, active fruit. I think you  must come from the north, you are so frank and honest, so sturdy and  appetizing. You are stocky and homely like the northern races. Your  quality is Saxon. Surely the fiery and impetuous south is not akin to  you. Not spices or olives or the sumptuous liquid fruits, but the grass,  the snow, the grains, the coolness is akin to you. I think if I could  subsist on you or the like of you, I should never have an intemperate  or ignoble thought, never be feverish or despondent. So far as I could  absorb or transmute your quality I should be cheerful, continent,  equitable, sweet-blooded, long-lived, and should shed warmth and  contentment around.    Is there any other fruit that has so much facial expression as the  apple? What boy does not more than half believe they can see with that  single eye of theirs? Do they not look and nod to him from the bough?  The swaar has one look, the rambo another, the spy another. The youth  recognizes the seek-no-further buried beneath a dozen other varieties,  the moment he catches a glance of its eye, or the bonny-cheeked Newtown  pippin, or the gentle but sharp-nosed gilliflower. He goes to the great  bin in the cellar and sinks his shafts here and there in the garnered  wealth of the orchards, mining for his favorites, sometimes coming plump  upon them, sometimes catching a glimpse of them to the right or left,  or uncovering them as keystones in an arch made up of many varieties.  In the dark he can usually tell them by the sense of touch. There is  not only the size and shape, but there is the texture and polish. Some  apples are coarse grained and some are fine; some are thin-skinned and  some are thick. One variety is quick and vigorous beneath the touch;  another gentle and yielding. The pinnock has a thick skin with a spongy  lining, a bruise in it becomes like a piece of cork. The tallow apple  has an unctuous feel, as its name suggests.

In the above the text calls only for the embellishments of the  Haggadah.  In the following passage from Rashi's commentaries the  place allotted to Derash is more limited.        4. CONSTRUCTION OF THE TABERNACLE (Ex. xxv. 1 <I>et seq.</I>)       2. <I>Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring me an     offering</I>].  To me; in my honor.  An offering (<H>terumah     (Tav Resh Vav Mem He)</H>), a levy; let them make a levy upon     their goods.  <I>Of every man that giveth it willingly with     his heart</I> (<H>idbenu (Yod Dalet Bet Nun Vav)</H>), same     meaning as <H>nedava (Nun Dalet Bet He),</H> that is to say, a     voluntary and spontaneous gift.[75]  <I>Ye shall take my     offering</I>] Our sages say: Three offerings are prescribed by     this passage, one of a <I>beka</I> from each person, used for     a pedestal, as will be shown in detail in <I>Eleh     Pekude</I>[76]; the second, the contribution of the altar,     consisting of a <I>beka</I> from each person, thrown into the     coffers for the purchase of congre gational sacrifices; and,     third, the contribution for the Tabernacle, a free-will     offering.  The thirteen kinds of material to be mentioned were     all necessary for the construction of the Tabernacle and for     the making of priestly vestments, as will be evident from a     close examination.       3. <I>Gold, and silver, and brass</I>].  All these were offered     voluntarily, each man giving what he wished, except silver, of     which each brought the same quantity, a half-shekel a person.     In the entire passage relating to the construction of the     Tabernacle, we do not see that more silver was needed; this is     shown by Ex. xxxviii. 27.  The rest of the silver,     voluntarily offered, was used for making the sacred vessels.       4. <H>Tejelet (Tav Kaf Lamed Tav)</H>].

R. Tanhuma explains: The patriarch Jacob,     thanks to a Divine revelation, had foreseen that one day his     de  scendants would construct a Tabernacle in the desert.  He,     therefore, carried shittim trees into Egypt, and planted them     there, advising his sons to take them along with them when     they left the country.       6. <I>Oil for the light</I>].  \"Pure <I>oil olive</I> beaten     for the light, to cause the lamp to burn always.\"[79]     <I>Spices for anointing oil</I>].

Spices entered into the composition of this     oil, as is said in K<I>Ki-Tissa.</I>[80]  <I>And for sweet     incense</I>] which was burned night and morning, as is     described in detail in <I>Tezaweh.</I>[81]  As to the word     <H>ketoret (Qof Mem Resh Tav),</H> it comes from the rising of     the smoke (<H>Kitor (Qof Mem Vav Resh)</H>).       7. <I>Onyx stones</I>].  Two were needed for the ephod,     described in <I>Tezaweh.</I>[82]  <I>And stones to be set</I>]     for an ouch of gold was made in which the stones were set,     entirely filling it.  These stones are called \"stones to be     set.\"  As to the bezel it is called <H>mishbetzet (Mem Shin     Bet Tsadi Tav.</H>  <I>In the ephod, and in the     breastplate</I>].  Onyx stones for the ephod and \"stones to be     set\" for the breastplate.  The breastplate as well as the     ephod are described in <I>Tezaweh</I>[83]; they are two sorts     of ornaments.    If these citations did not suffice, his anti-Christian polemics  would furnish ample evidence of the wise use Rashi made of the  Peshat.  The word polemics, perhaps, is not exact.  Rashi does  not make assaults upon Christianity; he contents himself with  showing that a verse which the Church has adopted for its own  ends, when rationally interpreted, has an entirely different  meaning and application.  Only to this extent can Rashi be said  to have written polemics against the Christians.  However that  may be, no other course is possible; for the history of Adam and  Eve or the blessing of Jacob cannot be explained, unless one  takes a stand for or against Christianity.  It was not difficult  to refute Christian doctrines; Rashi could easily dispose of the  stupid or extravagant inventions of Christian exegesis.  Sometimes he does not name the adversaries against whom he aimed;  sometimes he openly says he has in view the <I>Minim</I> or  \"Sectaries,\" that is, the Christians.  The Church, it is well  known, transformed chiefly the Psalms into predictions of  Christianity.  In order to ward off such an interpretation and  not to expose themselves to criticism, many Jewish exegetes gave  up that explanation of the Psalms by which they are held to be  proclamations of the Messianic era, and would see in them  allusions only to historic facts.  Rashi followed this tendency;  and for this reason, perhaps, his commentary on the Psalms is one  of the most satisfying from a scientific point of view.  For  instance, he formally states: \"Our masters apply this passage to  the Messiah; but in order to refute the Minim, it is better to  apply it to David.\"    One would wish that Rashi had on all occasions sought the simple  and natural meaning of the Biblical text.  That he clothed the  Song of Songs, in part at least, in a mantle of allegory, is  excusable, since he was authorized, nay, obliged, to do so by  tradition.  In the Proverbs this manner is less tolerable.  The  book is essentially secular in character; but Rashi could not  take it in this way.  To him it was an allegory; and he  transformed this manual of practical wisdom into a prolonged  conversation between the Torah and Israel.  Again, though Rashi  discriminated among the Midrashim, and adopted only those that  seemed reconcilable with the natural meaning, his commentaries  none the less resemble Haggadic compilations.  This is true,  above all, of the Pentateuch.  And if the Haggadah \"so far as  religion is concerned was based upon the oral law, and from an  esthetic point of view upon the apparent improprieties of the  Divine word,\" it nevertheless \"serves as a pretext rather than a  text for the flights, sometimes the caprice or digressions, of  religious thought.\"[84]  Now, Rashi was so faithful to the spirit  of the Midrash that he accepted without wincing the most curious  and shocking explanations, or, if he rejected them, it was not  because he found fault with the explanations themselves.  Sometimes, when we see him balance the simple construction  against the Midrashic interpretation of the text, we are annoyed  to feel how he is drawn in opposite directions by two tendencies.  We realize that in consequence his works suffer from a certain  incoherence, or lack of equilibrium, that they are uneven and  mixed in character.  To recognize that he paid tribute to the  taste of the age, or yielded to the attraction the Midrash  exercised upon a soul of naive faith, is not sufficient, for in  point of fact he pursued the two methods at the same time, the  method of literal and the method of free interpretation, seeming  to have considered them equally legitimate and fruitful of  results.  Often, it is true, he shakes off the authority of  tradition, and we naturally query why his good sense did not  always assert itself, and free him from the tentacles of the  Talmud and the Midrash.    Now that we have formulated our grievance against Rashi, it is  fair that we try to justify him by recalling the ideas prevailing  at the time, and the needs he wished to satisfy.    The Midrashim, as I have said, have a double object, on the one  hand, the exposition of legal and religious practices, on the  other hand, the exposition of the beliefs and hopes of religion.  So far as the Halakic Midrash is concerned, it was marvellously  [marvelously sic] well adapted to the French-Jewish intellect,  penetrated as it was by Talmudism.  The study of"]]]
