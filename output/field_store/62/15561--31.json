War Department, Washington City, Feb. 21, 1868.    Sir:--Gen. Thomas has just delivered to me a copy of the enclosed order,  which you will please communicate to the House of Representatives.    (Signed) E. M. Stanton, Secretary of War. Hon. Schuyler Colfax, Speaker  House of Representatives.      This gave new life to the impeachment cause, which had a few weeks  before been defeated in the House and since then had, for lack of  material, been laming, to the discouragement of many of its advocates:  and the gleeful ejaculations, on the floor of the House, in the lobbies,  and on the streets, on receipt of this news, and more especially after  the action of the Senate became known, which was not long in reaching  the public, with a common greeting slid clasping of hands: \"Well, we've  got him now!\"    The communication of Mr. Stanton to the House of Representatives was  immediately, after reading, referred to the Committee on Reconstruction.    In the evening of the same day, Mr. Covode, of Pennsylvania, offered a  resolution to impeach the President, which was also referred to the same  Committee.    On the next day, Feb. 22d, 1868, Mr. Stevens, Chairman of that  Committee, made the following report:    The Committee on Reconstruction, to whom was referred, on the 27th day  of January last, the following resolution:    \"Resolved, That the Committee on Reconstruction be authorized to inquire  what combinations have been made or attempted to be made to obstruct the  due execution of the laws; and to that end the committee have power  to send for persons and papers and to examine witnesses oil oath, and  report to this House what action, if any, they may deem necessary; and  that said committee bade leave to report at any time.\"    And to whom was also referred, on the 21st day of February, instant,  a communication from Hon. Edwin M. Stanton, Secretary of War, dated on  said 21st day of February, together with a copy of a letter from Andrew  Johnson, President of the United States, to the said Edwin M. Stanton,  as follows:    Executive Mansion, Washington. D. C., Feb. 21, 1868.    Sir:-By virtue of the power and authority vested in me, as President, by  the Constitution and laws of the United States, you are hereby removed  from office as Secretary for the Department of War, and your functions  as such will terminate upon the receipt of this communication.    You will transfer to Brevet Major General Lorenzo Thomas, Adjutant  General of the Army, who has this day been authorized and empowered  to act as Secretary of War ad interim, all records, books, papers, and  other public property now in your custody and charge.    Respectfully yours. Andrew Johnson. Hon. Edwin M. Stanton, Washington,  D. C.      And to whom was also referred by the House of Representatives the  following resolution, namely:    \"Resolved, That Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, be  impeached of high crimes and misdemeanors.\"    Have considered the several subjects referred to them, and submit the  following report:    That in addition to the papers referred to the committee, the committee  find that the President, on the 21st day of February, 1868, signed  and issued a commission or letter of authority to one Lorenzo Thomas,  directing and authorizing said Thomas to act as Secretary of War ad  interim, and to take possession of the books, records, and papers, and  other public property in the War Department, of which the following is a  copy:    Executive Mansion, Washington, Feb. 21, 1868.    Sir:--Hon. Edwin M. Stanton having been this day removed from office  as Secretary for the Department of War, you are hereby authorized and  empowered to act as Secretary of War ad interim, and will immediately  enter upon the discharge of the duties pertaining to that office. Mr.  Stanton has been instructed to transfer to you all the records, books,  papers, and other public property now in his custody and charge.    Respectfully yours, Andrew Johnson.    To Brevet Major General Lorenzo Thomas, Adjutant General of the United  States Army. Washington, District of Columbia.    Official copy respectfully furnished to Hon. Edwin M. Stanton.    L. Thomas. Secretary of War ad interim.      Upon the evidence collected by the committee, which is herewith  presented, and in virtue of the powers with which they have been  invested by the House, they are of the opinion that Andrew Johnson,  President of the United States, be impeached of high crimes and  misdemeanors. They therefore recommend to the House the adoption of the  accompanying resolution. Thaddeus Stevens, George S. Boutwell, John A.  Bingham, C. T. Hulburd, John F. Farnsworth, F. C. Beaman, H. E. Paine.      Resolution providing for the impeachment of Andrew Johnson, President of  the United States.    Resolved, That Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, be  impeached of high crimes and misdemeanors in office.    The following is a brief synopsis of the debate which ensued: Mr.  Stevens, of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, it is not my intention in the  first instance to discuss this question; and if there be no desire on  the other side to discuss it we are willing that the question should be  taken upon the knowledge which the House already has. Indeed, the fact  of removing a man from office while the Senate was in session without  the consent of the Senate, if there were nothing else, is of itself, and  always has been considered, a high crime and misdemeanor, and was never  before practiced. But I will not discuss this question unless gentlemen  on the other side desire to discuss it. It they do, I shall for the  present give way to them and say what I have to say in conclusion.    Mr. Brooke, (Dem. of N. Y.) Mr. Speaker, I had hoped to have an  opportunity, at least, to submit a minority report before we entered  upon this august proceeding of impeaching the chief executive officer of  this Government. But after a session of the Committee on Reconstruction,  hardly an hour in length, violating an express rule of this House by  sitting during the session--for Rule 72, provides that no committee shall  sit during the session of the House without special leave--we have  been summoned upon a very partial submission of facts, without any  comprehension, in reality, of the charges which are made against the  President of they United States, upon a new indictment, in a new form  once more, and in a more alarming manner than ever, in this but a  partial Congress, representing but a section of a portion of the  people--in my judgment not representing the people of the United States  at all--to act as a grand jury, with a large portion of that grand jury  excluded from the jury-room here; and suddenly, impromptu perhaps, a vote  is to be forced this very day--to impeach the President of the United  States!    I am utterly inadequate to discharge the duty which has devolved upon me  on this august day, the anniversary of the birthday of the Father of his  country. I am utterly unable upon this occasion either to do my duty to  the people or to express myself with that deep solemnity which I feel  in rising to resist this untoward, this unholy, this unconstitutional  proceeding. Indeed, I know not why the ghost of impeachment has appeared  here in a new form. We have attempted to lay it hitherto, and we have  successfully laid it upon the floor of this House. But a minority of  the party on the other side, forcing its influence and its power upon  a majority of a committee of this House, has at last succeeded in  compelling its party to approach the House itself in a united, and  therefore in a more solemn form, and to demand the impeachment of the  President of the United States.    Sir, we have long been in the midst of a revolution. Long, long has our  country been agitated by the throes of that revolution. But we are now  approaching the last and the final stage of that revolution in which,  like many revolutions that have preceded it, a legislative power not  representing the people attempts to depose the executive power, and thus  to overthrow that constitutional branch of the Government.    There is nothing new in all this. There is nothing new in what we are  doing, for men of the present but repeat the history of the past. We are  traversing over and over again the days of Cromwell and Charles I and  Charles II, and we are traversing over and over again the scenes of the  French revolution, baptized in blood in our introductory part, but I  trust in God never again to be baptized by any revolutionary proceeding  on the part of this House.    I have not and never have been a defender of all the opinions of  General Jackson, but those on the other side who pretend to hold him  as authority and those on this side who have ever held him as authority  will find that in uttering the opinions which I have I but reutter the  opinions which he advanced in his veto of July 10, 1832, when he said:    \"The Congress, the Executive, and the court must each for itself be  guided by its own opinion of the Constitution. Each public officer who  takes the oath to support the Constitution swears that he will support  it as he understands it, and not as it is understood by others.\"    The President of the United States has given his opinion upon the  official tenure-of-office act and upon the Constitution of the United  States by the appointment of Adjutant General Thomas as Secretary of War  ad interim. and because of the exercise of that Constitutional right we  are called upon here at once to pronounce him guilty of high crimes and  misdemeanors and to demand his deposition and degradation therefor. * *  * * *    Mr. Spalding, (Rep. of Ohio). Mr. Speaker, I feel myself to be in no  proper frame of mind or heart to attempt rhetorical display on this  occasion. I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2443"],[0,"The Story of the Mormons, from the Date of Their Origin to the Year 1901 (#20)"],[1,"Disciples' church, Rigdon sprung on the meeting an  argument in favor of a community of goods, holding that the apostles  established this system at Jerusalem, and that the modern church, which  rested on their example, must follow them. Alexander Campbell, who was  present, at once controverted this position, showing that the apostles,  as narrated in Acts, \"sold their possessions\" instead of combining them  for a profit, and citing Bible texts to prove that no \"community system\"  existed in the early church. This argument carried the meeting,  and Rigdon left the assemblage, embittered against Campbell beyond  forgiveness. To a brother in Warren, on his way home, he declared, \"I  have done as much in this reformation as Campbell or Scott, and yet they  get all the honor of it.\" This claim is set forth specifically in the  sketch of Rigdon in Smith's autobiography. Referring to Rigdon and  Alexander Campbell, this statement is there made:--    \"After they had separated from the different churches, these gentlemen  were on terms of the greatest friendship, and frequently met together to  discuss the subject of religion, being yet undetermined respecting the  principles of the doctrine of Christ or what course to pursue. However,  from this connection sprung up a new church in the world, known by the  name of 'Campbellites'; they call themselves 'Disciples.' The reason  why they were called Campbellites was in consequence of Mr. Campbell's  periodical, above mentioned [the Christian Baptist], and it being the  means through which they communicated their sentiments to the world;  other than this, Mr. Campbell was no more the originator of the sect  than Elder Rigdon.\"    Rigdon's bitterness against the Campbells and his old church more  than once manifested itself in his later writings. For instance, in  an article in the Messenger and Advocate (Kirtland), of June, 1837,  he said: \"One thing has been done by the coming forth of the Book of  Mormon. It has puked the Campbellites effectually; no emetic could have  done so half as well.... The Book of Mormon has revealed the secrets of  Campbellism and unfolded the end of the system.\" In this jealousy of the  Campbells, and the discomfiture as a leader which he received at their  hands, we find a sufficient object for Rigdon's desertion of his old  church associations and desire to build up something, the discovery of  which he could claim, and the government of which he could control.    To understand the strength of the argument that the doctrinal teachings  of the Mormon Bible were the work of a Disciples' preacher rather  than of the ne'er-do-well Smith, it is only necessary to examine  the teachings of the Disciples' church in Ohio at that time. The  investigator will be startled by the resemblance between what was then  taught to and believed by Disciples' congregations and the leading  beliefs of the Mormon Bible. In the following examples of this the  illustrations of Disciples' beliefs and teachings are taken from  Hayden's \"Early History of the Disciples' Church in the Western  Reserve.\"    The literal interpretation of the Scriptures, on which the Mormon  defenders of their faith so largely depend,--as for explanations of  modern revelations, miracles, and signs,--was preached to so extreme a  point by Ohio Disciples that Alexander Campbell had to combat them in  his Millennial Harbinger. An outcome of this literal interpretation was  a belief in a speedy millennium, another fundamental belief of the early  Mormon church. \"The hope of the millennial glory,\" says Hayden, \"was  based on many passages of the Holy Scriptures.... Millennial hymns were  learned and sung with a joyful fervor.... It is surprising even now,  as memory returns to gather up these interesting remains of that mighty  work, to recall the thorough and extensive knowledge which the convert  quickly obtained. Nebuchadnezzar's vision... many portions of the  Revelation were so thoroughly studied that they became the staple of  the common talk.\" Rigdon's old Pittsburg friend, Scott, in his report  as evangelist to the church association at Warren in 1828, said:  \"Individuals eminently skilled in the word of God, the history of the  world, and the progress of human improvements see reasons to expect  great changes, much greater than have yet occurred, and which shall give  to political society and to the church a different, a very different,  complexion from what many anticipate. The millennium--the millennium  described in the Scriptures--will doubtless be a wonder, a terrible  wonder, to all.\"    Disciples' preachers understood that they spoke directly for God, just  as Smith assumed to do in his \"revelations.\" Referring to the preaching  of Rigdon and Bentley, after a visit to Scott in March, 1828, Hayden  says, \"They spoke with authority, for the word which they delivered was  not theirs, but that of Jesus Christ.\" The Disciples, like the Mormons,  at that time looked for the return of the Jews to Jerusalem. Scott* was  an enthusiastic preacher of this. \"The fourteenth chapter of Zechariah,\"  says Hayden, \"was brought forward in proof--all considered as  literal--that the most marvellous and stupendous physical and climatic  changes were to be wrought in Palestine; and that Jesus Christ the  Messiah was to reign literally in Jerusalem, and in Mount Zion, and  before his ancients, gloriously.\"         * \"In a letter to Dr. Richardson, written in 1830, he [Scott]  says the book of Elias Smith on the prophecies is the only sensible  work on that subject he had seen. He thinks this and Crowley on the  Apocalypse all the student of the Bible wants. He strongly commends  Smith's book to the doctor. This seems to be the origin of millennial  views among us. Rigdon, who always caught and proclaimed the last word  that fell from the lips of Scott or Campbell, seized these views (about  the millennium and the Jews) and, with the wildness of his extravagant  nature, heralded them everywhere.\"--\"Early History of the Disciples'  Church in the Western Reserve,\" p. 186.      Campbell taught that \"creeds are but statements, with few exceptions,  of doctrinal opinion or speculators' views of philosophical or dogmatic  subjects, and tended to confusion, disunion, and weakness.\" Orson Pratt,  in his \"Divine Authenticity of the Book of Mormon,\" thus stated the  early Mormon view on the same subject: \"If any man or council, without  the aid of immediate revelation, shall undertake to decide upon such  subjects, and prescribe 'articles of faith' or 'creeds' to govern the  belief or views of others, there will be thousands of well-meaning  people who will not have confidence in the productions of these  fallible men, and, therefore, frame creeds of their own.... In this way  contentions arise.\"    Finally, attention may be directed to the emphatic declarations of the  Disciples' doctrine of baptism in the Mormon Bible:--    \"Ye shall go down and stand in the water, and in my name shall ye  baptize them.... And then shall ye immerse them in the water, and come  forth again out of the water.\"--3 Nephi Xi. 23, 26.    \"I know that it is solemn mockery before God that ye should baptize  little children.... He that supposeth that little children need baptism  is in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity; for he hath  neither faith, hope, nor charity; wherefore, should he be cut off while  in the thought, he must go down to hell. For awful is the wickedness to  suppose that God saveth one child because of baptism, and the other must  perish because he hath no baptism.\"--Moroni viii. 9, xc, 15.    There are but three conclusions possible from all this: that the Mormon  Bible was a work of inspiration, and that the agreement of its doctrines  with Disciples' belief only proves the correctness of the latter; that  Smith, in writing his doctrinal views, hit on the Disciples' tenets by  chance (he had had no opportunity whatever to study them); or, finally,  that some Disciple, learned in the church, supplied these doctrines to  him.    Advancing another step in the examination of Rigdon's connection with  the scheme, we find that even the idea of a new Bible was common belief  among the Ohio Disciples who listened to Scott's teaching. Describing  Scott's preaching in the winter of 1827-1828, Hayden says:--    \"He contended ably for the restoration of the true, original apostolic  order which would restore to the church the ancient gospel as preached  by the apostles. The interest became an excitement;... the air was thick  with rumors of a 'new religion,' a 'new Bible.'\"    Next we may cite two witnesses to show that Rigdon had a knowledge  of Smith's Bible in advance of its publication. His brother-in-law,  Bentley, in a letter to Walter Scott dated January 22, 1841, said,  \"I know that Sidney Rigdon told me there was a book coming out, the  manuscript of which had been found engraved on gold plates, as much as  two years before the Mormon book made its appearance or had been heard  of by me.\"*         * Millennial Harbinger, 1844, p. 39. The Rev. Alexander Campbell  testified that this conversation took place in his presence.      One of the elders of the Disciples' church was Darwin Atwater, a  farmer, who afterward occupied the pulpit, and of whom Hayden says,  \"The uniformity of his life, his undeviating devotion, his high and  consistent manliness and superiority of judgment, gave him an undisputed  preeminence in the church.\" In a letter to Hayden, dated April 26,  1873, Mr. Atwater said of Rigdon: \"For a few months before his professed  conversion to Mormonism it was noticed that his wild extravagant  propensities had been more marked. That he knew before the coming of the  Book of Mormon is to me certain from what he said during the first  of his visits at my father's, some years before. He gave a wonderful  description of the mounds and other antiquities found in some parts of  America,"]]]
