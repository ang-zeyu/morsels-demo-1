See! on a blessed night2 have we sent it down, for we would warn mankind:    On the night wherein all things are disposed in wisdom,3    By virtue of our behest. Lo! we have ever sent forth Apostles,    A mercy from thy Lord: he truly heareth and knoweth all things-    Lord of the Heavens and of the Earth and of all that is between them,-if ye  be firm in faith-    There is no God but He!-He maketh alive and killeth!-Your Lord and the Lord  of your sires of old!    Yet with doubts do they disport them.    But mark them on the day when the Heaven shall give out a palpable SMOKE,    Which shall enshroud mankind: this will be an afflictive torment.    They will cry, \"Our Lord! relieve us from this torment: see! we are  believers.\"    But how did warning avail them, when an undoubted apostle had come to them;    And they turned their backs on him, and said, \"Taught by others, possessed?\"    Were we to relieve you from the plague even a little, ye would certainly  relapse.4    On the day when we shall fiercely put forth our great fierceness, we will  surely take vengeance on them!    Of old, before their time, had we proved the people of Pharaoh, when a noble  apostle presented himself to them.    \"Send away with me,\" cried he, \"the servants of God; for I am an apostle  worthy of all credit:    And exalt not yourselves against God, for I come to you with undoubted power;    And I take refuge with Him who is my Lord and your Lord, that ye stone me  not:    And if ye believe me not, at least separate yourselves from me.\"    And he cried to his Lord, \"That these are a wicked people.\"    \"March forth then, said God, with my servants by night, for ye will be  pursued.    And leave behind you the cleft sea: they are a drowned host.\"    How many a garden and fountain did they quit!    And corn fields and noble dwellings!    And pleasures in which they rejoiced them!    So was it: and we gave them as a heritage to another people.    Nor Heaven nor Earth wept for them, nor was their sentence respited;    And we rescued the children of Israel from a degrading affliction-    From Pharaoh, for he was haughty, given to excess.    And we chose them, in our prescience, above all peoples,5    And we shewed them miracles wherein was their clear trial.    Yet these infidels say,    \"There is but our first death, neither shall we be raised again:    Bring back our sires, if ye be men of truth.\"    Are they better than the people of Tobba,6    And those who flourished before them whom we destroyed for their evil deeds?    We have not created the Heavens and the Earth and whatever is between them in  sport:    We have not created them but for a serious end:7 but the greater part of them  understand it not.    Verily the day of severing8 shall be the appointed time of all:    A day when the master shall not at all be aided by the servant, neither shall  they be helped;    Save those on whom God shall have mercy: for He is the mighty, the merciful.    Verily the tree of Ez-Zakkoum9    Shall be the sinner's10 food:    Like dregs of oil shall it boil up in their bellies,    Like the boiling of scalding water.    \"-Seize ye him, and drag him into the mid-fire;    Then pour on his head of the tormenting boiling water.    -'Taste this:' for thou forsooth art the mighty, the honourable!    Lo! this is that of which ye doubted.\"    But the pious shall be in a secure place,    Amid gardens and fountains,    Clothed in silk and richest robes, facing one another:    Thus shall it be: and we will wed them to the virgins with large dark eyes:    Therein shall they call, secure, for every kind of fruit;    Therein, their first death passed, shall they taste death no more; and He  shall keep them from the pains of Hell:-    'Tis the gracious bounty of thy Lord! This is the great felicity.    We have made this Koran easy for thee in thine own tongue, that they may take  the warning.    Therefore wait thou, for they are waiting.11    _______________________    1 See Sura lxviii.

By the glorious Koran:    They marvel forsooth that one of themselves hath come to them charged with  warnings. \"This,\" say the infidels, \"is a marvellous thing:    What! when dead and turned to dust shall we. . . .? Far off is such a return  as this?\"    Now know we what the earth consumeth of them, and with us is a Book in which  account is kept.    But they have treated the truth which hath come to them as falsehood;  perplexed therefore is their state.    Will they not look up to the heaven above them, and consider how we have  reared it and decked it forth, and that there are no flaws therein?    And as to the earth, we have spread it out, and have thrown the mountains  upon it, and have caused an upgrowth in it of all beauteous kinds of plants,    For insight and admonition to every servant who loveth to turn to God:    And we send down the rain from Heaven with its blessings, by which we cause  gardens to spring forth and the grain of harvest,    And the tall palm trees with date-bearing branches one above the other    For man's nourishment: And life give we thereby to a dead country. So also  shall be the resurrection.    Ere the days of these (Meccans) the people of Noah, and the men of Rass2 and  Themoud, treated their prophets as impostors:    And Ad and Pharaoh, and the brethren of Lot and the dwellers in the forest,  and the people of Tobba,3 all gave the lie to their prophets: justly,  therefore, were the menaces inflicted.    Are we wearied out with the first creation? Yet are they in doubt with regard  to a new creation!4    We created man: and we know what his soul whispereth to him, and we are  closer to him than his neck-vein.    When the two angels charged with taking account shall take it, one sitting on  the right hand, the other on the left:    Not a word doth he utter, but there is a watcher with him ready to note it  down:    And the stupor of certain death cometh upon him: \"This is what thou wouldst  have shunned\"-    And there shall be a blast on the trumpet,-it is the threatened day!    And every soul shall come,-an angel with it urging it along, and an angel to  witness against it5-    Saith he, \"Of this day didst thou live in heedlessness: but we have taken off  thy veil from thee, and thy sight is becoming sharp this day.\"    And he who is at this side6 shall say, \"This is what I am prepared with  against thee.\"    And God will say, \"Cast into Hell, ye twain, every infidel, every hardened  one,    The hinderer of the good, the transgressor, the doubter,    Who set up other gods with God. Cast ye him into the fierce torment.\"    He who is at his side shall say, \"O our Lord! I led him not astray, yet was  he in an error wide of truth.\"    He shall say, \"Wrangle not in my presence. I had plied you beforehand with  menaces:    My doom changeth not, and I am not unjust to man.\"    On that day will we cry to Hell, \"Art thou full?\" And it shall say, \"Are  there more?\"7    And not far from thence shall Paradise be brought near unto the Pious:    - \"This is what ye have been promised: to every one who hath turned in  penitence to God and kept his laws;    Who hath feared the God of Mercy in secret, and come to him with a contrite  heart:    Enter it in peace: this is the day of Eternity.\"    There shall they have all that they can desire: and our's will it be to  augment their bliss:    And how many generations have we destroyed ere the days of these (Meccans),  mightier than they in strength! Search ye then the land. Is there any escape?    Lo! herein is warning for him who hath a heart, or giveth ear, and is himself  an eye-witness.8    We created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six  days, and no weariness touched us.9    Wherefore put up with what they say, and celebrate the praise of thy Lord  before sunrise and before sunset:    And praise Him in the night: and perform the two final prostrations.    And list for the day whereon the crier shall cry from a place near to every  one alike:    The day on which men shall in truth hear that shout will be the day of their  coming forth from the grave.    Verily, we cause to live, and we cause to die. To us shall all return.    On the day when the earth shall swiftly cleave asunder over the dead, will  this gathering be easy to Us.

Warn"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28019"],[0,"Birds in the Bush (#20)"],[1,"and orchards; the bluebird goes so far, indeed, as to accept  our hospitality outright, building his nest in boxes put up for his  accommodation, and making the roofs of our houses his favorite perching  stations. But, while the robin is noisily and jauntily familiar, the  bluebird maintains a dignified aloofness; coming and going about the  premises, but keeping his thoughts to himself, and never becoming one of  us save by the mere accident of local proximity. The robin, again, loves  to travel in large flocks, when household duties are over for the  season; but although the same has been reported of the bluebird, I have  never myself seen such a thing, and am satisfied that, as a rule, this  gentle spirit finds a family party of six or seven company enough. His  reticence, as we cheerfully admit, is nothing to quarrel with; it is all  well-bred, and not in the least unkindly; in fact, we like it, on the  whole, rather better than the robin's pertness and garrulity; but, none  the less, its natural consequence is that the bird has small concern for  musical display. When he sings, it is not to gain applause, but to  express his affection; and while, in one aspect of the case, there is  nothing out of the way in this,--since his affection need not be the  less deep and true because it is told in few words and with unadorned  phrase,--yet, as I said to begin with, it is hard not to feel that the  world is being defrauded, when for any reason, however amiable, the  possessor of such a matchless voice has no ambition to make the most of  it.    It is always a double pleasure to find a plodding, humdrum-seeming man  with a poet's heart in his breast; and a little of the same delighted  surprise is felt by every one, I imagine, when he learns for the first  time that our little brown creeper is a singer. What life could possibly  be more prosaic than his? Day after day, year in and out, he creeps up  one tree-trunk after another, pausing only to peer right and left into  the crevices of the bark, in search of microscopic tidbits. A most  irksome sameness, surely! How the poor fellow must envy the swallows,  who live on the wing, and, as it were, have their home in heaven! So it  is easy for us to think; but I doubt whether the creeper himself is  troubled with such suggestions. He seems, to say the least, as well  contented as the most of us; and, what is more, I am inclined to doubt  whether any except \"free moral agents,\" like ourselves, are ever wicked  enough to find fault with the orderings of Divine Providence. I fancy,  too, that we may have exaggerated the monotony of the creeper's lot. It  can scarcely be that even his days are without their occasional  pleasurable excitements. After a good many trees which yield little or  nothing for his pains, he must now and then light upon one which is like  Canaan after the wilderness,--\"a land flowing with milk and honey.\"  Indeed, the longer I think of it the more confident I feel that every  aged creeper must have had sundry experiences of this sort, which he is  never weary of recounting for the edification of his nephews and nieces,  who, of course, are far too young to have anything like the wide  knowledge of the world which their venerable three-years-old uncle  possesses. _Certhia_ works all day for his daily bread; and yet even of  him it is true that \"the life is more than meat.\" He has his inward  joys, his affectionate delights, which no outward infelicity can touch.  A bird who thinks nothing of staying by his nest and his mate at the  sacrifice of his life is not to be written down a dullard or a drudge,  merely because his dress is plain and his occupation unromantic. He has  a right to sing, for he has something within him to inspire the strain.    There are descriptions of the creeper's music which liken it to a  wren's. I am sorry that I have myself heard it only on one occasion:  then, however, so far was it from being wren-like that it might rather  have been the work of one of the less proficient warblers,--a somewhat  long opening note followed by a hurried series of shorter ones, the  whole given in a sharp, thin voice, and having nothing to recommend it  to notice, considered simply as music. All the while the bird kept on  industriously with his journey up the tree; and it is not in the least  unlikely that he may have another and better song, which he reserves for  times of more leisure.[19]    Our American wood-warblers are all to be classed among the minor  songsters; standing in this respect in strong contrast with the true Old  World warblers, of whose musical capacity enough, perhaps, is said when  it is mentioned that the nightingale is one of them. But, comparisons  apart, our birds are by no means to be despised, and not a few of their  songs have a good degree of merit. That of the well-known summer  yellow-bird may be taken as fairly representative of the entire group,  being neither one of the best nor one of the poorest. He, I have  noticed, is given to singing late in the day. Three of the New England  species have at the same time remarkably rough voices and black  throats,--I mean the black-throated blue, the black-throated green, and  the blue golden-wing,--and seeing that the first two are of the genus  _Dendroeca_, while the last is a _Helminthophaga_, I have allowed  myself to query (half in earnest) whether they may not, possibly, be  more nearly related than the systematists have yet discovered. Several  of the warbler songs are extremely odd. The blue yellow-back's, for  example, is a brief, hoarse, upward run,--a kind of scale exercise; and  if the practice of such things be really as beneficial as music teachers  affirm, it would seem that this little beauty must in time become a  vocalist of the first order. Nearly the same might be said of the  prairie warbler; but his _etude_ is a little longer and less hurried,  besides being in a higher key. I do not call to mind any bird who sings  a downward scale. Having before spoken of the tendency of warblers to  learn two or even three set tunes, I was the more interested when, last  summer, I added another to my list of the species which aspire to this  kind of liberal education. It was on the side of Mount Clinton that I  heard two Blackburnians, both in full sight and within a few rods of  each other, who were singing two entirely distinct songs. One of  these--it is the common one, I think--ended quaintly with three or four  short notes, like _zip_, _zip_, _zip;_ while the other was not unlike a  fraction of the winter wren's melody. Those who are familiar with the  latter bird will perhaps recognize the phrase referred to if I call it  the _willie, willie, winkie,_--with a triple accent on the first  syllable of the last word. Most of the songs of this family are rather  slight, but the extremest case known to me is that of the black-poll  (_Dendroeca striata_), whose _zee, zee, zee_ is almost ridiculously  faint. You may hear it continually in the higher spruce forests of the  White Mountains; but you will look a good many times before you discover  its author, and not improbably will begin by taking it for the call of  the kinglet. The music of the bay-breasted warbler is similar to the  black-poll's, but hardly so weak and formless. It seems reasonable to  believe not only that these two species are descended from a common  ancestry, but that the divergence is of a comparatively recent date:  even now the young of the year can be distinguished only with great  difficulty, although the birds in full feather are clearly enough  marked.    Warblers' songs are often made up of two distinct portions: one given  deliberately, the other hurriedly and with a concluding flourish.  Indeed, the same may be said of bird-songs generally,--those of the song  sparrow, the bay-winged bunting, and the wood thrush being familiar  examples. Yet there are many singers who attempt no climax of this sort,  but make their music to consist of two, or three, or more parts, all  alike. The Maryland yellow-throat, for instance, cries out over and  over, \"What a pity, what a pity, what a pity!\" So, at least, he seems to  say; though, I confess, it is more than likely I mistake the words,  since the fellow never appears to be feeling badly, but, on the  contrary, delivers his message with an air of cordial satisfaction. The  song of the pine-creeping warbler is after still another fashion,--one  simple short trill. It is musical and sweet; the more so for coming  almost always out of a pine-tree.    The vireos, or greenlets, are akin to the warblers in appearance and  habits, and like them are peculiar to the western continent. We have no  birds that are more unsparing of their music (prodigality is one of the  American virtues, we are told): they sing from morning till night,  and--some of them, at least--continue thus till the very end of the  season. It is worth mentioning, however, that the red-eye makes a short  day; becoming silent just at the time when the generality of birds grow  most noisy. Probably the same is true of the rest of the family, but on  that point I am not prepared to speak with positiveness. Of the five New  England species (I omit the brotherly-love greenlet, never having been  fortunate enough to know him) the white-eye is decidedly the most  ambitious, the warbling and the solitary are the most pleasing, while  the red-eye and the yellow-throat are very much alike, and both of them  rather too monotonous and persistent. It is hard, sometimes, not to get  out of patience with the red-eye's ceaseless and noisy iteration of his  trite theme; especially if you are doing your utmost to catch the notes  of some rarer and more refined songster. In my note-book I find an entry  describing my vain attempts to enjoy the music of a rose-breasted  grosbeak,--who at that time had never been a common bird with me,--while  \"a pesky Wagnerian red-eye kept up an"]]]
