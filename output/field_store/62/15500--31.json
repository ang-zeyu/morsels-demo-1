At this time lodgings without fire  were worth dollars a night in crowded Nome, and one's next neighbors  might prove themselves anything but desirable.    Meanwhile we worked steadily. Many of the Anvil Creek mine owners and  their men took meals at the \"Star\" whenever in town. Some of their  office employees came regularly. Hundreds were \"going outside\" on boats,  and all was bustle and excitement. At least twenty-five thousand people  had landed at Nome during the summer, and fully one-half of them had  gone home discouraged.    On Sunday, September second, there came up a most terrible storm, which,  for the velocity of its gales, tremendous downfall of rain, terrific  surf, accompanied by great loss of life, as well as length of duration,  had not been equalled for over twenty years. Never before was the  property loss so great on the Behring Sea coast.    By nine o'clock Sunday morning the large steamers at anchor had put far  out to sea for safety. The wind rose, the rain poured. The surf was  growing more rough. At dinner time those who came in reported the dead  bodies of nine men picked up on the beach. They had attempted to land  from a steamer, and their small boat was swamped. One of the men drowned  was the mate of the vessel. For days the storm lasted and our work  increased. It was not long before the continuous rain had penetrated our  little kitchen roof and walls, roughly built as they were of boards, and  from that on we worked in rubber boots and short skirts tucked still  higher. With the storm at its hardest, I donned a regular \"sou'wester,\"  or water proof hat, rather than stand with the rain dripping upon my  head, and a cape of the same material covered my shoulders.    People living in tents when the storm began--and there were  thousands--had been washed out, or been obliged to leave them, and could  not get their own meals. The \"Star\" swarmed with hundreds who had never  been there before, as well as those in the habit of coming. Ten days  passed. Sometimes there would be a lull in the storm for a few hours and  we hoped it was over, but the surf ran high and could not return before  the wind again lashed it into fury.    One midnight, when I was sleeping soundly after an unusually hard day's  duties in the kitchen, there came a hasty knock at my door.    \"Let me in quick Mrs. Sullivan, the warehouse, we fear, is going. We  must come in here. We will bring some more of our things,\" and little  sister dropped the armful of clothing she carried and ran back for more.    Sure enough, as I looked, the water surged up under the warehouse to the  foot of the steps. When she returned with another load I offered to  dress and assist them, but she said they would only bring the clothing  and bedding, and I better go back to bed.    Breathlessly the sisters worked for a time, until the tide prevented  them from again entering the warehouse, and they made their bed near me  on the floor. When, after watching the waters, they felt satisfied that  they receded, they retired, weary and troubled, hoping that before  another high tide the storm would have subsided and the danger would be  past.    By September twelfth the surf was the worst we had ever seen it, and  Snake River had overflowed its banks. Most of those on the Sandspit were  obliged to flee for their lives. Hundreds were homeless on the streets.  The town's whole water-front was washed away. Tents not only went down  by hundreds, but buildings of every description were swept away and  flung by the angry surf high up on the sands.    Anchored lighters and barges were loosened from their moorings and came  ashore, as did schooners broken and disabled. Dead bodies were each day  picked up on the beach, which was strewn with wreckage.    One dark night, when the rain had ceased for a time to give place to a  fearful gale which tossed the maddened waters higher and higher, there  appeared upon the horizon a dim, portentous shape. At first it was only  a form, indistinct and uncertain. As we watched longer, it gradually  assumed the semblance of a ship. Keen eyes soon discerned a huge, black  hulk, of monstrous size when riding the crest of the breakers, smaller  and partially lost to sight when buried at intervals in the trough of  the sea.    A ship was drifting helplessly, entirely at the mercy of the elements,  and must soon be cast upon the beach at our feet. Approaching swiftly as  she was, in the heavy sea, as the violence of the wind bore her onward,  lights appeared as signals of distress, telling of souls on board in  fearful danger.    In dismay we watched the helpless, on-coming vessel. We were in direct  line of her path as she was now drifting. If by chance the mountain of  water should, by an awful upheaval, rear the wreck upon its crest at  landing, we would be engulfed in a moment of time. No power could save  the buildings which would be instantly shivered to heaps of floating  debris.    Should we flee for our lives? Or would the wind, quickly, by some  miracle, change its course, and thereby send the menacing vessel to one  side of us or the other? Groups of patrolmen and soldiers everywhere  watched with anxious eyes, and friends stood with us to encourage and  assist if needed.    God alone could avert the awful, impending disaster. He could do so, and  did.    When only a few hundred feet from shore, the huge black mass, rearing  and tossing like a thing of life in the raging sea, swerved to the west  by a sudden veer of the wind, and then, amid the roar of breakers angry  to ferocity, she, with a boom as of cannon in battle, plunged into the  sands of the beach only a hundred and fifty feet away.    The earth trembled. With one long, quivering motion, like some dumb  brute in its death struggle, the ship settled, its great timbers parting  as it did so, and the floods pouring clean over its decks. Then began  the work of rescuing those on board, which was finally, after many  hours, successfully accomplished.          CHAPTER XII.    BAR-ROOM DISTURBANCES.      \"Girls, O girls!\" shouted Mary from the kitchen door in order to be  heard above the waters, \"Do come inside!\" Then, as we answered her call  and closed the door behind us, she said: \"The danger is over now, and  you can't help those poor people in the wreck. There are plenty of men  to do that. See! it is nearly midnight, and we shall have another hard  day's work tomorrow. Go to bed like good children, do.\"    \"How about yourself, ma?\" said Ricka, carrying out the farce of mother  and children as we often did, Mary being the eldest of the four.    \"I'm going too, as soon as I get this pancake batter made, for I'm dead  tired. We will hear the particulars of the wreck at breakfast,\" replied  Mary.    \"Poor things! How I pity them. What an awful experience for women if  there were any on board,\" said sympathetic Ricka, and I left them  talking it over, to roll into my cot, weary from twelve hours of hard  work and excitement.    No anxiety, and no thundering of the breakers could now keep me awake,  and for hours I slept heavily.    Suddenly I was wide awake. No dream or unusual sound had roused me. Some  new danger must be impending. My pulses throbbed. The clock at the head  of my cot ticked regularly, and its hands pointed to four. The sisters  slept peacefully side by side. The whole town seemed resting after the  intense and continued anxiety caused by the storm, and I wondered why I  had wakened.    However, something impelled me to get up, and, rising quietly from my  cot in order not to arouse the others, I went to the south window and  peered out.    My heart fairly stood still.    The waters were upon us! They had already covered the lower steps at the  door not six feet from the cot on which I had slept. I stood motionless.  If I knew that the waters were receding, I would go quietly to bed,  allowing the others to sleep an hour longer; but if they were rising  there was no time to lose. None could reckon on the tides now, for all  previous records had been recently broken. I would wait and watch a few  minutes, I decided, and I wrapped a blanket around me, for my teeth  chattered, and I shivered.    How cruel the water looked as I watched it creep closer and closer. How  quietly now it swept at flood tide up through the piles under the  warehouse, covering the little back yard and the kitchen steps of the  restaurant. With the cunning of a thief it was creeping upon us in the  darkness when we were asleep and helpless.    Would the resistless waters persist in our destruction? Where should we  go in the storm if obliged to fly for our lives?    Twenty minutes passed.    Another step was covered while I watched--the tide was rising.    Crossing the room now to where my friends lay sleeping, I touched little  sister upon the shoulder.    \"Wake up! Wake up! The tide is coming,--the water is almost at the door!  I have been watching it for twenty minutes, and I'm sure we ought to be  dressed,\" said I, trying to keep my voice steady so as neither to betray  my fright nor startle them unnecessarily.    Springing from their bed they hurried to the window and looked out.    \"I should say so!\" exclaimed the younger lady in dismay.    \"These treacherous waters will not give us up. They want us, and all we  possess, and are literally pursuing us, I believe,\" groaned Miss S., the  older sister, struggling to get hastily into her clothing. \"But we must  waken the girls,\" she said, rapping on the intervening wall, and calling  loudly for the three other women who still slept soundly from fatigue.    With that, we all dressed, and began to pack our belongings; I putting  my rubber blanket upon the floor and rolling my bedding in that.

In Darwin's  genetic scheme the hereditary transmission of parental experience and  its consequences played a considerable role. Exactly how great that  role was supposed to be, he with his habitual caution refrained from  specifying, for the sufficient reason that he did not know.  Nevertheless much of the process of Evolution, especially that by  which organs have become degenerate and rudimentary, was certainly  attributed by Darwin to such inheritance, though since belief in the  inheritance of acquired characters fell into dispute, the fact has  been a good deal overlooked. The _Origin_ without \"use and disuse\"  would be a materially different book. A certain vacillation is  discernible in Darwin's utterances on this question, and the fact gave  to the astute Butler an opportunity for his most telling attack. The  discussion which best illustrates the genetic views of the period  arose in regard to the production of the rudimentary condition of the  wings of many beetles in the Madeira group of islands, and by  comparing passages from the _Origin_[64] Butler convicts Darwin of  saying first that this condition was in the main the result of  Selection, with disuse aiding, and in another place that the main  cause of degeneration was disuse, but that Selection had aided. To  Darwin however I think the point would have seemed one of dialetics  merely. To him the one paramount purpose was to show that somehow an  Evolution by means of Variation and Heredity might have brought about  the facts observed, and whether they had come to pass in the one way  or the other was a matter of subordinate concern.    To us moderns the question at issue has a diminished significance. For  over all such debates a change has been brought by Weismann's  challenge for evidence that use and disuse have any transmitted  effects at all. Hitherto the transmission of many acquired  characteristics had seemed to most naturalists so obvious as not to  call for demonstration.[65] Weismann's demand for facts in support of  the main proposition revealed at once that none having real cogency  could be produced. The time-honoured examples were easily shown to be  capable of different explanations. A few certainly remain which cannot  be so summarily dismissed, but--though it is manifestly impossible  here to do justice to such a subject--I think no one will dispute that  these residual and doubtful phenomena, whatever be their true nature,  are not of a kind to help us much in the interpretation of any of  those complex cases of adaptation which on the hypothesis of unguided  Natural Selection are especially difficult to understand. Use and  disuse were invoked expressly to help us over these hard places; but  whatever changes can be induced in offspring by direct treatment of  the parents, they are not of a kind to encourage hope of real  assistance from that quarter. It is not to be denied that through the  collapse of this second line of argument the Selection hypothesis has  had to take an increased and perilous burden. Various ways of meeting  the difficulty have been proposed, but these mostly resolve themselves  into improbable attempts to expand or magnify the powers of Natural  Selection.    Weismann's interpellation, though negative in purpose, has had a  lasting and beneficial effect, for through his thorough demolition of  the old loose and distracting notions of inherited experience, the  ground has been cleared for the construction of a true knowledge of  heredity based on experimental fact.    In another way he made a contribution of a more positive character,  for his elaborate speculations as to the genetic meaning of  cytological appearances have led to a minute investigation of the  visible phenomena occurring in those cell-divisions by which  germ-cells arise. Though the particular views he advocated have very  largely proved incompatible with the observed facts of heredity, yet  we must acknowledge that it was chiefly through the stimulus of  Weismann's ideas that those advances in cytology were made; and though  the doctrine of the continuity of germ-plasm cannot be maintained in  the form originally propounded, it is in the main true and  illuminating.[66] Nevertheless in the present state of knowledge we  are still as a rule quite unable to connect cytological appearances  with any genetic consequences and save in one respect (obviously of  extreme importance--to be spoken of later) the two sets of phenomena  might, for all we can see, be entirely distinct.    I cannot avoid attaching importance to this want of connection between  the nuclear phenomena and the features of bodily organisation. All  attempts to investigate Heredity by cytological means lie under the  disadvantage that it is the nuclear changes which can alone be  effectively observed. Important as they must surely be, I have never  been persuaded that the rest of the cell counts for nothing. What we  know of the behaviour and variability of chromosomes seems in my  opinion quite incompatible with the belief that they alone govern  form, and are the sole agents responsible in heredity.[67]    If, then, progress was to be made in Genetics, work of a different  kind was required. To learn the laws of Heredity and Variation there  is no other way than that which Darwin himself followed, the direct  examination of the phenomena. A beginning could be made by collecting  fortuitous observations of this class, which have often thrown a  suggestive light, but such evidence can be at best but superficial and  some more penetrating instrument of research is required. This can  only be provided by actual experiments in breeding.    The truth of these general considerations was becoming gradually clear  to many of us when in 1900 Mendel's work was rediscovered.  Segregation, a phenomenon of the utmost novelty, was thus revealed.  From that moment not only in the problem of the origin of species, but  in all the great problems of biology a new era began. So unexpected  was the discovery that many naturalists were convinced it was untrue,  and at once proclaimed Mendel's conclusions as either altogether  mistaken, or if true, of very limited application. Many fantastic  notions about the workings of Heredity had been asserted as general  principles before: this was probably only another fancy of the same  class.    Nevertheless those who had a preliminary acquaintance with the facts  of Variation were not wholly unprepared for some such revelation. The  essential deduction from the discovery of segregation was that the  characters of living things are dependent on the presence of definite  elements or factors, which are treated as units in the processes of  Heredity. These factors can thus be recombined in various ways. They  act sometimes separately, and sometimes they interact in conduction  with each other, producing their various effects. All this indicates a  definiteness and specific order in heredity, and therefore in  variation. This order cannot by the nature of the case be dependent on  Natural Selection for its existence, but must be a consequence of the  fundamental chemical and physical nature of living things. The study  of Variation had from the first shown that an orderliness of this kind  was present. The bodies and the properties of livings things are  cosmic, not chaotic. No matter how low in the scale we go, never do we  find the slightest hint of a diminution in that all-pervading  orderliness, nor can we conceive an organism existing for a moment in  any other state. Moreover not only does this order prevail in normal  forms, but again and again it is to be seen in newly-sprung varieties,  which by general consent cannot have been subjected to a prolonged  Selection. The discovery of Mendelian elements admirably coincided  with and at once gave a rationale of these facts. Genetic Variation is  then primarily the consequence of additions to, or omissions from, the  stock of elements which the species contains. The further  investigation of the species-problem must thus proceed by the  analytical method which breeding experiments provide.    In the nine years which have elapsed since Mendel's clue became  generally known, progress has been rapid. We now understand the  process by which a polymorphic race maintains its polymorphism. When a  family consists of dissimilar members, given the numerical proportions  in which these members are occurring, we can represent their  composition symbolically and state what types can be transmitted by  the various members. The difficulty of the \"swamping effects of  inter-crossing\" is practically at an end. Even the famous puzzle of  sex-limited inheritance is solved, at all events in its more regular  manifestations, and we know now how it is brought about that the  normal sisters of a colour-blind man can transmit the colour-blindness  while his normal brothers cannot transmit it.    We are still only on the fringe of the inquiry. It can be seen  extending and ramifying in many directions. To enumerate these here  would be impossible. A whole new range of possibilities is being  brought into view by study of the inter-relations between the simple  factors. By following up the evidence as to segregation, indications  have been obtained which can only be interpreted as meaning that when  many factors are being simultaneously redistributed among the  germ-cells, certain of them exert what must be described as a  repulsion upon other factors. We cannot surmise whither this discovery  may lead.    In the new light all the old problems wear a fresh aspect. Upon the  question of the nature of Sex, for example, the bearing of Mendelian  evidence is close. Elsewhere I have shown that from several sets of  parallel experiments the conclusion is almost forced upon us that, in  the types investigated, of the two sexes the female is to be regarded  as heterozygous in sex,"]]]
