Sir William Ramsay, however, discovered it to be also a terrestrial  element in 1895, and since then it has come into much prominence as one  of the products given off by radium.    Taking into consideration the excessive force of gravity on the sun, one  would expect to find the chromosphere and reversing layer growing  gradually thicker in the direction of the photosphere. This, however, is  not the case. Both these layers are strangely enough of the same  densities all through; which makes it suspected that, in these regions,  the force of gravity may be counteracted by some other force or forces,  exerting a powerful pressure outwards from the sun.      IV. THE PROMINENCES.    We have already seen, in dealing with total eclipses, that the exterior  surface of the chromosphere is agitated like a stormy sea, and from it  billows of flame are tossed up to gigantic heights. These flaming jets  are known under the name of prominences, because they were first noticed  in the form of brilliant points projecting from behind the rim of the  moon when the sun was totally eclipsed. Prominences are of two kinds,  _eruptive_ and _quiescent_. The eruptive prominences spurt up directly  from the chromosphere with immense speeds, and change their shape with  great rapidity. Quiescent prominences, on the other hand, have a form  somewhat like trees, and alter their shape but slowly. In the eruptive  prominences glowing masses of gas are shot up to altitudes sometimes as  high as 300,000 miles,[10] with velocities even so great as from 500 to  600 miles a second. It has been noticed that the eruptive prominences  are mostly found in those portions of the sun where spots usually  appear, namely, in the regions near the solar equator. The quiescent  prominences, on the other hand, are confined, as a rule, to the  neighbourhood of the sun's poles.    Prominences were at first never visible except during total eclipses of  the sun. But in the year 1868, as we have already seen, a method of  employing the spectroscope was devised, by means of which they could be  observed and studied at any time, without the necessity of waiting for  an eclipse.    A still further development of the spectroscope, the  _Spectroheliograph_, an instrument invented almost simultaneously by  Professor Hale and the French astronomer, M. Deslandres, permits of  photographs being taken of the sun, with the light emanating from _only  one_ of its glowing gases at a time. For instance, we can thus obtain a  record of what the glowing hydrogen alone is doing on the solar body at  any particular moment. With this instrument it is also possible to  obtain a series of photographs, showing what is taking place upon the  sun at various levels. This is very useful in connection with the study  of the spots; for we are, in consequence, enabled to gather more  evidence on the subject of their actual form than is given us by their  highly foreshortened appearances when observed directly in the  telescope.      V. CORONA. (Latin, _a Crown_.)    This marvellous halo of pearly-white light, which displays itself to our  view only during the total phase of an eclipse of the sun, is by no  means a layer like those other envelopments of the sun of which we have  just been treating. It appears, on the other hand, to be composed of  filmy matter, radiating outwards in every direction, and fading away  gradually into space. Its structure is noted to bear a strong  resemblance to the tails of comets, or the streamers of the aurora  borealis.    Our knowledge concerning the corona has, however, advanced very slowly.  We have not, so far, been as fortunate with regard to it as with regard  to the prominences; and, for all we can gather concerning it, we are  still entirely dependent upon the changes and chances of total solar  eclipses. All attempts, in fact, to apply the spectroscopic method, so  as to observe the corona at leisure in full sunlight in the way in which  the prominences can be observed, have up to the present met with  failure.    The general form under which the corona appears to our eyes varies  markedly at different eclipses. Sometimes its streamers are many, and  radiate all round; at other times they are confined only to the middle  portions of the sun, and are very elongated, with short feathery-looking  wisps adorning the solar poles. It is noticed that this change of shape  varies in close accordance with that 11-1/4 year period during which the  sun spots wax and wane; the many-streamered regular type corresponding  to the time of great sunspot activity, while the irregular type with the  long streamers is present only when the spots are few (see Plate VII.,  p. 142). Streamers have often been noted to issue from those regions of  the sun where active prominences are at the moment in existence; but it  cannot be laid down that this is always the case.    No hypothesis has yet been formulated which will account for the  structure of the corona, or for its variation in shape. The great  difficulty with regard to theorising upon this subject, is the fact  that we see so much of the corona under conditions of marked  foreshortening. Assuming, what indeed seems natural, that the rays of  which it is composed issue in every direction from the solar body, in a  manner which may be roughly imitated by sticking pins all over a ball;  it is plainly impossible to form any definite idea concerning streamers,  which actually may owe most of the shape they present to us, to the  mixing up of multitudes of rays at all kinds of angles to the line of  sight. In a word, we have to try and form an opinion concerning an  arrangement which, broadly speaking, is _spherical_, but which, on  account of its distance, must needs appear to us as absolutely _flat_.    The most known about the composition of the corona is that it is made up  of particles of matter, mingled with a glowing gas. It is an element in  the composition of this gas which, as has been stated, is not found to  tally with any known terrestrial element, and has, therefore, received  the name of coronium for want of a better designation.    One definite conclusion appears to be reached with regard to the corona,  _i.e._ that the matter of which it is composed, must be exceedingly  rarefied; as it is not found, for instance, to retard appreciably the  speed of comets, on occasions when these bodies pass very close to the  sun. A calculation has indeed been made which would tend to show that  the particles composing the coronal matter, are separated from each  other by a distance of perhaps between two and three yards! The density  of the corona is found not to increase inwards towards the sun. This is  what has already been noted with regard to the layers lying beneath it.  Powerful forces, acting in opposition to gravity, must hold sway here  also.    [Illustration: (A.) THE TOTAL ECLIPSE OF THE SUN OF DECEMBER 22ND, 1870    Drawn by Mr. W.H. Wesley from a photograph taken at Syracuse by Mr.  Brothers. This is the type of corona seen at the time of _greatest_  sunspot activity. The coronas of 1882 (Plate I., p. 96) and of 1905  (Frontispiece) are of the same type.    (B.) THE TOTAL ECLIPSE OF THE SUN OF MAY 28TH, 1900    Drawn by Mr. W.H. Wesley from photographs taken by Mr. E.W. Maunder.  This is the type of corona seen when the sunspots are _least_ active.  Compare the \"Ring with Wings,\" Fig. 7, p. 87.    PLATE VII. FORMS OF THE SOLAR CORONA AT THE EPOCHS OF SUNSPOT MAXIMUM  AND SUNSPOT MINIMUM, RESPECTIVELY    (Page 141)]    The 11-1/4 year period, during which the sun spots vary in number and  size, appears to govern the activities of the sun much in the same way  that our year does the changing seasonal conditions of our earth. Not  only, as we have seen, does the corona vary its shape in accordance with  the said period, but the activity of the prominences, and of the faculae,  follow suit. Further, this constant round of ebb and flow is not  confined to the sun itself, but, strangely enough, affects the earth  also. The displays of the aurora borealis, which we experience here,  coincide closely with it, as does also the varying state of the earth's  magnetism. The connection may be still better appreciated when a great  spot, or group of spots, has made its appearance upon the sun. It has,  for example, often been noted that when the solar rotation carries a  spot, or group of spots, across the middle of the visible surface of the  sun, our magnetic and electrical arrangements are disturbed for the time  being. The magnetic needles in our observatories are, for instance, seen  to oscillate violently, telegraphic communication is for a while upset,  and magnificent displays of the aurora borealis illumine our night  skies. Mr. E.W. Maunder, of Greenwich Observatory, who has made a very  careful investigation of this subject, suspects that, when elongated  coronal streamers are whirled round in our direction by the solar  rotation, powerful magnetic impulses may be projected upon us at the  moments when such streamers are pointing towards the earth.    Some interesting investigations with regard to sunspots have recently  been published by Mrs. E.W. Maunder. In an able paper, communicated to  the Royal Astronomical Society on May 10, 1907, she reviews the  Greenwich Observatory statistics dealing with the number and extent of  the spots which have appeared during the period from 1889 to 1901--a  whole sunspot cycle. From a detailed study of the dates in question, she  finds that the number of those spots which are formed on the side of the  sun turned away from us, and die out upon the side"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28613"],[0,"Pioneers of Science (#20)"],[1,"never  to teach or to believe the motion of the earth.    He quitted Rome in disgust, which before long broke out in satire. The  only way in which he could safely speak of these views now was as if  they were hypothetical and uncertain, and so we find him writing to the  Archduke Leopold, with a presentation copy of his book on the tides, the  following:--         \"This theory occurred to me when in Rome whilst the theologians       were debating on the prohibition of Copernicus's book, and of the       opinion maintained in it of the motion of the earth, which I at       that time believed: until it pleased those gentlemen to suspend the       book, and declare the opinion false and repugnant to the Holy       Scriptures. Now, as I know how well it becomes me to obey and       believe the decisions of my superiors, which proceed out of more       knowledge than the weakness of my intellect can attain to, this       theory which I send you, which is founded on the motion of the       earth, I now look upon as a fiction and a dream, and beg your       highness to receive it as such. But as poets often learn to prize       the creations of their fancy, so in like manner do I set some value       on this absurdity of mine. It is true that when I sketched this       little work I did hope that Copernicus would not, after eighty       years, be convicted of error; and I had intended to develop and       amplify it further, but a voice from heaven suddenly awakened me,       and at once annihilated all my confused and entangled fancies.\"    This sarcasm, if it had been in print, would probably have been  dangerous. It was safe in a private letter, but it shows us his real  feelings.    However, he was left comparatively quiet for a time. He was getting an  old man now, and passed the time studiously enough, partly at his house  in Florence, partly at his villa in Arcetri, a mile or so out of the  town.    Here was a convent, and in it his two daughters were nuns. One of them,  who passed under the name of Sister Maria Celeste, seems to have been a  woman of considerable capacity--certainly she was of a most affectionate  disposition--and loved and honoured her father in the most dutiful way.    This was a quiet period of his life, spoiled only by occasional fits of  illness and severe rheumatic pains, to which the old man was always  liable. Many little circumstances are known of this peaceful time. For  instance, the convent clock won't go, and Galileo mends it for them. He  is always doing little things for them, and sending presents to the Lady  Superior and his two daughters.    He was occupied now with problems in hydrostatics, and on other matters  unconnected with astronomy: a large piece of work which I must pass  over. Most interesting and acute it is, however.    In 1623, when the old Pope died, there was elected to the Papal throne,  as Urban VIII., Cardinal Barberino, a man of very considerable  enlightenment, and a personal friend of Galileo's, so that both he and  his daughters rejoice greatly, and hope that things will come all right,  and the forbidding edict be withdrawn.    The year after this election he manages to make another journey to Rome  to compliment his friend on his elevation to the Pontifical chair. He  had many talks with Urban, and made himself very agreeable.    Urban wrote to the Grand Duke Ferdinand, son of Cosmo:--         \"For We find in him not only literary distinction but also love of       piety, and he is strong in those qualities by which Pontifical good       will is easily obtainable. And now, when he has been brought to       this city to congratulate Us on Our elevation, We have very       lovingly embraced him; nor can We suffer him to return to the       country whither your liberality recalls him without an ample       provision of Pontifical love. And that you may know how dear he is       to Us, We have willed to give him this honourable testimonial of       virtue and piety. And We further signify that every benefit which       you shall confer upon him, imitating or even surpassing your       father's liberality, will conduce to Our gratification.\"    Encouraged, doubtless, by these marks of approbation, and reposing too  much confidence in the individual good will of the Pope, without heeding  the crowd of half-declared enemies who were seeking to undermine his  reputation, he set about, after his return to Florence, his greatest  literary and most popular work, _Dialogues on the Ptolemaic and  Copernican Systems_. This purports to be a series of four conversations  between three characters: Salviati, a Copernican philosopher; Sagredo, a  wit and scholar, not specially learned, but keen and critical, and who  lightens the talk with chaff; Simplicio, an Aristotelian philosopher,  who propounds the stock absurdities which served instead of arguments to  the majority of men.    The conversations are something between Plato's _Dialogues_ and Sir  Arthur Helps's _Friends in Council_. The whole is conducted with great  good temper and fairness; and, discreetly enough, no definite conclusion  is arrived at, the whole being left in abeyance as if for a fifth and  decisive dialogue, which, however, was never written, and perhaps was  only intended in case the reception was favourable.    The preface also sets forth that the object of the writer is to show  that the Roman edict forbidding the Copernican doctrine was not issued  in ignorance of the facts of the case, as had been maliciously reported,  and that he wishes to show how well and clearly it was all known  beforehand. So he says the dialogue on the Copernican side takes up the  question purely as a mathematical hypothesis or speculative figment, and  gives it every artificial advantage of which the theory is capable.    This piece of caution was insufficient to blind the eyes of the  Cardinals; for in it the arguments in favour of the earth's motion are  so cogent and unanswerable, and are so popularly stated, as to do more  in a few years to undermine the old system than all that he had written  and spoken before. He could not get it printed for two years after he  had written it, and then only got consent through a piece of  carelessness or laziness on the part of the ecclesiastical censor  through whose hands the manuscript passed--for which he was afterwards  dismissed.    However, it did appear, and was eagerly read; the more, perhaps, as the  Church at once sought to suppress it.    The Aristotelians were furious, and represented to the Pope that he  himself was the character intended by Simplicio, the philosopher whose  opinions get alternately refuted and ridiculed by the other two, till he  is reduced to an abject state of impotence.    The idea that Galileo had thus cast ridicule upon his friend and patron  is no doubt a gratuitous and insulting libel: there is no telling  whether or not Urban believed it, but certainly his countenance changed  to Galileo henceforward, and whether overruled by his Cardinals, or  actuated by some other motive, his favour was completely withdrawn.    The infirm old man was instantly summoned to Rome. His friends pleaded  his age--he was now seventy--his ill-health, the time of year, the state  of the roads, the quarantine existing on account of the plague. It was  all of no avail, to Rome he must go, and on the 14th of February he  arrived.    [Illustration: FIG. 52.--Portrait of Galileo.]    His daughter at Arcetri was in despair; and anxiety and fastings and  penances self-inflicted on his account, dangerously reduced her health.    At Rome he was not imprisoned, but he was told to keep indoors, and show  himself as little as possible. He was allowed, however, to stay at the  house of the Tuscan Ambassador instead of in gaol.    By April he was removed to the chambers of the Inquisition, and examined  several times. Here, however, the anxiety was too much, and his health  began to give way seriously; so, before long, he was allowed to return  to the Ambassador's house; and, after application had been made, was  allowed to drive in the public garden in a half-closed carriage. Thus in  every way the Inquisition dealt with him as leniently as they could. He  was now their prisoner, and they might have cast him into their  dungeons, as many another had been cast. By whatever they were  influenced--perhaps the Pope's old friendship, perhaps his advanced age  and infirmities--he was not so cruelly used.    Still, they had their rules; he _must_ be made to recant and abjure his  heresy; and, if necessary, torture must be applied. This he knew well  enough, and his daughter knew it, and her distress may be imagined.  Moreover, it is not as if they had really been heretics, as if they  hated or despised the Church of Rome. On the contrary, they loved and  honoured the Church. They were sincere and devout worshippers, and only  on a few scientific matters did Galileo presume to differ from his  ecclesiastical superiors: his disagreement with them occasioned him real  sorrow; and his dearest hope was that they could be brought to his way  of thinking and embrace the truth.    Every time he was sent for by the Inquisition he was in danger of  torture unless he recanted. All his friends urged him repeatedly to  submit. They said resistance was hopeless and fatal. Within the memory  of men still young, Giordano Bruno had been burnt alive for a similar  heresy. This had happened while Galileo was at Padua. Venice was full of  it. And since that, only eight years ago indeed, Antonio de Dominis,  Archbishop of Salpetria, had been sentenced to the same fate: \"to be  handed over to the secular arm to be dealt with as mercifully as  possible without the shedding of blood.\" So ran the hideous formula  condemning a man to the stake. After his sentence, this unfortunate man  died in the dungeons in which he had been incarcerated six years--died  what is called a \"natural\" death; but the "]]]
