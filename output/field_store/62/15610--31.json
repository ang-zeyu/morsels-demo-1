[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26378"],[0,"The Care of Books (#20)"],[1,"   man who knows nothing about writing thinks that it is no      concern of his. Whereas to a writer the last line is as      sweet as port is to a sailor. Three fingers hold the      pen, but the whole body toils. Thanks be to God. I      Warembert wrote this book in God's name. Thanks be to      God. Amen[158].    Entreaties so gentle and so pathetic as these are seldom met with; but  curses--in the same strain probably as those to which the Council of Paris  took exception--are extremely common. In fact, in some Houses, a  manuscript invariably ended with an imprecation--more or less severe,  according to the writer's taste[159]. I will append a few specimens.        This book belongs to S. Maximin at his monastery of      Micy, which abbat Peter caused to be written, and with      his own labour corrected and punctuated, and on Holy      Thursday dedicated to God and S. Maximin on the altar of      S. Stephen, with this imprecation that he who should      take it away from thence by what device soever, with      the intention of not restoring it, should incur      damnation with the traitor Judas, with Annas, Caiaphas,      and Pilate. Amen[160].        Should anyone by craft or any device whatever abstract      this book from this place [Jumieges] may his soul      suffer, in retribution for what he has done, and may his      name be erased from the book of the living and not be      recorded among the Blessed[161].    A simpler form of imprecation occurs very frequently in manuscripts  belonging to S. Alban's:        This book belongs to S. Alban. May whosoever steals it      from him or destroys its title be anathema. Amen[162].    A similar form of words occurs at the Cistercian House of Clairvaux, a  great school of writing like S. Alban's, but whether it habitually  protected its manuscripts in this manner I am unable to say:        May whoever steals or alienates this manuscript, or      scratches out its title, be anathema. Amen[163].    A very curious form of curse occurs in one of the manuscripts of Christ  Church, Canterbury. The writer repents of his severity in the last  sentence.        May whoever destroys this title, or by gift or sale or      loan or exchange or theft or by any other device      knowingly alienates this book from the aforesaid Christ      Church, incur in this life the malediction of Jesus      Christ and of the most glorious Virgin His Mother, and      of Blessed Thomas, Martyr. Should however it please      Christ, who is patron of Christ Church, may his soul be      saved in the Day of Judgment[164].    Lastly, I will quote a specimen in verse, from a breviary now in the  library of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge:      Wher so ever y be come over all    I belonge to the Chapell of gunvylle hall:    He shal be cursed by the grate sentens    That felonsly faryth and berith me thens.    And whether he bere me in pooke or sekke,    For me he shall be hanged by the nekke,    (I am so well beknown of dyverse men)    But I be restored theder agen[165].    On the other hand, the gift of books to a monastery was gratefully  recorded and enumerated among the good deeds of their donors. Among the  Augustinians such gifts, and the labour expended upon books in general,  was the subject of a special service[166].    It is not uncommon to find a monastic library regularly endowed with part  of the annual revenue of the House. For instance, at Corbie, the librarian  received 10 sous from each of the higher, and 5 sous from each of the  inferior officers, together with a certain number of bushels of corn from  lands specially set apart for the purpose. This was confirmed by a bull of  Pope Alexander III. (1166-1179)[167]. A similar arrangement was made at  the library of S. Martin des Champs, Paris, in 1261[168]. At the  Benedictine Abbey of Fleury, near Orleans, in 1146, it was agreed in  chapter on the proposition of the abbat, that in each year on S.  Benedict's winter festival (21 March), he and the priors subordinate to  him, together with the officers of the House, should all contribute \"to  the repair of our books, the preparation of new ones, and the purchase of  parchment.\" The name of each contributor, and the sum that he was to give,  are recorded[169]. At the Benedictine Monastery of Ely Bishop Nigel  (1133-1174) granted the tithe of certain churches in the diocese \"as a  perpetual alms to the _scriptorium_ of the church of Ely for the purpose  of making and repairing the books of the said church[170].\" The books  referred to were probably, in the first instance, service-books; but the  number required of these could hardly have been sufficient to occupy the  whole time of the scribes, and the library would doubtless derive benefit  from their labours. The _scriptorium_ at S. Alban's was also specially  endowed.    We must next consider the answer to the following questions: In what part  of their Houses did the Monastic Orders bestow their books? and what  pieces of furniture did they use? The answer to the first of these  questions is a very curious one, when we consider what our climate is, and  indeed what the climate of the whole of Europe is, during the winter  months. The centre of the monastic life was the cloister. Brethren were  not allowed to congregate in any other part of the conventual buildings,  except when they went into the frater, or dining-hall, for their meals, or  at certain hours in certain seasons into the warming-house  (_calefactorium_). In the cloister accordingly they kept their books; and  there they wrote and studied, or conducted the schooling of the novices  and choir-boys, in winter and in summer alike.    It is obvious that their work must have been at the mercy of the elements  during many months of the year, and some important proofs that such was  the case can be quoted. Cuthbert, Abbat of Wearmouth and Jarrow in the  second half of the eighth century, excuses himself to a correspondent for  not having sent him all the works of Bede which he had asked for, on the  ground that the intense cold of the previous winter had paralysed the  hands of his scribes[171]; Ordericus Vitalis, who wrote in the first half  of the twelfth century, closes the fourth book of his Ecclesiastical  History with a lament that he must lay aside his work for the winter[172];  and a monk of Ramsey Abbey in Huntingdonshire has recorded his  discomforts in a Latin couplet which seems to imply that in a place so  inconvenient as a cloister all seasons were equally destructive of serious  work:      In vento minime pluvia nive sole sedere    Possumus in claustro nec scribere neque studere[173].      As we sit here in tempest in rain snow and sun    Nor writing nor reading in cloister is done.    But, when circumstances were more propitious, plenty of good work that was  of permanent value could be done in a cloister. A charming picture has  come down to us of the literary activity that prevailed in the Abbey of S.  Martin at Tournai at the end of the eleventh century, when Abbat Odo was  giving an impulse to the writing of MSS. \"When you entered the cloister,\"  says his chronicler, \"you could generally see a dozen young monks seated  on chairs, and silently writing at desks of careful and artistic design.  With their help, he got accurate copies made of all Jerome's commentaries  on the Prophets, of the works of Blessed Gregory, and of all the treatises  he could find of Augustine, Ambrose, Isidore, and Anselm; so that the like  of his library was not to be found in any of the neighbouring churches;  and those attached to them used generally to ask for our copies for the  correction of their own[174].\"    The second question cannot be answered so readily. We must begin by  examining, in some detail, the expressions used to denote furniture in the  various documents that deal with conventual libraries.    S. Pachomius places his books in a cupboard (_fenestra_); S. Benedict uses  only the general term, library (_bibliotheca_), which may mean either a  room or a piece of furniture; and the word press (_armarium_), with which  we become so familiar afterwards, does not make its appearance till near  the end of the eleventh century. Lanfranc does not use it, but as I have  shewn that he based his statutes, at least to some extent, on the Cluniac  Customs, and as they identify the library (_bibliotheca_) with the press  (_armarium_), and call the librarian, termed by Lanfranc the keeper of the  books, the keeper of the press (_armarius_), we may safely assume that the  books to which Lanfranc refers were housed in a similar piece of  furniture. Moreover, in Benedictine houses of later date, as for instance  at Abingdon and Evesham, the word is constantly employed.    I pointed out in the first chapter that the word press (_armarium_) was  used by the Romans to signify both a detached piece of furniture and a  recess in a wall into which such a contrivance might be inserted[175]. The  same use obtained in medieval times[176], and the passage quoted above  from the Augustinian customs[177] shews that the book-press there  contemplated was a recess lined with wood and subdivided so as to keep the  books separate.    The books to be accommodated in a monastery, even of large size, could not  at its origin have been numerous[178], and would easily have been  contained in a single receptacle. This, I conceive, was that recess in the  wall which is so frequently found between the Chapter-House and the door  into the church at the end of the east pane of the cloister. In many  monastic ruins this recess is still open, and, by a slight effort of  imagination, can be restored to its pristine use. Elsewhere it is filled  in, having been abandoned by the monks themselves in favour of a fresh  contrivance. The recess I am speaking of was called the common press  (_armarium commune_), or common cloister-press (_commune armarium  claustri_); and it contained the books"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26393"],[0,"The Medicinal Plants of the Philippines (#20)"],[1,"previously  washed with the decoction.    The tree exudes an abundant gum very similar to gum arabic which  latter is the product of another species of acacia (_A. Arabica_,  Willd.). The Manila pharmacist, D. Anacleto del Rosario, sent to  the Paris Exposition of 1899 a specimen of this gum obtained on the  plantation of D. P. P. Roxas, in Batangas. This specimen differed in  no respect from gum arabic and it will surely sooner or later take  the place of the latter in the Philippines, both for pharmaceutical  and industrial purposes. It would be superfluous to describe here  the properties of gum arabic.    Botanical Description.--A small tree 9-12° high, very well known, trunk  bristling with long thorns. Leaves twice abruptly pinnate. One or more  pairs of leaflets, very small, linear. Common petiole with two thorns  united at its base and a small glandule on the upper part. Flowers  yellow, aromatic, axillary, joined in a globose head 1/2-3/4' in  diameter, consisting of more than 50 minute flowerets. In each axil  are 2 peduncles. In some heads all the flowerets are staminate, in  others hermaphrodite. The hermaphrodite flowers have a calyx with  5 small teeth. Corolla, 5 petals. Stamens 40 or more. Pistil same  length as the stamens. Staminate flowers: calyx, corolla, stamens  and anthers as in the hermaphrodite flowers. Pistil none. Pod round,  curved, with 8 or more elliptical, compressed seeds.    Habitat.--Grows everywhere, but forms dense thickets in the provinces  of La Laguna and Batangas. Blooms in January.          CRASSULACEÆ.    Orpine Family.        _Kalanchoe laciniata_, DC. (_Cotyledon laciniata_, Roxb.; _Bryophyllum  serratum_, Blanco.)    Nom. Vulg.--_Siempreviva_ (_Live-for-ever_), Sp.-Fil.; _Katakataka_,  Tag.    Uses.--The fleshy leaves are beaten up and applied to chronic ulcers  and sores on which they exert a stimulant action. Applied to the  temples they relieve headache. Ainslie testifies to the good effect  of its local use in inflammations and as a wash for ulcers. The juice  of the leaves is used in Concan in the treatment of bilious diarrhoea  and gall stones.    Botanical Description.--A well-known plant, about 2° high, with leaves  sessile, opposite, oval, serrately toothed, fleshy. Flowers yellow,  in umbels, the stalks reaching a height of 3°. Calyx very short,  with 4 lanceolate, acuminate sepals, united at the base. Corolla  salver-shaped, persistent, with border having 4 small lobules. Stamens  8, fertile. Ovaries 4, free, each with 1 many-ovuled cell. Styles  same length as the stamens. Stigmas awl-shaped. Four seed vessels,  each with 1 compartment containing many oblong seeds.    Habitat.--Common in all parts of the islands.          COMBRETACEÆ.        _Terminalia Catappa_, L. (_T. molucana_, Lam.; _T. mauriciana_,  Blanco.)    Nom. Vulg.--_Talisay_, Tag.; _Almendro_, Sp.-Fil.; _Talisay_,  _Banilak_, _Nato_, _Hitam_, Vis.; _Kalisay_, Pam.; _Lugo_, _Pandan_,  Iloc.; _Indian Almond_, Indo-Eng.    Uses.--The kernel is edible and has a very agreeable taste. It yields  about 50% of a fixed oil, sweet and savory. If left for some time,  it deposits an abundance of stearin. It closely resembles oil of sweet  almonds for which it, as well as the oil of Pili (_Canarium commune_,  L.), which we have already described, makes a good substitute.    The trunk bark is astringent and in decoction is used for atonic  diarrhoea and as a lotion for ulcers.    Decoction.--              Bark (ground and pounded)    12 grams.          Water                       150 grams.          Simple syrup                 40 grams.      To be given by the tablespoonful in 24 hours.    Botanical Description.--A tree, 6-8 m. high. Branches horizontal  and radiating from the trunk. Leaves purplish, bunched, cleft at  the base, sometimes transversely ovate, sometimes oval, notched,  glabrous. Petiole very short. Flowers axillary, racemose, with a scale  at the base of the peduncle, some hermaphrodite and others lacking  pistils. Staminate flowers: calyx downy within, with 5 lobes. Corolla  wanting. Stamens 10, inserted on the calyx. Hermaphrodite flowers:  pistil same length as stamens. Drupe, fleshy, inferior, oval with  the borders turned upward containing a very hard and fibrous nut;  seed long and sharp-pointed.    Habitat.--Common in Luzon. In Manila it is cultivated extensively as  an ornamental tree, especially along the Sabana Walk, General Solano  Ave. and in Sampaloc and Malacañan.        _Terminalia Chebula_, Retz. (_T. reticulata_, Toth.; _Bucida cuminata_,  Blanco.)    Nom. Vulg.--_Dinglas_, _Diglas_, Tag.; _Black Myrobalan Tree_,  Indo-Eng.    Uses.--The ripe fruit, called _myrobalans_ in India, is purgative  and six of them pounded up and given in decoction operate with  certainty, producing 4 or 5 copious evacuations without nausea or  other disagreeable symptoms. Dr. Waring has experimented with them  and recommends them highly. The taste may be made more agreeable  by adding a little cinnamon to the decoction. Dymock states that  three fruits are sufficient, and Dr. Hove gives one as the effective  dose. This lack of agreement may be explained by the fact that the  fruits are of different sizes, and probably Waring refers to those  of medium size. Contrary to what one would imagine, judging from  its purgative action, the fruit contains astringent principles, and  makes an effective injection for leucorrhoea as a substitute for nut  galls. It is also of some merit in the treatment of piles.    The green fruit is highly esteemed by Radja Kalikesen as a carminative,  tonic and purgative. Dr. Twining also mentions these same properties,  recommends it as a tonic and aperient of great benefit in atony of  the digestive organs and expresses surprise that the Europeans make  no use of it. According to the same author a dose in the treatment  of diarrhoea and dysentery is 4 grams twice a day. He quotes a case  of hypertrophy of the spleen which he cured with this fruit.    Some of the leaves bear horn-shaped galls, flattened, narrow and  hollow. They are caused by an insect which stings the leaves and  deposits its eggs in them. These leaves with galls are astringent and  very useful and effective in dysentery and diarrhoea, especially that  of children. The dose for a child of more than one year is 0.40 to 0.50  gram a day, administered in fractional doses every two or three hours.    Fridolin has obtained from its fruit an acid, which he calls  _chebulinic_ (C_28_H_25_O_10_) and presumes to be a mixture of tannic  and gallic acids. As Stenhouse had formerly indicated, no principle has  been discovered to which the purgative properties can be attributed,  unless it be a green oleo-resin turned red by nitric acid, obtained  from the fruit by Apery.    Botanical Description.--A tree of the second order, with leaves  3' long, alternate, lanceolate, entire and glabrous. Petioles  short. Flowers terminal, in spiked panicles. Calyx superior,  bell-shaped, colored, downy within, 5-toothed. Corolla wanting. Stamens  10, longer than the calyx. Anthers roundish. Ovary cylindrical. Style  curved and longer than the stamens. Stigma simple. Fruit ovoid, 2-4  centimeters long, 5-10 acute angles, wrinkled, with blackish, hard,  compact mesocarp; contains 1 seed.    Habitat.--Batangas, San Mateo. Blooms in May.        _Quisqualis Indica_, L. (_Q. villosa_, Roxb.; _Q. spinosa_, Nares.)    Nom. Vulg.--_Tagaraw_, _Niogniogan_, Tag.; _Tangolon_, Vis.;  _Babebabe_, Pam.; _Tartaraw_, Iloc.    Uses.--The fruit contains a kernel that tastes much like cacao, for  which reason the Tagalogs call it \"niogniogan\" (like cacao). This  kernel is a powerful anthelmintic, used also in India, the dose for  a child of 4 years being 2-4, pulverized and mixed with a little  molasses or sugar. A large dose produces hiccough, a fact well known  to the natives. Dr. Bouton states that they may cause convulsions  and other similar nervous disorders.    They yield a light green, fixed oil, probably the active principle  of the plant.    Botanical Description.--A climbing shrub, 6-9° high, whose stem is  thickly set with long, opposite thorns. Leaves in stars of 3, oblong,  acute, entire, glabrous. Petioles very short. Flowers white, veined  with red, in axillary spikes. Calyx very long, nearly cylindrical,  5-toothed. Corolla, 5 petals, inserted between the teeth of the  calyx. Stamens 10, inserted on the calyx-tube, shorter than the  corolla, arranged in 2 series, 5 higher than the rest. Style the same  length as the stamens, united throughout nearly its entire length  with the wall of the calyx-tube from which it separates near the  stigma. Stigma rather bulky. Fruit 1' long, ovoid, 5 sharp ridges  in the woody, fragile, mahogany-colored pericarp, which contains a  pointed kernel at one end.    Habitat.--San Mateo, and along the shores of Luzon. Blooms in May.          MYRTACEÆ.    Myrtle Family.        _Psidium pomiferum_, L. (_P. aromaticum_ and _P. pyriferum_, Blanco.)    Nom. Vulg.--_Guayabas_, Sp.; _Bayabas_, _Guayabas_, _Tayabas_, Tag.,  and other dialects; _Guava_, Eng.    Uses.--The green fruit is acid and very astringent. The stage of  development when it is best eaten raw, is just before it ripens, for  then its acidity has lessened, it is not astringent and does not emit  the strong odor, so disagreeable to many, that characterizes the ripe  fruit. When fully ripe it is sweet, non-astringent and very bland,  and this is the stage when it is best for making the jellies and  preserves so popular in the Philippines.    The bark, especially that of the root, is highly astringent  and a decoction of it is used for diarrhoea and as a wash for  ulcers. Dr. Waitz has successfully used the following formula in  treating the chronic diarrhoea of children:                  Root bark of guava      15 grams.              Water                  180 grams.      Boil till reduced one half. Dose, a tablespoonful every 2 or 3"]]]
