Thus,  to shew the distinction, the statute 13 Eliz. c. 10. to prevent  spiritual persons from making leases for longer terms than twenty one  years, or three lives, is a public act; it being a rule prescribed to  the whole body of spiritual persons in the nation: but an act to  enable the bishop of Chester to make a lease to A.B. for sixty years,  is an exception to this rule; it concerns only the parties and the  bishop's successors; and is therefore a private act.    [Footnote d: Gravin. _Orig._ 1. Sec. 24.]    STATUTES also are either _declaratory_ of the common law, or  _remedial_ of some defects therein. Declaratory, where the old custom  of the kingdom is almost fallen into disuse, or become disputable; in  which case the parliament has thought proper, _in perpetuum rei  testimonium_, and for avoiding all doubts and difficulties, to declare  what the common law is and ever hath been. Thus the statute of  treasons, 25 Edw. III. cap. 2. doth not make any new species of  treasons; but only, for the benefit of the subject, declares and  enumerates those several kinds of offence, which before were treason  at the common law. Remedial statutes are those which are made to  supply such defects, and abridge such superfluities, in the common  law, as arise either from the general imperfection of all human laws,  from change of time and circumstances, from the mistakes and unadvised  determinations of unlearned judges, or from any other cause  whatsoever. And, this being done either by enlarging the common law  where it was too narrow and circumscribed, or by restraining it where  it was too lax and luxuriant, this has occasioned another subordinate  division of remedial acts of parliament into _enlarging_ and  _restraining_ statutes. To instance again in the case of treason.  Clipping the current coin of the kingdom was an offence not  sufficiently guarded against by the common law: therefore it was  thought expedient by statute 5 Eliz. c. 11. to make it high treason,  which it was not at the common law: so that this was an _enlarging_  statute. At common law also spiritual corporations might lease out  their estates for any term of years, till prevented by the statute 13  Eliz. beforementioned: this was therefore a _restraining_ statute.    SECONDLY, the rules to be observed with regard to the construction of  statutes are principally these which follow.    1. THERE are three points to be considered in the construction of all  remedial statutes; the old law, the mischief, and the remedy: that is,  how the common law stood at the making of the act; what the mischief  was, for which the common law did not provide; and what remedy the  parliament hath provided to cure this mischief. And it is the business  of the judges so to construe the act, as to suppress the mischief and  advance the remedy[e]. Let us instance again in the same restraining  statute of the 13 Eliz. By the common law ecclesiastical corporations  might let as long leases as they thought proper: the mischief was,  that they let long and unreasonable leases, to the impoverishment of  their successors: the remedy applied by the statute was by making void  all leases by ecclesiastical bodies for longer terms than three lives  or twenty one years. Now in the construction of this statute it is  held, that leases, though for a longer term, if made by a bishop, are  not void during the bishop's life; or, if made by a dean with  concurrence of his chapter, they are not void during the life of the  dean: for the act was made for the benefit and protection of the  successor[f]. The mischief is therefore sufficiently suppressed by  vacating them after the death of the grantor; but the leases, during  their lives, being not within the mischief, are not within the remedy.    [Footnote e: 3 Rep. 7 _b._ Co. Litt. 11 _b._ 42.]    [Footnote f: Co. Litt. 45. 3 Rep. 60.]    2. A STATUTE, which treats of things or persons of an inferior rank,  cannot by any _general words_ be extended to those of a superior. So a  statute, treating of \"deans, prebendaries, parsons, vicars, _and  others having spiritual promotion_,\" is held not to extend to bishops,  though they have spiritual promotion; deans being the highest persons  named, and bishops being of a still higher order[g].    [Footnote g: 2 Rep. 46.]    3. PENAL statutes must be construed strictly. Thus a statute 1 Edw.  VI. having enacted that those who are convicted of stealing _horses_  should not have the benefit of clergy, the judges conceived that this  did not extend to him that should steal but _one horse_, and therefore  procured a new act for that purpose in the following year[h]. And, to  come nearer our own times, by the statute 14 Geo. II. c. 6. stealing  sheep, _or other cattle_, was made felony without benefit of clergy.  But these general words, \"or other cattle,\" being looked upon as much  too loose to create a capital offence, the act was held to extend to  nothing but mere sheep. And therefore, in the next sessions, it was  found necessary to make another statute, 15 Geo. II. c. 34. extending  the former to bulls, cows, oxen, steers, bullocks, heifers, calves,  and lambs, by name.    [Footnote h: Bac. Elem. c. 12.]    4. STATUTES against frauds are to be liberally and beneficially  expounded. This may seem a contradiction to the last rule; most  statutes against frauds being in their consequences penal. But this  difference is here to be taken: where the statute acts upon the  offender, and inflicts a penalty, as the pillory or a fine, it is then  to be taken strictly: but when the statute acts upon the offence, by  setting aside the fraudulent transaction, here it is to be construed  liberally. Upon this footing the statute of 13 Eliz. c. 5. which  avoids all gifts of goods, &c, made to defraud creditors _and  others_, was held to extend by the general words to a gift made to  defraud the queen of a forfeiture[i].    [Footnote i: 3 Rep. 82.]    5. ONE part of a statute must be so construed by another, that the  whole may if possible stand: _ut res magis valeat, quam pereat_. As if  land be vested in the king and his heirs by act of parliament, saving  the right of A; and A has at that time a lease of it for three years:  here A shall hold it for his term of three years, and afterwards it  shall go to the king. For this interpretation furnishes matter for  every clause of the statute to work and operate upon. But    6. A SAVING, totally repugnant to the body of the act, is void. If  therefore an act of parliament vests land in the king and his heirs,  saving the right of all persons whatsoever; or vests the land of A in  the king, saving the right of A: in either of these cases the saving  is totally repugnant to the body of the statute, and (if good) would  render the statute of no effect or operation; and therefore the saving  is void, and the land vests absolutely in the king[k].    [Footnote k: 1 Rep. 47.]    7. WHERE the common law and a statute differ, the common law gives  place to the statute; and an old statute gives place to a new one. And  this upon the general principle laid down in the last section, that  \"_leges posteriores priores contrarias abrogant_.\" But this is to be  understood, only when the latter statute is couched in negative terms,  or by it's matter necessarily implies a negative. As if a former act  says, that a juror upon such a trial shall have twenty pounds a year;  and a new statute comes and says, he shall have twenty marks: here the  latter statute, though it does not express, yet necessarily implies a  negative, and virtually repeals the former. For if twenty marks be  made qualification sufficient, the former statute which requires  twenty pounds is at an end[l]. But if both acts be merely affirmative,  and the substance such that both may stand together, here the latter  does not repeal the former, but they shall both have a concurrent  efficacy. If by a former law an offence be indictable at the quarter  sessions, and a latter law makes the same offence indictable at the  assises; here the jurisdiction of the sessions is not taken away, but  both have a concurrent jurisdiction, and the offender may be  prosecuted at either; unless the new statute subjoins express negative  words, as, that the offence shall be indictable at the assises, _and  not elsewhere_[m].    [Footnote l: Jenk. Cent. 2. 73.]    [Footnote m: 11 Rep. 63.]    8. IF a statute, that repeals another, is itself repealed afterwards,  the first statute is hereby revived, without any formal words for that  purpose. So when the statutes of 26 and 35 Hen. VIII, declaring the  king to be the supreme head of the church, were repealed by a statute  1 & 2 Ph. and Mary, and this latter statute was afterwards repealed by  an act of 1 Eliz. there needed not any express words of revival in  queen Elizabeth's statute, but these acts of king Henry were impliedly  and virtually revived[n].    [Footnote n: 4 Inst. 325.]    9. ACTS of parliament derogatory from the power of subsequent  parliaments bind not. So the statute 11 Hen. VII. c. 1. which directs,  that no person for assisting a king _de facto_ shall be attainted of  treason by act of parliament or otherwise, is held to be good only as  to common prosecutions for high treason; but will not restrain or clog  any parliamentary attainder[o]. Because the legislature, being in  truth the sovereign power, is always of equal, always of absolute  authority: it acknowleges no superior upon earth, which the prior  legislature must have been, if it's ordinances could bind the present  parliament.
