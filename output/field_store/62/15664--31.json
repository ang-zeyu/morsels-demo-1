Any change in the  position of this star would break up this balance, and thus, in general,  it follows that stars must be in motion, since all of them cannot occupy  such a critical position as has to be assumed. If but one fixed star is  in motion, this affects all the rest, and we cannot doubt but that  every star, our sun included, is in motion by an amount which varies  from small to great. If the sun alone had a motion, and the other stars  were at rest, the consequence of this would be that all the fixed stars  would appear to be retreating _en masse_ from that point in the sky  towards which we were moving. Those nearest us would move more rapidly,  those more distant less so. And in the same way, the stars from which  the solar system was receding would seem to be approaching each other.  If the stars, instead of being quite at rest, as just supposed, had  motions proper to themselves, then we should have a double complexity.  They would still appear to an observer in the solar system to have  motions, and part of these motions would be truly proper to the stars,  and part would be due to the advance of the sun itself in space.    Observations can show us only the _resultant_ of these two motions.  It is for reasoning to separate this resultant into its two components.  At first the question is to determine whether the results of observation  indicate any solar motion at all. If there is none, the proper motions  of stars will be directed along all possible lines. If the sun does  truly move, then there will be a general agreement in the resultant  motions of the stars near the ends of the line along which it moves,  while those at the sides, so to speak, will show comparatively less  systematic effect. It is as if one were riding in the rear of a railway  train and watching the rails over which it has just passed. As we recede  from any point, the rails at that point seem to come nearer and nearer  together.    If we were passing through a forest, we should see the trunks of the  trees from which we were going apparently come nearer and nearer  together, while those on the sides of us would remain at their constant  distance, and those in front would grow further and further apart.    These phenomena, which occur in a case where we are sensible of our own  motion, serve to show how we may deduce a motion, otherwise unknown,  from the appearances which are presented by the stars in space.    In this way, acting upon suggestions which had been thrown out  previously to his own time by LAMBERT, MAYER, and BRADLEY, HERSCHEL  demonstrated that the sun, together with all its system, was moving  through space in an unknown and majestic orbit of its own. The centre  round which this motion is directed cannot yet be assigned. We can  only know the point in the heavens towards which our course is  directed--\"the apex of solar motion.\"    By a study of the proper motions assigned by MASKELYNE to the brighter  stars, HERSCHEL was able to define the position of the solar apex with  an astonishing degree of accuracy. His calculations have been several  times repeated with the advantage of modern analytical methods, and of  the hundred-fold material now at our disposition, but nothing essential  has been added to his results of 1805, which were based upon such scanty  data; and his paper of 1782 contains the announcement of the discovery  itself.    His second paper on the _Direction_ and _Velocity_ of the solar system  (1805) is the best example that can possibly be given of his marvellous  skill in reaching the heart of a matter, and it may be the one in which  his philosophical powers appear in their highest exercise. For sustained  reflection and high philosophic thought it is to be ranked with the  researches of NEWTON in the _Principia_.                 _Researches on the Construction of the Heavens._    HERSCHEL'S papers on the Construction of the Heavens, as he named it,  extended over his whole scientific life. By this he specially means the  method according to which the stars, the clusters, the nebulae, are  spread through the regions of space, the causes that have led to this  distribution, and the laws to which it is subjected.    No single astronomical fact is unimportant in the light which it may  throw on the scheme of the whole, and each fact is to be considered in  this light. As an instance: his discovery of the variable star  _[alpha] Herculis_, which has a period of sixty days, was valuable in  itself as adding one more to the number of those strange suns whose  light is now brighter, now fainter, in a regular and periodic order.  But the chief value of the discovery was that now we had an instance of  a periodic star which went through all its phases in sixty days, and  connected, as it were, the stars of short periods (three to seven days)  with those of very long ones (three hundred to five hundred days), which  two groups had, until then, been the only ones known. In the same way  all his researches on the parallaxes of stars were not alone for the  discovery of the distance of any one or two single stars, but to gain a  unit of celestial measure, by means of which the depths of space might  be sounded.    Astronomy in HERSCHEL'S day considered the bodies of the solar system as  separated from each other by distances, and as filling a cubical space.  The ideas of near and far, of up and down, were preserved, in regard to  them, by common astronomical terms. But the vast number of stars seemed  to be thought of, as they appear in fact to exist, lying on the surface  of a hollow sphere. The immediate followers of BRADLEY used these fixed  stars as points of reference by which the motions within the solar  system could be determined, or, like LACAILLE and LALANDE, gathered  those immense catalogues of their positions which are so indispensable  to the science. MICHELL and HERSCHEL alone, in England, occupied their  thoughts with the nature and construction of the heavens--the one in his  study, the other through observation.[34] They were concerned with all  three of the dimensions of space.    In his memoir of 1784, HERSCHEL says:        \"Hitherto the sidereal heavens have, not inadequately for the      purpose designed, been represented by the concave surface of a      sphere, in the centre of which the eye of an observer might be      supposed to be placed.        \"It is true the various magnitudes of the fixed stars even then      plainly suggested to us, and would have better suited, the idea of      an expanded firmament of three dimensions; but the observations upon      which I am now going to enter still farther illustrate and enforce      the necessity of considering the heavens in this point of view. In      future, therefore, we shall look upon those regions into which we      may now penetrate by means of such large telescopes, as a naturalist      regards a rich extent of ground or chain of mountains containing      strata variously inclined and directed, as well as consisting of      very different materials. The surface of a globe or map, therefore,      will but ill delineate the interior parts of the heavens.\"    HERSCHEL'S method of study was founded on a mode of observation which he  called _star-gauging_. It consisted in pointing a powerful telescope  toward various parts of the heavens, and ascertaining by actual count  how thick the stars were in each region. His twenty-foot reflector was  provided with such an eye-piece that, in looking into it, he saw a  portion of the heavens about 15' in diameter. A circle of this size on  the celestial sphere has about one quarter the apparent surface of the  sun, or of the full moon. On pointing the telescope in any direction, a  greater or less number of stars were visible. These were counted, and  the direction in which the telescope pointed was noted. Gauges of this  kind were made in all parts of the sky, and the results were tabulated  in the order of right ascension.    The following is an extract from the gauges, and gives the average  number of stars in each field at the points noted in right ascension and  north polar distance:      -----------------------------------------------------------------                |    N.

Such differences are still  more marked, if we compare the extreme cases found by HERSCHEL, as  R. A. = 19h 41m, N. P. D. = 74 deg. 33', number of stars per field = 588;  and R. A. = 16h 10m, N. P. D. = 113 deg. 4', number of stars = 1.1.    The number of stars in certain portions is very great. For example, in  the Milky Way, near _Orion_, six fields of view promiscuously taken gave  110, 60, 70, 90, 70, and 74 stars each, or a mean of 79 stars per field.  The most vacant space in this neighborhood gave 60 stars. So that as  HERSCHEL'S sweeps were two degrees wide in declination, in one hour  (15 deg.) there would pass through the field of his telescope 40,000 or  more stars. In some of the sweeps this number was as great as 116,000  stars in a quarter of an hour.    When HERSCHEL first applied his telescope to the Milky Way, he believed  that it completely resolved the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29070"],[0,"Brighter Britain! (Volume 1 of 2) (#20)"],[1,"we believe that we enjoy to the  utmost all the good that there is in this life of ours, and that we  measurably lessen the struggles and troubles that have to be gone  through.    And now to revert more particularly to our home life in the shanty.    The insect world is a great feature in Northern New Zealand, both as to  variety, which is extensive, and as to quantity, which is illimitable.  Within our shanty there are certain species which make themselves felt,  smelt, or otherwise apparent to our annoyance, without taking into  consideration the hosts that, as far as we are concerned, are innocuous.    St. Patrick is reported to have driven all the snakes out of Ireland;  and, according to O'Gaygun, he afterwards journeyed over here, and  performed the same service in these islands. The deed was done, says my  informant, in order that this Canaan of the South Sea might be made  ready for descendants of Hibernian kings, when the proper time should  come; and that time, he continues, was when loyal and true sons of Erin  should be seeking afar for a home, where the Land League would cease  from troubling; and the landlord be at rest!    Well, we have no snakes, thanks to St. Patrick, but if that gentleman  had only continued and completed his work, so far as to have excluded  certain insect pests as well, we could have felt more beholden to him.  We have them both out of doors and indoors, but it is with the invaders  of our sanctuary that I have at present to deal.    First, there is the mosquito. We have them here of all sorts and sizes.  Sometimes they come by twos and threes, and sometimes they come in  swarms. They are a deadly nuisance anyway, and a most obnoxious addition  to the inhabitants of our shanty. The peculiar delight of a mosquito is  to arrive just at the moment when you are falling off to sleep, properly  fatigued with your day's work. You hear a long, threatening boom, which  finally ends with a sharp jerk, like buzz-z-z-z-z-z-zup. Then you wait  in anxious expectancy for what you well know will come next. It does  come, a sharp prick on some part where you least expected it. You slap  angrily at the place, and hurt yourself, but not the mosquito. O no! he  is gone before you can satisfy your just vengeance, and he leaves a mark  of his visit that will worry you for days after.    Wise people envelope themselves in gauze mosquito-bars, but we are not  wise, and we do not. Conceive the fury of O'Gaygun at such an  innovation, such pampering, effeminacy, luxury! Who would venture to  introduce a mosquito-bar into a community of which he is member? What  might not be expected from this most conservative of pioneers? Even Old  Colonial says it is better that we should \"harden ourselves to it.\" But  occasionally, in the stilly watches of the night, I hear a hasty remark  from his corner of the shanty, which leads me to believe that, with all  the years of his mosquito experience, he is not wholly hardened yet.    Then there is the sandfly, another enemy of our peace. This creature is  not so bad as the first, though. It is true his sting is sharp, and  always draws a drop of blood, but there is no after irritation.  Sometimes, when sandflies abound about us, we make them contribute to  our amusement in moments of leisure. Bets are made, or a pool is formed,  and we stretch out our closed fists together and wait. By-and-by a  sandfly settles on the back of some one's hand, and proceeds to browse.  Once his proboscis is buried in the skin, the hand is opened, and he is  caught, for he cannot withdraw his weapon from the now contracted skin.  Then the capturer pockets the stakes, and executes the bloodsucker. Such  is one of our simple pastimes.    Another insect foe of ours is one not wholly unknown in other parts of  the world. It is the nimble flea. St. Patrick is not to blame for  leaving this reptile here. He is not indigenous. He was unknown to the  Maoris until the coming of the Pakeha; but he has naturalized himself  most thoroughly now. The \"little stranger,\" as the natives playfully  term him, is to be found in abundance in every Maori whare. Excluded  with the greatest difficulty from the best appointed houses in the  colony, in the humbler residences of the bush, and in our shanty, for  example, his name is Legion. Why this should be so, we have never  troubled our heads to inquire; we simply accept the fact as it is.  Possibly our floor, that, in spite of a daily brooming and a weekly  sluicing, is ever well carpeted with dust and mud, is one source of  these pests. And, now I think of it, there is a nightly scuffling  underneath the boards, which leads to the conclusion that pigs, dogs,  and fowls, are harbouring among the piles beneath.    Every night, before turning in, we are accustomed to shake whole  regiments of fleas out of our blankets. Not infrequently we sprinkle the  blankets with kerosene oil; and, sometimes, in hot weather find it  necessary to anoint our bodies all over with the same thing. That keeps  off the crawling plagues until we have time to get to sleep, and then  we do not care for them. But I think we really have got hardened to the  fleas. We feel the annoyance of them but little now.    One of the chums, a harmless, peaceable fellow yclept \"The Fiend\"--I  know not for what particular reason--has lately invented a new game for  our evening's diversion. He calls it flea-loo. After supper it is our  usual custom to sit on the edge of the floor, where it abuts upon the  fireplace. That part of our domicile, it will be remembered, is paved  with a sort of gravel of loose stones, and, sooth to say, with a good  deal of _debris_ of every sort and kind. The stove stands in the middle.  As we sit there, the sensations in our legs remind us that fleas like  warmth too, and that the gravelly bottom of the chimney-place is a  favourite assembly-room of theirs. But they are of aspiring nature, and  this fact was known to the Fiend. Under his advice, each man plants a  stick upright in the gravel before him. Then we make a pool and await  the result. The fleas soon come out, and begin to crawl up the sticks;  and, by-and-by, some individual of the race reaches the top of the  stick. The owner of that stick takes the pool. Here is another gentle  and Arcadian sport.    And now, with considerable trepidation, and with something verging  upon veritable awe, I approach a subject that I feel myself scarcely  competent to handle. Fraught with the deepest interest to every  new-chum, and a matter of no light concern to even the oldest colonist,  it is one that demands an abler and more facile pen than mine to do full  justice to it. Some one has boldly asserted that, throughout the  infinite treasure-house of Nature, every separate and single thing has  its particular and well-defined purpose. Without attempting to dispute a  proposition so emphatically and dogmatically brought forward, it will be  sufficient for me to say that men have asked in shuddering horror, and  must still continue to ask, what part in the economy of creation is the  sphere of duty or usefulness of that malignant thing we call the  KAURI-BUG.[5]    We do not know whether this insect is known to naturalists or not. That  is a slight matter, and not particularly pertinent to the question of  its interest for us. We believe, however, that no naturalist has yet  been found of sufficiently ardent temperament, and of sufficiently hardy  nerves, to attempt to classify or examine this most infamous of bugs.    Appearances are deceptive very often; they are so in this instance.  Nothing could look more innocent and inoffensive than the kauri-bug, yet  few insects rival it in crime. It is an oval shape, anything under and  up to the size of a crown piece. It is flat, black, hard, and shiny, and  resembles a cross between the English black-beetle and the woodlouse or  slater. It stinks. That is all it does, but it is enough. Look at it,  and it is harmless enough. But tread on it, touch it, disturb it never  so slightly, and instantly the whole surrounding atmosphere is permeated  with a stench more infernally and awfully horrible than anything else  this side of the Styx!    The kauri-bug inhabits dead-wood of various kinds, but chiefly does it  love that of the tree from which it derives its name. It invades houses  built with open joints like ours in regiments and battalions, bringing  all its family and luggage with it. The best class of houses are here  built in a fashion styled bug-proof, but even they cannot wholly exclude  this fearful thing. It comes in hidden in the firewood, and once in the  house it stops there, since no one is courageous enough to turn it out.  It appears to be indifferent as to whether the house is new or old,  well-built or ruinous. If the structure is of kauri timber the kauri-bug  will be there, and it will put up with any other wood if kauri timber  is not available. It is one of the peculiar products indigenous to  Northern New Zealand, and it is the least attractive of all.    Dandy Jack, who has been in North America, is my authority for stating  that the celebrated odour of the skunk is mild and refreshing, compared  to the unutterable loathsomeness of that of the kauri-bug. I can well  believe it. How well I remember one of my first nights in the bush! It  appears that one of these diabolical insects had got into my blankets. I  rolled over and crushed it in my sleep. Inured as I had been by  circumstances to bad smells, this conquered me. I awoke perspiring from  a frightful nightmare. I rushed from my bed, from the room, from the  house, to escape the hideous effluvium; and--well, darkness veiled the  rest!    Nature has in this insect achieved the very acme and culmination of  repulsive villainy. Fortunately she has mitigated it in two ways. The  stench is volatile and soon disappears; while settler's noses get used  to it in a measure. Were it not for these merciful "]]]
