Spencer denied the charges with expletives and with emphasis, treating  the accusations as a calumny, and insisting that his change of  principles occurred in the spring of 1798 before his re-election as  senator. This antedated the alien and sedition measures, but not the  appointment of Samuel Jones, making his conversion contemporary with  the candidacy for governor of Chancellor Livingston, to whom he was  related. It is not unlikely that he shared Livingston's confidence in  an election and thought it a good time to join the party of his  relative; but whether his change was a matter of principle, of  self-interest, or of resentment, it bitterly stung the Federalists,  who did not cease to assail him as a turncoat for the flesh-pots.[88]    [Footnote 88: \"Ambrose Spencer's politics were inconsistent enough to  destroy the good name of any man in New England; but he became a  chief-justice of ability and integrity.\"--Henry Adams, _History of the  United States_, Vol. 1, p. 112.]    The debut of the brilliant Root and the St. Paul-like conversion of  Ambrose Spencer were not, however, needed to overthrow a party  responsible for the famous alien and sedition laws. No one has ever  yet successfully defended this hasty, ill-considered legislation, nor  has any one ever admitted responsibility for it, except President  Adams who approved it, and who, up to the last moment of his long  life, contended that it was \"constitutional and salutary, if not  necessary.\" President Adams had, indeed, refrained from using the  power so lavishly given him; but rash subordinates listened to the  dictate of unwise party leaders. The ridiculous character of these  prosecutions is illustrated by a fine of one hundred dollars because  one defendant wished that the wadding used in a salute to John Adams  had lodged in the ample part of the President's trousers.    But the sedition law had a more serious enemy than rash subordinates.  John Armstrong, author of the celebrated \"Newburgh Letters,\" and until  recently a Federalist, wrote a vitriolic petition for its repeal,  which Jedediah Peck circulated for signatures. This incited the  indiscreet and excitable Judge Cooper, father of the distinguished  novelist, to begin a prosecution; and upon his complaint, the United  States marshal, armed with a bench-warrant, carried off Peck to New  York City for trial. It is two hundred miles from Cooperstown to the  mouth of the Hudson, and in the spring of 1800 the marshal and his  prisoner were five days on the way. The newspapers reported Peck as  \"taken from his bed at midnight, manacled, and dragged from his home,\"  because he dared ask his neighbours to petition Congress to repeal an  offensive law. \"The rule of George Third,\" declared the press, \"was  gracious and loving compared to such tyranny.\" In the wildest delirium  of revolutionary days, when patriots were refusing to drink tea, and  feeding it to the fishes, New York had not been more deeply stirred  than now. \"A hundred missionaries in the cause of democracy, stationed  between New York and Cooperstown,\" says Hammond, the historian, \"could  not have done so much for the Republican cause as this journey of  Jedediah Peck from Otsego to the capital of the State. It was nothing  less than the public exhibition of a suffering martyr for the freedom  of speech and the press, and for the right of petition.\"[89]    [Footnote 89: Jabez D. Hammond, _Political History of New York_, Vol.  1, p. 132.]    This was the political condition when Aaron Burr, in the spring of  1800, undertook to gain twelve electoral votes for the Republicans by  carrying the Legislature of New York. It required seventy electoral  votes to choose a President, and outside of New York the  anti-Federalists could count sixty-one. The capture of this State,  therefore, would give them a safe majority. Without advertising his  purposes, Burr introduced the sly methods that characterised his  former campaigns, beginning with the selection of a ticket that would  commend itself to all, and ending with an organisation that would do  credit to the management of the later-day chiefs of Tammany. To avoid  the already growing rivalry between the Clinton and Livingston  factions, George Clinton and Brockholst Livingston headed the ticket,  followed by Horatio Gates of Revolutionary fame, John Broome, soon to  be lieutenant-governor, Samuel Osgood, for two years Washington's  postmaster-general, John Swartout, already known for his vigorous  record in the Assembly, and others equally acceptable. Burr himself  stood for the county of Orange. For the first time in the history of  political campaigning, too, local managers prepared lists of voters,  canvassed wards by streets, held meetings throughout the city, and  introduced other methods of organisation common enough nowadays, but  decidedly novel then.    Hamilton was alive to the importance of the April election, but  scarcely responsible for the critical character of the situation. He  had not approved the alien and sedition measures, nor did he commit  himself to the persecuting policy sanctioned by most Federal leaders,  and although he favoured suppressing newspaper libels against the  government, he was himself alien-born, and of a mind too broad not to  understand the danger of arousing foreign-born citizens against his  party on lines of national sentiment. \"If we make no false step,\" he  wrote Oliver Wolcott, \"we shall be essentially united, but if we push  things to extremes, we shall then give to faction body and  solidity.\"[90] It was hasty United States attorneys and indiscreet  local politicians rather than the greatest of the Federal leaders,  who gave \"to faction body and solidity.\"    [Footnote 90: _Hamilton's Works_ (Lodge), Vol. 8, p. 491.]    Hamilton threw himself with energy into the desperate fight. For four  days, from April 29 to May 2, while the polls were open, he visited  every voting precinct, appealing to the public in his wonderfully  persuasive and captivating manner. On several occasions Burr and  Hamilton met, and it was afterward recalled that courtesy  characterised the conduct of each toward the other, one champion  waiting while the other took his turn. Rarely if ever in the history  of the country have two men of such ability and astuteness  participated in a local canvass. The rivalry was all the more exciting  because it was a rivalry of styles as well as of capacities. Burr was  smooth, polished, concise, never diffuse or declamatory, always  serious and impressive. If we may accept contemporary judgment, he was  a good speaker whom everybody was curious to hear, and from whom no  one turned away in disappointment. On the other hand, Hamilton was an  acknowledged orator, diffuse, ornate, full of metaphor, with flashes  of poetical genius, revelling in exuberant strength, and endowed with  a gift of argumentative eloquence which appealed to the intellect and  the feelings at the same time. Erastus Root says Hamilton's words were  so well chosen, and his sentences so finely formed into a swelling  current, that the hearer would be captivated if not convinced, while  Burr's arguments were generally methodised and compact. To this Root  added a judgment, after thirty years' experience in public life at  Washington and in New York, that \"they were much the greatest men in  the State, and perhaps the greatest men in the United States.\"    When the polls closed the Republicans had carried the Legislature by  twenty-two majority on joint ballot. This secured to them the election  of the needed twelve presidential electors. To recover their loss the  Federalists now clamoured for a change in the law transferring the  election of presidential electors from the Legislature to districts  created for that purpose. Such an amendment would give the  Federalists six of the twelve electors.    This was Hamilton's plan. In an earnest plea he urged Jay to convene  the Legislature in extraordinary session for this purpose. \"The  anti-Federal party,\" he wrote to the Governor, \"is a composition  indeed of very incongruous materials, but all tending to mischief;  some of them to the overthrow of the government by stripping it of its  due energies; others of them by revolutionising it after the manner of  Bonaparte. The government must not be confided to the custody of its  enemies, and, although the measure proposed is open to objection, a  popular government cannot stand if one party calls to its aid all the  resources which vice can give, and the other, however pressing the  emergency, feels itself obliged to confine itself within the ordinary  forms of delicacy and decorum.\"[91]    [Footnote 91: _Hamilton's Works_ (Lodge), Vol. 8, p. 549.]    Jay's response to Hamilton's proposal is not of record, but some time  afterward the great Federalist's letter was found carefully filed  among the papers in the public archives, bearing an indorsement in the  Governor's handwriting: \"This is a measure for party purposes which I  think it would not become me to adopt.\"    The sincerity of Jay's action has been doubted. He was about to retire  from public life, it was said, with no political future before him,  and with that courage which inspires a man under such circumstances,  he declined to act. But Jay's treatment of Hamilton's suggestion  stands out conspicuously as his best judgment at the most trying  moment in a long and eventful life. Jay was a stalwart Federalist. He  had supported Washington and Hamilton in the making of a federal  constitution; he had approved the alien and sedition laws; he had  favourably reported to the Legislature the proposed amendments of  Massachusetts, limiting service in Congress to native-born citizens;  he regarded the advent of Jefferson and his ideas with as much alarm  as Hamilton, and he knew as well as Hamilton that the adoption of the  district plan of "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22594"],[0,"Colonial Records of Virginia (#20)"],[1,"this Collony, from  the infancie therof and untill the expiration of Sir Thomas Smith's  government, may easily be perceived and plainly understood what just  cause he or any els have to boast of the flourishing estate of those  times, wherin so great miseries and callamities were indured, and soe  few workes of moment or importance performed, himselfe beinge justly to  be charged as a prime author therof, by his neglect of providinge and  alloweinge better meanes to proceede in so great a worke, and in  hindering very many of our frendes from sendinge much releife and meanes  who beinge earnestly solicited from hence by our letters--wherin we  lamentablie complained unto them--have often besought Sir Thomas Smith  that they might have leave to supplie us at their owne charge both with  provision of victuall and all other necessaries, wherin he utterlie  denied them so to doe, protestinge to them that we were in noe want at  all, but that we exceeded in abundance and plentie of all things, so  that therby our frendes were moved both to desist from sendinge and  to doubt the truth of our letters, most part of which weare by him  usually intercepted and kept backe; farther giveinge order by his  directions to the Governor heere, that all men's letters should be  searched at the goinge away of ships, and if in anye of them weare  founde that the true estate of the Collony was declared, they were  presented to the Governor and the indighters of them severely punished;  by which meanes noe man durst make any true relation to his frendes of  his owne or the Collonye's true estate; neither was it permitted to anye  to have passe to goe home, but by force were kept heere and employed as  we have saide (save some few), one of whom receved his passe from the  Kinge, and that closely made up in a garter, least it should have been  seized uppon and he kept heere notwithstandinge. Those whom their  frendes procured their passe in open courte from the Companye were, by  private direction, neverthelesse made staye of, others procuringe  private letters having been lett goe.    We must alsoe noat heere, that Sir Thos. Dale, at his arivall finding  himself deluded by the aforesaid protestations, pulled Capt. Newport by  the beard, and threatninge to hange him, for that he affirmed Sir Thos.  Smith's relation to be true, demandinge of him whether it weare meant  that the people heere in Virginia shoulde feed uppon trees.    Soe may we heere conclude, as some have concluded for him, to what great  growth of perfection (with the expence of that seaventie thousand  poundes) the Plantation was advanced in the time of his 12 years'  government, but whether, as it is saide, he be to be praised for the  managaing of these affaires, with much unanimity, moderation, integritie  and judgment, we leave it to censure.    At the end of this twelve yeares arived Sir George Yeardley to be Gov^r  and founde the Collony in this estate and thus furnished, vizt: For  fortification against a forreign ennemie there was none at all; two demy  culverin only were mounted uppon rotten carriages and placed within  James Citty, fitter to shoot downe our houses then to offend an ennemie.  At Charles Hundred, which were mounted by Sir Thos. Dale, two demy  culverin and one sacre; fortifications against a domestique enimie very  mean. For Forts, Towns and Plantations he founde these: James Citty,  Henrico, Charles Citty and Hundred, Shirley Hundred, Arrahattock, Martin  Brandon and Kicoughton, all w^{ch} were but poorely housed and as ill  fortified; for in James Cittie were only those houses that Sir Thom.  Gates built in the time of his government, with one wherin the Gov^r  allwayes dwelt, an addition beinge made therto in the time of Captaine  Sam^l Argoll, and a church, built, wholly at the charge of the  inhabitants of that cittie, of Timber, beinge fifty foote in length and  twenty foot in breadth; at Paspahayes alsoe weare some few slight houses  built; at Henrico, two or three old howses, a poore ruinated church with  some few poore buildings in the Island; Coxen Dale and the Maine and att  Arrahatocke one house, at Charles Cittie sixe howses much decayed, and,  that we may not be too tedious, as these, soe were the rest of the  places furnisht.    For people then alive about the nomber of foure hundred, very many of  them in want of corne, utterlie destitute of cattle, twine, Poultrie and  other Provisions to nourish them.    For Barques, Pinnaces, Shallops, Barges and Boates he founde only one  olde Frigott, which belonged to the Sommer Islandes, one olde Shallopp  built in Sir Thos. Dale's time, one boat built in Sir Sam'l Argoll's  time, with two small boates belonginge to private men. For munition a  very small quantitye, the most part thereof beinge very bad and of  little use. For ministers to instruct the people he founde only three  authorized, two others who never received their orders.    For staple commodities at his arrivall he founde none afoot save only  Tobacco. The natives he founde uppon doubtfull termes, neither did we  ever perceive that at any time they voluntarilie yealded themselves  subjects or servants to our Gracious Soveraigne, neither that ever they  tooke any pride in that title, nor paide they at any time any yearly  contribution of corne for the sustentation of the Collony, nor could we  at any time keepe them in such goode respect or correspondencie that  they and we did become mutuallie helpfull or proffitable, each to other,  but to the contrary, whatsoever at any time was done uppon them  proceeded from fear without love, for such help as we have had from them  have been procured by sworde or trade. And heere can we noe way approve  of that which hath lately beene saide in the behalfe of Sir Thos. Smith,  by some of his new frendes, that a flourishinge plantation in Virginia,  erected in the time of his 12 yeares government, hath since been  distroyed through the ignorance of succeedinge Governors heere, for that  by what we have already saide all the worlde may judge in what a  flourishinge estate it was, and to what growth of perfection it was  advanced, at the arivall of Sir Geo. Yeardley to be Gov^r here, it  beinge then in our judgements, that were members of the colony, in a  poore estate.    The whole 12 yeares expired.    _Aprill, 1619._--Arived Sir Geo. Yeardeley, bringing certain commissions  and instructions from the Company for the better establishinge of a  Commonwealth heere, wherin order was taken for the removing of all those  grievances which formerly were suffred and manifested the same by  publishinge a Proclamation that all those that were residend heere  before the departure of Sir Thos. Dale should be freed and acquitted  from such publique services and labours which formerly they suffered,  and that those cruell lawes by which we had soe longe been governed were  now abrogated, and that we were now to be governed by those free lawes  which his Ma^{ty's} subjects live under in Englande. And farther that  free libertie was given to all men to make choice of their dividents of  lande and, as their abilities and meanes w^d permitt, to possesse and  plant uppon them. And that they might have a hande in the governinge of  themselves, it was granted that a general assemblie should be helde  yearly once, wherat were to be present the Gov^r and Counsell with two  Burgesses from each Plantation freely to be elected by the inhabitants  thereof; this assembly to have power to make and ordaine whatsoever  lawes and orders should by them be thought good and proffittable for our  subsistance. The effect of which proceedinge gave such incouragement to  every person heere that all of them followed their perticular labours  with singular alacrity and industry, soe that, through the blessinge of  God uppon our willinge labors, within the space of three yeares, our  countrye flourished with many new erected Plantations, from the head of  the River to Kicoughtan, beautifull and pleasant to the spectators, and  comfortable for the releife and succor of all such as by occasion did  travaile by land or by water; every man giveinge free entertainment,  both to frendes or others. The plenty of these times likewise was such  that all men generally were sufficiently furnished with corne, and many  alsoe had plenty of cattle, swine, poultry and other good provisions to  nourish them. Monethly courtes were held in every precinct to doe  justice in redressinge of all small and petty matters, others of more  consequence beinge referred to the Gov^r, Counsell and Generall  Assemblie. Now alsoe were begunne and sett a foote the erectinge of Iron  Workes, plantinge of vines and mulberrie trees for the nourishinge of  silke wormes; a trial made for silke grasse tillage for English graine,  gardeninge, and the like, which gave great hopes of present and future  plenty in their severall perticulars, wherin no doubt but much more had  been effected had not great sicknes and mortalitie prevented.    Those yeares fallinge out to be generally contagious through this  continent, the people alsoe sent over arrived heere at the most  unseasonable time of the yeare, beinge at the heat of Sommer, and divers  of the ships brought with them most pestilent infections, wherof many of  their people had died at Sea, soe that these times alsoe of plenty and  libertie were mixed with the calamities of sicknes and mortalitie.           *       *       *       *       *    _In October, 1621_, Arived Sir Fras. Wyatt, Knight, with commission to  be Gov^r and Capt. Gen^l of Virginia. He ratified and confirmed all the  afore mentioned liberties, freedomes and priveledges, to our great  happines and content; the country alsoe flourished and increased in her  former proceedinges, as iron workes, plantinge of vines and mulberrie  for silke, &c. A ship alsoe was sent to the Summer Islandes for such  commodities as that place afforded,"]]]
