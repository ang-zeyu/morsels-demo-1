They are especially  fond of fruits, sweet apples being a favorite food, and are also  partial to cabbage.    Their favorite haunts are the brushy, wooded bottom lands but they  are also found on the hills and mountains; in fact, in almost any  place where they can find food and shelter.    The snowshoe rabbit replaces the cottontail in Canada and the most  northern portions of the United States. As before mentioned they are  larger than the common rabbits and like the northern weasel the color  of their fur varies with the seasons. The summer coat is a reddish  brown, but when the cold weather comes on in the fall they commence  to take on a white color, the fur of the ears and legs being the  first to change and in a few weeks the animal will be perfectly  white. This is nature's provision for the animal's protection, and  their color in winter is so nearly like that of the snow that when  sitting under some log or clump of brush they are almost invisible.  They have many enemies, being preyed upon by all the carnivorous  animals, also by such birds as the hawk and owl, but as they are  exceedingly prolific their numbers increase rapidly.    Every few years, perhaps at regular intervals, but of that I am not  certain, some disease makes its appearance among them and they die  off rapidly. Some naturalists believe that this is caused by  inbreeding as the rabbit's circle of acquaintance is comparatively  small, and his knowledge of the country and the ground covered by his  wanderings is limited to a very small area.    The food of the snowshoe rabbit consists mainly of grasses in summer  and the bark of certain young growths in winter. They are very fond  of salt and wherever there is a trace of it to be found, they will  come nightly and dig up the soil in order to procure it. The northern  settlers who use large numbers of these animals for food sometimes  make a salt lick for the rabbits and watch for the animals in the  early evening.    The feet of the snowshoe rabbit are very large and are heavily  furred, forming a sort of snowshoe which accounts for its common  name. They are very methodical, running the same route so often as to  form a well defined trail, quite common in the northern swamps and  hazel thickets. These trails are followed after the snow falls and  become beaten several inches in depth.    It is from the skins of the snowshoe rabbit that the northern Indians  make the wonderful rabbit skin blankets. The skin is ripped down the  back of the hind legs and is drawn off whole and while still fresh is  cut into one long strip averaging an inch in width. Immediately after  cutting, the strip rolls up leaving the outside covered with fur and  resembling a fur rope. These skins are wound into a ball and kept  frozen until the desired number has been secured when they are woven  into a frame, the ends being sewed together. It makes the warmest bed  covering known, and is used universally by the northern trappers. It  also was a great comfort to those who went into Alaska and Yukon in  search of gold.     [Illustration: Rabbit Snares.]    The jack rabbit is found mostly on the western plains and is the  largest of the American hares. They resemble the ordinary rabbit in  structure, but the ears are very long and the tail is more like that  of the deer. In running they make long leaps, all four feet hanging  straight down, presenting a singular appearance.    Rabbits are seldom trapped with steel traps, but almost every country  boy knows how to take them in box traps baited with sweet apples. The  cottontail may also be taken in a spring pole snare, such as shown in  the cut. The noose is made of twine and is about ten inches in  diameter. When carefully made they are almost certain in action. They  should be baited with sweet apple or cabbage.    The snare used for the snowshoe rabbit is a very simple contrivance.  The white trappers use No. 20 brass wire, doubled and twisted with a  small loop on one end, and made into the form of a slip noose.    The snares are set on the trails, the bottom of the noose being about  four inches above the trail and the loop, about four inches in  diameter, is attached firmly to a brush placed horizontally over the  path. A short stick is set upright under the noose and others are  placed on either side of the snare. When properly arranged the noose  will take the animal by the neck when it attempts to leap through,  and it will be choked by its struggles.    The Indians make the snares of light linen cord but with the white  man this method is a failure as the rabbit will invariably stop and  bite the cord. I do not understand why they do not bite the snares  set by the Indians.    Where tracks are plentiful and good trails cannot be found I have  caught them by placing a few fresh twigs of birch or tamarack on each  side of the snare. The rabbit is certain to find them and after  eating those placed on one side it will attempt to leap through the  noose to reach the others, which, of course, is the end of poor  \"bunny\". The smallest and tenderest shoots should be selected for  bait and only two or three should be placed at a snare.    At other times I have made a fence of small evergreen trees where  signs of the animals were numerous, and have fixed snares in the  openings along the obstruction. This is also a successful method.    I have never learned of any method of trapping or snaring the jack  rabbit, but believe they could be trapped successfully where they  visit the farms and gnaw the bark from fruit trees as they do in some  parts of the west.        CHAPTER XXII.    TRACKS AND SIGNS.    Old and experienced trappers can read the signs of the forest and  stream with a degree of accuracy that to the amateur is surprising.  In this way he can make a fair estimate of the number and kinds of  fur-bearing animals found in a locality, while the novice would see  nothing, or if he did see the tracks and signs he would not be able  to distinguish them, one from another.    To be able to read the signs accurately is essential for successful  hunting and trapping. The expert trapper will know instantly, on  seeing a track, just what animal it was that passed that way, and by  knowing its habits will know about when it is likely to return, and  how to place a trap for its capture. He can also tell with fair  accuracy at what time the animal passed that way, and frequently,  will know whether it was a male or female; whether it was looking for  food or a place of rest, whether it was on its regular route of  travel and where it was going. To the novice all of these signs are  unintelligible.    The art of sign reading can be learned only from experience. While  the writer can distinguish the signs and tracks of the fur-bearing  animals, to put this knowledge in print is exceedingly difficult.  However, I will endeavor here, to describe the tracks of the  fur-bearing and game animals, and believe that the description will  be of value to the amateur.    Before the coming of the tell-tale snow, and the myriads of tracks  which then appear, the stream with its muddy or sandy shores is per  haps the most promising place in which to look for signs. In the mud  alongside of a pool of water, the tracks of that busy little animal  the muskrat, can be seen.    The trail of this animal is accurately shown in the drawing. When  seen at the water's edge, and only a few tracks are visible, the  trail appears irregular, but if one can see where it has walked for  some distance, it will be noted that the animal has a regular step,  some five or six inches in length, and there is also the trail of the  dragging tail, most plainly seen in the soft muddy bottom of the  still, shallow water. In the snow the track will appear the same.  Only the prints of the hind feet are visible, the front feet being  very much smaller, and the print being obliterated by those of the  hind feet. When the animal is running the prints of all four feet are  readily discernible. The print of the hind foot will measure about  two and a fourth inches in length if the full impression of the foot  is to be seen.      [Illustration: Tracks of Furbearing Animals.]    In addition to the tracks other signs may be seen. Where the animals  are found in fair numbers they will have well defined trails leading  from the water. Where the bank is steep the trails are sometimes worn  an inch or more in depth, owing to the muskrat's habit of sliding  down the bank, which habit is not practiced in play, but for  convenience. Other signs are the droppings on the logs which extend  into the water; the dens with an accumulation of grass at the  entrance; also the scratch signs on the bank, the feed beds, houses,  etc.    All signs are plentiful in early fall, and at such times the novice  is likely to overestimate the number of animals, as the muskrat is  very active at that season.    The signs of the beaver are very similar to those of the muskrat, but  the tracks are much larger, and owing to the fact that the level of  the water in the vicinity of a beaver lodge, is raised far above the  muddy shores, by the dam the tracks are seldom seen. However, the  house and dam with the fresh cut wood, and well used trails are all  of the signs that are needed. Old houses and dams are found  frequently, but if there is no fresh cutting about, one may be  certain that the house is uninhabited.    One of the most puzzling things to the novice is to know the number  of inmates, that is, whether or not it is a full family, but methods  of determining this are given in the chapter dealing with this  animal. In the North the beavers are ice bound during the winter  months, but occasionally one may find them emerging from the water at  some springhole near the lodge or dam, and at such times the tracks  may be seen in the snow.    The trail of the otter is unmistakable, owing to its peculiar,  floundering,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/341"],[0,"Myths and Legends of the Sioux (#20)"],[1," witches, and when he came to shoot at  them, missed every shot. \"Let us make haste, as the bad Unktomi may  ruin my arrows.\" They approached the camp and whilst White Plume waited  outside, his promised wife entered Unktomi's tent and said: \"Unktomi,  White Plume is standing outside and he wants his clothes and bow and  arrows.\" \"Oh, yes, I borrowed them and forgot to return them; make haste  and give them to him.\"    Upon receiving his clothes, he was very much provoked to find his fine  clothes wrinkled and his bow twisted, while the arrows were twisted  out of shape. He laid the clothes down, also the bows and arrows, and  passing his hand over them, they assumed their right shapes again. The  daughter took White Plume to her father's tent and upon hearing the  story he at once sent for his warriors and had them form a circle around  Unktomi's tent, and if he attempted to escape to catch him and tie him  to a tree, as he (the chief) had determined to settle accounts with him  for his treatment of White Plume, and the deception employed in winning  the chief's eldest daughter. About midnight the guard noticed something  crawling along close to the ground, and seizing him found it was Unktomi  trying to make his escape before daylight, whereupon they tied him to a  tree. \"Why do you treat me thus,\" cried Unktomi, \"I was just going out  in search of medicine to rub on my arrows, so I can kill the witches.\"  \"You will need medicine to rub on yourself when the chief gets through  with you,\" said the young man who had discovered that Unktomi was  impersonating White Plume.    In the morning the herald announced that the real White Plume had  arrived, and the chief desired the whole nation to witness his  marksmanship. Then came the cry: \"The White Buffalo comes.\" Taking his  red arrow, White Plume stood ready. When the buffalo got about opposite  him, he let his arrow fly. The buffalo bounded high in the air and came  down with all four feet drawn together under its body, the red arrow  having passed clear through the animal, piercing the buffalo's heart. A  loud cheer went up from the village.    \"You shall use the hide for your bed,\" said the chief to White Plume.  Next came a cry, \"the eagle, the eagle.\" From the north came an enormous  red eagle. So strong was he, that as he soared through the air his wings  made a humming sound as the rumble of distant thunder. On he came, and  just as he circled the tent of the chief, White Plume bent his bow, with  all his strength drew the arrow back to the flint point, and sent the  blue arrow on its mission of death. So swiftly had the arrow passed  through the eagle's body that, thinking White Plume had missed, a great  wail went up from the crowd, but when they saw the eagle stop in his  flight, give a few flaps of his wings, and then fall with a heavy thud  into the center of the village, there was a greater cheer than before.  \"The red eagle shall be used to decorate the seat of honor in your  tepee,\" said the chief to White Plume. Last came the white rabbit. \"Aim  good, aim good, son-in-law,\" said the chief. \"If you kill him you will  have his skin for a rug.\" Along came the white rabbit, and White Plume  sent his arrow in search of rabbit's heart, which it found, and stopped  Mr. Rabbit's tricks forever.    The chief then called all of the people together and before them all  took a hundred willows and broke them one at a time over Unktomi's back.  Then he turned him loose. Unktomi, being so ashamed, ran off into the  woods and hid in the deepest and darkest corner he could find. This is  why Unktomis (spiders) are always found in dark corners, and anyone who  is deceitful or untruthful is called a descendant of the Unktomi tribe.              STORY OF PRETTY FEATHERED FOREHEAD    There was once a baby boy who came into the world with a small cluster  of different colored feathers grown fast to his forehead. From this he  derived his name, \"Pretty Feathered Forehead.\" He was a very pleasant  boy as well as handsome, and he had the respect of the whole tribe. When  he had grown up to be a young man, he never, like other young men, made  love to any of the tribe's beauties. Although they were madly in love  with him, he never noticed any of them. There were many handsome girls  in the different camps, but he passed them by.    One day he said: \"Father, I am going on a visit to the Buffalo nation.\"  The father gave his consent, and away went the son. The father and  mother suspected the object of their son's visit to the Buffalo nation,  and forthwith commenced preparing a fine reception for their intended  daughter-in-law. The mother sewed together ten buffalo hides and painted  the brave deeds of her husband on them. This she made into a commodious  tent, and had work bags and fine robes and blankets put inside. This was  to be the tent of their son and daughter-in-law. In a few weeks the son  returned, bringing with him a beautiful Buffalo girl. The parents of the  boy gave a big feast in honor of the occasion, and the son and his wife  lived very happily together.    In the course of time a son came to the young couple, and the father was  very proud of his boy. When the boy became a year old, the father said  to his wife: \"I am going for a visit to the Elk nation.\" The mother  was very sad, as she knew her husband was going after another wife. He  returned, bringing with him a very beautiful elk girl. When the Buffalo  woman saw the elk girl she was very downcast and sad, but the husband  said: \"Don't be sad; she will do all the heavy work for you.\"    They lived quite happily together for a long time. The Elk girl also  became the mother of a fine boy. The two boys had grown up large enough  to play around. One day the Elk woman was tanning hides outside and the  two boys were playing around near their mothers, when all at once the  buffalo boy ran across the robe, leaving his tracks on the white robe  which his step-mother had nearly completed. This provoked the elk woman  and she gave vent to her feelings by scolding the boy: \"You clumsy flat  mouth, why couldn't you run around my work, instead of across it?\" The  buffalo cow standing in the door, heard every word that the elk woman  had said, and when she heard her son called flat mouth it made her  very angry, although she did not say a word to any one. She hurriedly  gathered some of her belongings and, calling her son, she started off in  a westerly direction.    The husband being absent on a hunting expedition did not return until  late in the afternoon. Upon his return his oldest boy always ran out  to meet him, but this time as the boy did not put in an appearance, the  father feared that something had happened to the boy. So hurriedly going  to his tent he looked around, but failing to see the boy or his mother,  he asked his elk wife, where the boy and his mother were. The elk  wife answered: \"She took her boy on her back and started off in that  direction,\" (pointing towards the west). \"How long has she been gone?\"  \"Since early morning.\" The husband hurriedly caught a fresh horse and,  without eating anything, rode off in the direction taken by his buffalo  wife and boy. Near dark he ascended a high hill and noticed a small tent  down in the valley. It was a long distance down to the tent, so it was  very late when he arrived there. He tethered his horse and went into  the tent and found the boy and his mother fast asleep. Upon lying down  beside them the boy awoke, and upon seeing his father, motioned to him  to go outside with him.    On going outside the boy told his father that it would be useless for  him to try and coax his mother to return, as she was too highly insulted  by the elk wife to ever return. Then the boy told about what the elk  wife had said and that she had called him flat mouth. \"My mother is  determined to return to her people, but if you want to follow us you  may, and perhaps, after she has visited with her relatives a little  while, you may induce her to return with you. In the morning we are  going to start very early, and as the country we will travel through  is very hard soil, I will stamp my feet hard so as to leave my tracks  imprinted in the softest places, then you will be able to follow the  direction we will take.\"    The two went into the tent and were soon fast asleep. The father, being  very much fatigued, slept very soundly, and when he awoke the sun was  beating down upon him. The mother and boy were nowhere to be seen. The  tent had been taken down from over him so carefully that he had not been  awakened. Getting his horse, he mounted and rode after the two who had  left him sleeping. He had no trouble in following the trail, as the boy  had stamped his feet hard and left his little tracks in the soft places.    That evening he spied the little tent again and on getting to it found  them both asleep. The boy awoke and motioned for his father to go  outside. He again told his father that the next day's travel would be  the hardest of all. \"We will cross a great plain, but before we get  there we will cross a sandy hollow. When you get to the hollow, look at  my tracks; they will be deep into the sand, and in each track you will  see little pools of water. Drink as much as you can, as this is the only  chance you will get to have a drink, there being no water from there to  the big ridge, and it will be dark by the time you get to the ridge. The  relations of my mother live at that ridge and I will come and talk to  you once more, before I leave you to join my mother's people.\"    Next morning, as before, he awoke to find himself alone. They had left  him and proceeded on their journey. He mounted again and when he arrived  at the sandy hollow, sure enough, there, deep in the sand, were the  tracks of his son filled to the top with water. He drank and drank until  he had drained the last one. Then he arose and continued on the trail,  and near sundown"]]]
