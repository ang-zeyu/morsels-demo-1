The edges of bones or  undersides of fossils are smeared with this, tied with string, and  left for a day or so to unite.    The reader has now a repertoire of poisonous and harmless preparations  from which he may choose. As for myself, for the preservation of  birds, I pin my faith to formula No. 4, viz, my Preservative Soap for  the inside of the skin, and a wash of benzoline or turpentine  liberally applied from time to time--say twice a year--to the outside  of all uncased or exposed specimens. This, it will be seen, entirely  does away with the use of any poison, and yet is proved to be of the  highest efficacy.    For those who do not object to expense nor to the use of a poisonous  preparation, a wash of Waterton's Solution (No. 5), or the sulphuric  ether preparation (No. 18), can be substituted for benzoline or  turpentine. I mention the expense, because only rectified spirits of  wine, or pure sulphuric ether, will do for birds; the methylated  spirit, though of service for washing over most subjects, is not so  good when applied to the delicate feathers of birds, as it leaves on  drying a certain impure residuum behind it.    For mammals I recommend my formula of burnt alum and saltpetre (No.  9), followed by a wash of benzoline or turpentine twice a year, or by  any one of the mercurial preparations given.    On a retrospect of this chapter it will, I think, be admitted that, if  I am adverse to the use of any poisonous preparations in taxidermy, I  at least point out the why and wherefore, as also an alternative  course, showing at the same time the benefits and defects of both  systems. I now, therefore, leave the amateur to choose for  himself--bearing in mind the time-honoured aphorism, chacun a son  gout.

CHAPTER V.    SKINNING AND PRESERVING BIRDS.    IN order that this shall be a thoroughly practical chapter, I will, in  my method of working, copy the admirable plan of my old sporting  favourite, Col. Hawker, who, when wishing to note down some difficult  point, was in the habit of doing with his own hands all things  pertaining to the matter at issue, because, as he said, he might not  make mistakes when subsequently writing upon knotty subjects intended  for his readers' consideration.    I have, therefore, specially procured a starling, as I consider this  bird the very best for the amateur's purpose, not only on account of  the toughness of the skin, but also because, being a medium-sized  bird, it presents no difficult points in skinning, and with this bird  before me I shall minutely instruct my pupil, pointing out each step  that has to be taken and each difficulty that is likely to arise.    As I shall have occasion constantly to refer to the various parts of  the skeleton, I now give an engraving of that of the Peregrine Falcon,  in order to help my explanations in the future (see Plate II.).    Having placed ready for use the skinning knife (see Fig. 11), the  scissors (Fig. 14), and the cobbler's crooked awl in handle, a pot of  preservative mixture, some cotton wool or wadding, some tow, and a  needle and thread; lay the starling on its back on a piece of clean  paper, the head of the bird pointing from the operator; then seize the  bird by the sides of the head with the first two fingers and thumb of  the left hand in opposition, the awl held in the palm of the right  hand, and a piece of wool between the right-hand finger and thumb;  then insert the point of the awl between the upper and lower  mandibles, and, having opened them, keep them open with the first  finger of the right hand, removing the piece of wool which should have  been previously placed there by the sportsman (see instructions re  shot birds, at end of Chapter II.). Replacing it with the fresh piece  of wool held in readiness, plug the nostrils in the same manner.    As even this simple operation will have somewhat disarranged the  feathers of the head and neck, smooth them down with the fingers,  taking care, however, not to stretch the neck in doing so. The next  operation is to hold the left-hand wing with the left hand, and with  the fingers of the right hand break or disjoint the bone of the wing  as close to the body as possible, i.e, across the \"humerus\" (E) (in  the case of large birds, or for some special purpose, this bone is  often left intact, but the amateur will be puzzled how to subsequently  arrange it in the skin if unbroken). Repeat this on the other wing.  For those whose fingers are not strong enough to do this effectually,  I recommend a small pair of flat-nosed pliers, some sizes larger than  the \"feather pliers\" (Fig. 19).    Large birds may have their wings broken at the humeri (E) by striking  them with a stick or hammer in such a manner as not to break nor  seriously disarrange the feathers; the largest-sized pliers (Fig. 16)  may also be used for this purpose, but in that case a piece of clean  rag should be folded in the jaws of the pliers so as to envelope the  upper and under surface of the wing, in order to protect the feathers  from injury. Practice will, however, point out the best method of  doing this. Next take hold of the legs with the fingers and gently  twist them out of joint at the junction of the tibia and femur.    Now, keeping the head of the bird toward you, part the feathers away  from each side of the sternum or breast-bone; then with the knife held  short in the hand, the point placed exactly in the centre of the bird  (calculating from the bill to the tip of the tail), make the first  incision just on the right side of the breast bone down to the vent,  taking care not to cut so deeply as to expose the intestines. Now turn  the bill towards your right, and gently lay hold of the cut edge of  the skin, which you see shining whitely in front of you; then with the  point of the knife--the cutting edge kept on the flesh--gently loosen  the skin above, below, and downwards. Completely reverse the bird, and  repeat this for the other side.    At this stage the body may be held down, with the knife pressed on the  side of the breast bone, and thus the two first fingers of the left  hand may be advantageously employed--but in a very gentle manner--to  loosen the skin around the upper part of the breast-bone from the  inside, while the thumb regulates the pull from the outside. All must  be done with the feathers kept as much away from the flesh as  possible.    Fig. 22--Starling--Showing Position of First Incision and the  Commencement of the Removal of the Skin.    Fig. 22 shows the appearance which the specimen should now present.    The skin being, as it were, nicely \"persuaded\" from the flesh (more  being done by pushing than by pulling), the legs begin to appear. Take  hold of the one nearest to you with the right hand, at the same time  inserting the fingers of the left inside the skin; then, by gently  pushing up with the right hand, free the legs sufficiently to show the  second joint, where it has been previously twisted or broken.    Laying down the knife, and picking up the scissors, force their point  underneath the joint, marked P in Plate II, and cut it completely off;  it should then be clear of the flesh, showing the skin on either side  as if it were a stocking turned inside out. Pull it gently by the claw  back into its proper position, and there leave it, and do the same by  the other leg, turning the bird again for that, purpose.    Both the legs should now be entirely free, not holding to the body at  any point. Taking up the knife again, carefully work with it down  toward the tail, and as far round the back as you can get with safety.  Now let the bird rest on its head, as it were, with the beak from you,  and, placing the fingers with the thumb on the back (which is now  underneath), the middle finger on the root of the tail inside, flanked  by the first and third fingers keeping down the skin on either side,  cautiously insert the knife through the skin of the vent, and cut that  free, cutting upward in a slanting direction; having done this,  carefully cut away on the root of the tail, at the same time freeing  it wherever it sticks; then, when nothing but one bone, that is to  say, the last caudal vertebra, holds it, slip the knife underneath and  cut with a drawing motion upward. The tail is now entirely separated  from the body.    Now advance the fingers "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26030"],[0,"The Automobilist Abroad (#20)"],[1,"amargue, between the blue of the sky and the  blue of the Mediterranean waves, sits the gaunt, grim bourg of  fisherfolk and herders of the cattle and sheep of the neighbouring  plain. The lone fortress-church rises tall and severe in its  outlines, and the whole may be likened to nothing as much as a desert  mirage that one sees in his imagination.    At the foot of the crenelated, battlemented walls of the church are  the white, pink, and blue walled houses of the huddling population,  and the dory-like boats of the fishers.    Officially the town is known as Stes. Maries-de-la-Mer, but the  _reliques_ of the three Marys, who fled from Judea in company with  Sts. Lazare, Maxim, and Trophime, and other followers, including  their servant Sara, have given it the popular name of \"Les Saintes.\"    The exiles, barely escaping death by drowning, came to shore here,  and, thankful for being saved from death, thereupon celebrated the  first mass to be said in France, the saints Maxim and Lazare  officiating.    Maxim, Lazare, Sidoine, Marthe, and Madeleine immediately set out to  spread the Word throughout Provence in the true missionary spirit,  but the others, the three Marys, St. Trophime, and Sara, remained  behind to do what good they might among the fishers.    The pilgrimage to this _basilique_ of \"Les Saintes\" has ever been one  of great devotion. In 1347 the Bishops of Paris and of Coutances, in  Normandy, accorded their communicants many and varied indulgences for  having made \"_la feste S. Mari Cleophee qui est le XXVe Mai, et la  feste S. Marie Salome, XXIIe Octobre, festeront, O l'histoire d'elles  prescherent, liront ou escouteront attentilment et devotement._\"    In the fourteenth century three thousand or more souls drew a  livelihood from the industries of \"Les Saintes\" and the  neighbourhood, and its civic affairs were administered by three  consuls, who were assisted in their duties by three classes of  citizen office-holders--_divities_, _mediocres_, and _paupers_, the  latter doubtless the \"_povres gens_\" mentioned in the testament of  Louis I. of Provence, he who bequeathed the guardianship of his soul  to \"_Saintes Maries Jacobe et Salome, Catherine, Madeleine et  Marthe._\"    The first day's celebration was devoted to the further gathering of  the throng and the \"Grand Mess.\" At the first note of the  \"Magnificat\" the _reliques_ were brought forth from the upper chapel  and the crowd from within and without broke into a thunderous  \"_Vivent les Saintes Maries!_\" Then was sung the \"_Cantique des  Saintes:_\"      \"O grandes Saintes Maries    Si cheries    De notre divin Sauveur,\" etc.    On the second day a procession formed outside the church for the  descent to the historic sands, upon which the holy exiles first made  their landing, the men bearing on their shoulders a representation of  the barque which brought the saints thither. There were prelates and  plebeians and tourists and vagabond gipsies in line, and one and all  they entered into the ceremony with an enthusiasm--in spite of the  sweltering sun--which made up for any apparent lack of devoutness,  for, alas! most holy pilgrimages are anything but holy when taken in  their entirety.    The church at \"Les Saintes\" is a wonder-work. As at Assisi, in Italy,  there are three superimposed churches, a symbol of the three states  of religion; the crypt, called the catacombs, and suggestive of  persecution; the fortified nave, a symbol of the body which prays,  but is not afraid to fight; and the _chapelle superieure_, the holy  place of the saints of heaven, the Christian counsellors in whose  care man has been confided. This, at any rate, is the professional  description of the symbolism, and whether one be churchman or not he  is bound to see the logic of it all.    Deep down in the darkened crypt are the _reliques_ of the dusky Sara,  the servant of the holy Marys. She herself has been elevated to  sainthood as the _patronne_ of the vagabond gipsies of all the world.  On the occasion of the Fete of Les Saintes Maries the nomads,  Bohemians, and Gitanos from all corners of the globe, who have been  able to make the pilgrimage thither, pass the night before the shrine  of their sainted _patronne_, as a preliminary act to the election of  their queen for the coming year.    The gipsy of tradition is supposed to be a miserly, wealthy,  sacrilegious fellow who goes about stealing children and dogs and  anything else he can lay his hands upon. He may have his faults, but  to see him kneeling before the shrine of his \"_patronne reine Sara,_\"  ragged and travel-worn and yet burning costly candles and saying his  _Aves_ as piously and incessantly as a praying-machine of the East,  one can hardly question but that they have as much devoutness as most  others.    The hotels of \"Les Saintes\" offer practically nothing in the way of  accommodation, and what there is, which costs usually thirty sous a  night, has, during the fete, an inflated value of thirty or even  fifty francs, and, if you are an automobilist, driving the most  decrepit out-of-date old crock that ever was, they will want to  charge you a hundred. You will, of course, refuse to pay it, for you  can eat up the roadway at almost any speed you like,--there is no one  to say you nay on these lonesome roads,--and so, after paying fifty  centimes a pailful for some rather muddy water to refresh the water  circulation of your automobile, you pull out for some other place--at  least we did. One must either do this, or become a real nomad and  sleep in the open, with the stars for candles, and a bunch of  beach-grass for a pillow. If you were a _Romany cheil_ you would  sleep in, or under, your own _roulotte_, on a mattress, which, in the  daytime, is neatly folded away in the rear of your wagon, or hung in  full view, temptingly spread with a lace coverlet. This in the hope  that some passing pilgrim will take a fancy to the lace spread and  want to buy it; when will come a trading and bargaining which will  put horse-selling quite in the shade, for it is here that the woman  of the establishment comes in, and the gipsy woman on a trade is a  Tartar.    Finally, on the last day, came the \"_Grande Entree des Tauraux,_\"  which, it would seem, was the chief event which drew the Camargue  population thither. They came in couples, a man and a woman on the  back of a single Camargue pony, whole families in a Provencal cart,  on foot, on bicycles, and in automobiles.    [Illustration: Peasants of the Crau]    Six Spanish-crossed bulls, were brought up in a great closed van and  loosed in an improvised bull-ring, of which the church wall formed  one side, and the roof a sort of a tribune. What the cure thought of  all this is not clear, but as the alms-coffers of the church were  already full to the lids, and the parish depends largely upon the  contributions of visitors to replenish its funds, any seeming  sacrilege was winked at.    For three days we had \"made the fete\" and saw it all, and did most of  the things that the others did, except that we always slept at St.  Gilles, far away by the long flat road which winds in and out among  the marshes, flamingo nests, and rice-fields of the Camargue.    The \"bull-fight,\" so called, was nothing so very bloodthirsty or  terrifying; merely the worrying by the \"amateurs\" of a short-legged,  little black bull, about the size of a well-formed Newfoundland dog,  or perhaps a little larger--appearances are often deceptive when one  receives a disappointment.    Truly, as Mistral says, Provence is a land of joy and, laughter, and  fetes followed close on one another, it seemed.    We had seen the announcements in the local journals of a \"_Mis a  Mort_\" at Nimes, and a \"_Corrida de Meurte_\"--borrowing the phrase  from the Spanish--at Arles, each to take place in the great Roman  arenas, which had not seen bloodshed for centuries; not since the  days when the Romans matched men against each other in gladiatorial  combat, and turned tigers loose upon captive slaves.    The \"to-the-death\" affairs of Arles and Nimes appealed to us only  that we might contrast the modern throngs that crowd the benches with  those which history tells us viewed the combats of old. Doubtless  there is little resemblance, but all the same there is a certain gory  tradition hanging about the old walls and arches of those great  arenas which is utterly lacking in the cricket-field, tawdry plazas  of some of the Spanish towns. The grim arcades of these great Roman  arenas are still full of suggestion.    We did not see either the \"_Mis a Mort_\" at Arles, or the \"_Corrida  de Meurte_\" at Nimes; the automobile got stalled for a day in the  midst of the stony Crau, with a rear tire which blew itself into  pieces, and necessitated a journey by train into Arles in order to  get another to replace it. Owing to the slowness of this apology for  a railway train, and the awkwardness of the timetable, the great  \"_Mis a Mort_\" at Arles was long over ere we had set out over the  moonlit Crau for Martigues on the shores of the Etang de Berre.    [Illustration: Les Saintes]    We knew Martigues of old, its _bouillabaisse_, the _Pere Chabas_ and  all the cronies of the Cafe du Commerce where you kept your own  special bottle, of whatever _aperitif_ poison you fancied, in order  that you might be sure of getting it unadulterated.    \"_La Venise de Provence,_\" Martigues, is known by artists far and  wide. Chabas and his rather grimy little hotel, which he calls the  Grand Hotel something or other, has catered for countless hundreds of  artist folk who have made the name and fame of Martigues as an  artist's sketching-ground. After a three weeks' pretty steady  automobile run the artist of the party craved peace and rest and an  opportunity of putting Martigues's glorious sunsets on canvas, and so  we camped out with Chabas, and ate _bouillabaisse_ and the _beurre de  Provence_ and _langouste_"]]]
