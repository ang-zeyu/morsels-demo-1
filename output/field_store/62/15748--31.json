The World Factbook is first produced on  CD-ROM.      1996    Maps accompanying each entry now present more detail. Flags also  introduced for nearly all entities. Various new entries appear under  Geography and Communications. Factbook abbreviations consolidated  into a new Appendix A. Two new appendices present a Cross-Reference  List of Country Data Codes and a Cross-Reference List of  Hydrogeographic Data Codes. Geographic coordinates added to Appendix  H, Cross-Reference List of Geographic Names. Factbook size expands  by 95 pages in one year to reach 652.      1997    The World Factbook introduced onto the Internet. A special printed  edition prepared for the CIA's 50th anniversary. A schema or Guide  to Country Profiles introduced. New color maps and flags now  accompany each country profile. Category headings distinguished by  shaded backgrounds. Number of categories expanded to nine - the  current number - with the addition of an Introduction (for only a  few countries) and Transnational Issues (which includes  Disputes-international and Illicit drugs).      1998    The Introduction category with two entries, Current issues and  Historical perspective, expanded to more countries. Last year for  the production of CD-ROM versions of the Factbook.      1999    Historical perspective and Current issues entries in the  Introduction category combined into a new Background statement.  Several new Economy entries introduced. A new physical map of the  world added to the back-of-the-book reference maps.      2000    A new \"country profile\" added on the Southern Ocean. The Background  statements dramatically expanded to over 200 countries and  possessions. A number of new Communications entries added.      2001    Background entries completed for all 267 entities in the Factbook.  Several new HIV/AIDS entries introduced under the People category.  Revision begun on individual country maps to include elevation  extremes and a partial geographic grid. Weights and Measures  appendix deleted.      2002    New entry on Distribution of Family income - Gini index added.  Revision of individual country maps continued (process still  ongoing).      2003    In the Economy category, petroleum entries added for oil production,  consumption, exports, imports, and proved reserves, as well as  natural gas proved reserves.      2004    Bi-weekly updates launched on The World Factbook Web site.  Additional petroleum entries included for natural gas production,  consumption, exports, and imports. In the Transportation category,  under Merchant marine, subfields added for foreign-owned vessels and  those registered in other countries. Descriptions of the many forms  of government mentioned in the Factbook incorporated into the  Definitions and Notes.      2005    In the People category, a Major infectious diseases field added for  countries deemed to pose a higher risk for travelers. In the Economy  category, entries included for Current account balance, Investment,  Public debt, and Reserves of foreign exchange and gold. The  Transnational issues category expanded to include Refugees and  internally displaced persons. Category headings receive distinctive  colored backgrounds. These distinguishing colors are used in both  the printed and online versions of the Factbook. Size of the printed  Factbook reaches 702 pages.      2006    In the Economy category, national GDP figures now presented at  Official Exchange Rates (OER) in addition to GDP at purchasing power  parity (PPP). Entries in the Transportation section reordered;  Highways changed to Roadways, and Ports and harbors to Ports and  terminals.      2007    In the Government category, the Capital entry significantly expanded  with up to four subfields, including new information having to do  with time. The subfields consist of the name of the capital itself,  its geographic coordinates, the time difference at the capital from  coordinated universal time (UTC), and, if applicable, information on  daylight saving time (DST). Where appropriate, a special note is  added to highlight those countries with multiple time zones. A  Trafficking in persons entry added to the Transnational issues  category. A new appendix, Weights and Measures, (re)introduced to  the online version of the Factbook.      2008    In the Geography category, two fields focus on the increasingly  vital resource of water: Total renewable water resources and  Freshwater withdrawal. In the Economy category, three fields added  for: Stock of direct foreign investment - at home, Stock of direct  foreign investment - abroad, and Market value of publicly traded  shares. Concise descriptions of all major religions included in the  Definitions and Notes. Responsibility for printing of The World  Factbook turned over to the Government Printing Office.      2009    The online Factbook site completely redesigned with many new  features. In the People category, two new fields provide information  on education in terms of opportunity and resources: School Life  Expectancy and Education expenditures. Additionally, the  Urbanization entry expanded to include all countries. In the Economy  category, five fields added: Central bank discount rate, Commercial  bank prime lending rate, Stock of money, Stock of quasi money, and  Stock of domestic credit.      2010    In order to facilitate comparisons over time, dozens of the entries  in the Economy category expanded to include two (and in some cases  three) years' worth of data. A variety of enhancements introduced on  the Factbook Web site.      2011    Weekly updates inaugurated on the The World Factbook Web site. The  dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles results in two new listings:  Curacao and Sint Maarten.

(#20)"],[1,"condition, its diameter,  instead of being eleven times that of the Earth, will be not quite seven,  and the force of gravity at the surface will be greater than that of the  Earth in the same proportion. A man who here weighs 150 lb. will there  weigh over 1000 lb.; and the muscular effort of movement will be increased  in the same ratio. The athlete who here can clear a height 5 ft. 8 in.  will there, with like pains, surmount 10 inches; and other efforts will be  in the same proportion. The atmosphere, supposing it to be in proportion  to the mass of Jupiter, will exercise a pressure of 46-1/2 \"atmospheres,\"  or more than 680 lb., to the square inch. Following on this enormous  pressure at the surface would be the rapidity with which the atmosphere  would thin out in the upward direction. The level of half-pressure would  be attained by ascending less than half a mile in height; that is to say,  there would be a difference of pressure of 340 lb. on the square inch from  that experienced at the sea-level. We know from the fact that fishes live  at enormous depths in the ocean, that living organisms can be constructed  to endure great pressures, but they are not constructed to endure great  alterations of pressure. The deep-sea fishes are as instantly killed by  being brought up to the surface, as the surface fishes or the land animals  would be if they were plunged into the depths. And it is clear that on  Jupiter a low range of hills that on the Earth would be considered only  an easy climb, would be an impassable barrier, not only from the immense  exertion of mounting it, but chiefly from the unendurable change of  pressure which the ascent would involve.    The sevenfold gravity of Jupiter, taken in connection with this enormous  atmospheric pressure, would tend to make the meteorological disturbances  of the planet violent far beyond anything of which the Earth can furnish  an example. The atmosphere would possess a high viscosity, and differences  in condition, pressure and saturation would tend to accumulate, until at  length the balance would be restored with explosive suddenness and force.  Here our most violent tornadoes may reach a speed of 100 miles an hour; on  Jupiter, gales of five or six times that velocity would be common. We  cannot conceive that living organisms would be able to grow, flourish and  multiply where the conditions were so cataclysmic.    This difficulty must always exist where the planet is great in mass, and  the force of gravity high at the surface. The case of Saturn is not so  extreme as that of Jupiter, though it is probably sufficiently severe to  exclude it from the ranks of worlds that could ever be dwelt in. The  atmospheric pressure would be about 21 \"atmospheres,\" or more than 300 lb.  on the square inch. The level of half-pressure would be reached at about  three-quarters of a mile, and the force of gravity be nearly 4-1/2 times  that of the Earth.    But the serious condition for Saturn would come from that feature which  renders it by far the most attractive of all the planets seen in the  telescope, the presence of the wonderful Ring system.    To us, viewing Saturn from afar, and from practically the same direction  as the Sun, the Rings are seen lit up; but to a dweller on Saturn, the  Rings during the day are between his world and the Sun, and hence turn  their dark side toward him. More than that, the telescope shows us that  the Rings cast a shadow on the planet; in other words, they eclipse part  of it; and this shadow changes its position with the progress of the  Saturnian year. Proctor computed that if the Rings were a hundred miles in  thickness, the equator would suffer, in consequence, total eclipse for  nearly ten days at each equinox, and partial eclipse for about forty days  more. Moving away from the equator, each higher latitude would have a  longer and longer period of eclipse in the winter half of its year; the  higher the latitude, the later after the autumnal equinox the eclipse  would begin, and the longer it would last, until about latitude 40 deg. was  reached. Here the eclipses would begin nearly three terrestrial years  after the time of the autumnal equinox. At first the Sun would be eclipsed  only in the morning and evening of each day, but the length of the daily  eclipse would increase, until the Sun was hidden the whole day long. This  period of total eclipse would last for about 6 years 8 months, terrestrial  reckoning, or with the periods of partial eclipse, 8 years and nearly 10  months. Whatever the efficiency of the Sun that afforded light and heat to  such a planet, it is clear that such eclipses must be fatal to life in two  ways: light and heat would be cut off from wide regions of the planet for  long periods of time, and terrible meteorological convulsions must follow  in the train. Here on the Earth, though a total eclipse generally lasts  only two or three minutes, the atmospheric disturbance is perceptible, and  the fall of temperature very marked, and it does not require much  reflection to see that the analogous disturbance in an atmosphere twenty  times as dense must be terrific indeed during an eclipse that lasts not a  few minutes only, but for more than six of our years.    The case of Uranus introduces us to another class of conditions fatal to  habitability. The equator of Jupiter is inclined only 3 deg. to the plane of  its orbit; the difference in its seasons is, therefore, almost  imperceptible; there is hardly any alteration in the incidence of the  solar rays; it is, as if on the Earth, the height of the Sun at noon in  mid-winter were what it actually is on the 14th of March, and its height  at midsummer the same as we observe on March 28. The inclination of the  equator of Saturn is considerably greater than that of Mars or the Earth,  so that its seasons are more pronounced, but not to an extent that would  introduce any radical difference. But for Uranus, the inclination of the  equator to the plane of the orbit is 82 deg. If this were the case for the  Earth, the noonday sun for London would be, at the spring equinox, 38-1/2 deg.  high as at present, but its altitude day by day would increase with great  rapidity, and before the end of April, the Sun at noon would be right in  the zenith, and 13 deg. above the horizon at midnight. At midsummer, indeed,  it would be only 59 deg. high at noonday, but it would be north of the zenith  instead of south, and at technical midnight, it would still be 44 deg. in  altitude, thus moving round in a very small circle, only 15 deg. in diameter.  From about April 18 to August 25--that is to say, for 129 days--the Sun  would never set, and unlike the summer day of our own polar regions now,  wherein the Sun, though always present, is always low down in the sky, for  much of that period it would pass the meridian quite close to the zenith.    As the year of Uranus is 84 times the length of our year, the London of  Uranus would have to endure not far short of 30 years continuous  scorching.    And the winter would be as long; the perpetual day of summer would be  replaced by a night as enduring. More than 29 years of unbroken darkness,  of unmitigated cold, cannot possibly ever consist with the conditions  necessary for life upon a planet. Whatever the brightness of the imagined  sun of Uranus, if for 29 years at a time that sun were below the horizon,  the water on the planet must be congealed, and during the 29 years of  unbroken day all the water would be as certainly evaporated.    Thus, though Uranus is not burdened by the enormous mass of Jupiter, nor  overshadowed, like Saturn, by a system of rings, the extraordinary  inclination of its axis introduces a condition which is as fatal to it, as  a world to dwell in, as any of the disabilities of the other planets.    It is curious that these four outer planets, that resemble each other so  strikingly in many of their conditions--in their vast size, high albedo,  low density, and vaporous envelopes, that show, in their spectra, not  merely the lines of reflected sunlight, but also special lines due to  their own atmospheres (the chief of these being common to all the four  planets)--should yet, in the inclination of their axes to the plane of  their orbits, display every possible variety. The axis of Jupiter is  almost normal to its orbit, that of Uranus lies almost in the plane of its  orbit. The axes of Saturn and Neptune have a mean inclination, but it  would appear that the rotation of Neptune is in the reverse direction to  that of planets in general, so that the true inclination is usually taken  as being the complement of the observed angle, as if the axis were turned  right over. It is uncertain whether this would have any important effect  upon the habitability of the planet, but it supplies the fourth possible  case for the position of the axis.          CHAPTER XII    THE FINAL QUESTION      In passing in review the various members of the solar system, it has been  seen that there are many conditions that have to be fulfilled before a  planet can be regarded as the possible abode of life, because there are  many conditions necessary in order that water may exist on its surface in  the liquid state. The size and mass of the planet are restricted within  quite narrow limits; and a world much larger or much smaller than our own  is necessarily excluded. The supply of light and heat received from the  Sun must not fall much below that received by the Earth, nor greatly  exceed it; in other words, the distance of the planet from its Sun is  somewhat precisely fixed, since the light and heat vary inversely not as  the distance, but as its square. Of course, in different systems, with  suns of different power, the most favourable distance will not be the same  in each; but in any system there will be one most advantageous distance,  and no great departure from it will be possible. This condition further  "]]]
