We saw before that such belief is indeed nothing  else but a motor setting in which certain ways of action are prepared.  We are to think in accordance with the belief in the suggested idea and  the channels for discharge in the opposite direction are closed. Even  the ordinary life shows us everywhere that the step from attention to  belief is a short one. The effort to grasp the object clearly works as a  suggestion to accept that which we are seeking as really existing, and  that from which we are to abstract and which we are to rule out through  our attention, we believe to be non-existent. The prestidigitator does  his tricks in order to sidetrack our attention, but he succeeds in  making us believe that we see or do not see whatever he wishes.    That the motor setting alone determines those changes and that a real  sleeplike inability of the centers does not set in, can also be  demonstrated by the results of later hypnotizations. I ask my hypnotized  subject not to perceive the friend in the room; he is indeed unable to  see him or to hear him. Yet his visual and acoustic centers are not  impaired, the defect is only selective, inasmuch as he sees me, the  hypnotizer, and not the friend. But even this selection inhibits only  the attitude and not the sensorial excitement. If I hypnotize him again  to-morrow and suggest to him now to remember all that the friend did and  said during yesterday's meeting, he is able to report correctly the  sense impressions which he got, which were inhibited only as long as  they contradicted the suggestion, but now rush to consciousness as soon  as the suggestion is reversed. As a matter of course, he must therefore  have received impressions through eye and ear in his hypnotic sleep of  yesterday from all that happened, only he was not aware of it because  the channels of the accepting attitude were blocked.    As soon as the over-attention has produced the acceptance of the belief,  all further effects are automatic and necessary. If I tell the  hypnotized person that he cannot speak and he absorbs this proposition,  with that completeness in which he accepts it as a fact, not speaking  itself unavoidably results. The motor ideas with which the speech  movement has to start are cut off and the subject yields passively to  the fate that he cannot intonate his voice. Thus a special influence on  the will is in no way involved. If the idea is accepted, and that means,  if the preparatory setting for the action has been completed, the ideas  of opposite activity must remain ineffective; the suggested idea must  discharge itself in action without resistance. As a matter of course the  new line of action will then surround itself with its own associations  and will thus give to the subject the impression that he is acting from  his own motives. As soon as the psychophysical principles are  understood, there is indeed no difficulty in going from the simplest  experience to those spectacular ones where we may suggest to the  profoundly hypnotized person that he is a little child or that he is  George Washington. In the one case, he will speak and cry and play and  write as in his present imagination a child would behave; in the other  case, he will pose in an attitude which he may have seen in a picture of  Washington. There is nothing mysterious and his utterances are  completely dependent upon his own ideas, which may be very different  from the real wisdom of a Washington and the real unwisdom of a child. I  may suggest to him to be the Czar, by that he will not become able to  speak Russian. In the same way I may suggest changes of the  surroundings; he may take my room for the river upon which he paddles  his canoe, or for the orchard in which he picks apples from my  bookshelves.    Finally there is no new principle involved, if the action which is  prepared by any belief has to set in after the awaking from hypnotic  sleep, the so-called post-hypnotic suggestion. As a matter of course,  just these have an eminent value for psychotherapy. I may suggest to-day  that the subject will overcome to-morrow his desire for the morphine  injection, or that he will feel to-night the restfulness which will  overcome his insomnia. But if the suggestion of an idea means belief,  and if belief means a preparation for action, we have indeed no new  factor before us if the action for which we prepare the subject is from  the start related to a definite time. If we do not link it with the  consciousness of a special time or of a special occasion which will  occur later, the suggestion soon fades away. That my library is an  orchard is forgotten perhaps within ten minutes, if I have not come back  to it in the conversation. But if I say that after awaking as soon as I  shall knock on my desk three times, you will be in the orchard again,  the psychophysical apparatus is prepared, a new setting has set in, the  three knocks will bring about the complete transformation. In short the  difficulties disappear as soon as we are consistent in interpreting all  suggestive influences as changes in the motor setting and as the result  of the antagonistic character of all of our motor paths.    We say the difficulties disappear. Of course, that is meant in a  relative sense only. It means essentially that we are able to bring the  complex state of hypnotism down to the similar state of attention and  motor adjustment, but of course we must not forget that we are far from  a satisfactory explanation of the process in attention itself. We know  that the opening of motor channels in one direction somewhat closes the  channels for discharge in the opposite direction, but what mechanism  does that work is still very obscure. Whichever principle of  hypothetical explanation we might prefer, it certainly leads to  difficulties in view of the extreme complexity of attention in states of  suggestion and hypnotism. We might think of a mechanism which through  the medium of the finest blood-vessels should produce a localized anaemia  in those centers which lead to the antagonistic action. Or we might  fancy that by extremely subtle machinery the resistance is increased in  those tissues which lie between the various neurons, or we might even  think of toxic and antitoxic processes in the cerebral regions; and any  day may open entirely new ways of explanation. We may add that even if  the mechanism of attention were completely explained, we are also still  far from understanding the physiological changes which go on in the  sphere of the blood-vessels or of the glands and the internal organs. We  understand easily that the idea of the subject that he cannot move his  arm keeps the arm stiff; but that his idea to blush really dilates the  blood-vessels of his cheek is much less open to our causal  understanding; still less that in very exceptional cases perhaps a part  of the skin becomes inflamed, if we make believe that we touch it with a  glowing iron. And yet here too we see that we move in the same direction  and that we have to explain these exceptional and bewildering results by  comparing them with the simpler and simpler forms, that the process of  attention contains all the germs for the whole development.    In claiming that hypnotism depends upon the over-attention to the  hypnotizing person, we admit that the increased suggestibility belongs  entirely to suggestions which come from without. Only that which at  least takes its starting point from the words or the movements of the  hypnotizer finds over-sensitive suggestibility. Ideas which arise merely  from the associations of the subject himself have no especially  favorable chance for acceptance. But surely we also know states in which  the suggestibility for certain of one's own ideas is abnormally  increased. Great individual differences exist in that respect in normal  life. There are normal hypochondriacs who believe that they feel the  symptoms of widely different diseases under the influence of their own  ideas, and others who are torturing themselves with fears on account of  unjustified beliefs. But the abnormal increase of suggestibility  parallel to that of hypnotism for suggestions from without exists for  suggestions from within, mainly in nervous diseases, especially in  neurasthenic, hysteric, and psychasthenic states. Within certain limits,  we might almost say that this increase of suggestibility for  autosuggestion is the fundamental characteristic of these diseases, just  as increase of suggestibility for heterosuggestions characterizes  hypnotism.    Especially in earlier times, the theory was often proposed that hypnosis  is an artificial hysteria. Such a view is untenable to-day; but that  hysteria too shows abundant effects of increased suggestibility is  correctly indicated by such a theory. The hysteric patient may by any  chance pick up the idea that her right arm is paralyzed or is  anaesthetic and the idea at once transforms itself into a belief and the  belief clings to her like an obsession and produces the effect that she  is unable to move the arm or that she does not feel a pinprick on the  skin. These autosuggestions may take a firmer hold of the mind than any  suggestions from without, but surely such openness to selfimplanted  beliefs must be acknowledged as symptomatic of disease, while hypnosis  with its impositions can be broken off at any moment and thus should no  more be classed among the diseases than are sleep and dreams. The  hysteric or psychasthenic autosuggestion resists the mere will of  breaking it off. Here, therefore, is the classical ground for strong  mental counterinfluences, that is, for psychotherapeutic treatment.  Experience shows that the strongest chance for the development of such  autosuggestive beliefs exists wherever an"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22776"],[0,"From a Terrace in Prague (#20)"],[1," shield the heraldic emblems with which it was charged. Lions and bears,  rampant, couchant, gardant, and other fauna in becoming attitudes,  bends, bars, engrailed, dancetty, raguly, gules, azure, argent or  otherwise--all these things of beauty vanished from Dalibor's scutcheon  while the assembled multitude wondered \"What next?\" Thereupon Dalibor  held forth, in impressive manner and impassioned tones, on the iniquity  of the system, the inequality of condition, under which they were all  forced to exist. Having made his assembled fellow-men his equals by  removing the aforesaid heraldic devices, he would further show his sense  of equality by leading them in person and on foot to real freedom; so  said Dalibor. Thereupon the multitude, at Dalibor's heels, set off down  the hill and started spreading equality all around them. Their method  was quite simple, indeed it lacked originality: they just helped  themselves to the goods of those who happened to live by the way. Those  who failed to rise to this lofty conception of Dalibor and his comrades  were knocked on the head--also quite a simple and homely method of  appeal; and so this happy band of pilgrims left behind them a dead-level  of equality. These their efforts at social regeneration, their  illustration of economic principles, were not appreciated. Dalibor was  captured and invited to take up his residence beneath the trap-door of  the tower that was henceforth to be known by his name.    As soon as he was safely housed, Rumour, the mother of Legend, got busy  about him. Folk began to whisper to each other the news that wonderful  music was heard proceeding from out of the stern walls of Dalibor's  prison; the sound of a violin was heard by the many who were attracted  to the spot by Rumour. No doubt Dalibor learnt to play the violin: the  Czech is so intensely musical that he will master any instrument before  he has got the hang of the grammar of his own language, the fiddle is so  much easier. The strange thing is that the musical performance continued  long after Dalibor's death--here Legend steps in with the assertion that  an angel, a fairy, or at least some sort of supernatural being, is  continuing Dalibor's programme.    [Illustration: A TOWER OF THE HRAD[vC]ANY.]    There were many other visitors to Daliborka, and in course of time the  lower stratum of the tower filled up with human relics. As the defunct  visitors were mostly Czechs, and therefore full of music, I should think  that they could form at least a string quartette--it only requires a  little enterprise and a good strong medium. I make a present of this  suggestion to the Prague Society for Psychical Research, if there be  one.    Prague must have been a fair city in those days when Ottokar II rode out  of the gate to meet Rudolph of Habsburg. Although the ban of the Empire  and the interdict of the Church were upon their King, the people of  Prague, clergy and laymen, accompanied him to the city gate with prayers  and tears. When news of his death came to Prague the bells of one  hundred churches tolled out on that 26th of August, the Feast of St.  Rufus, a day destined to be of ill-omen to Bohemia's Kings.           *       *       *       *       *    The shadow of the hand of Habsburg hung darkly over the southern  frontiers of Bohemia. Rudolph, the first Habsburg Emperor, began the  famous tactics of his house, gaining power by matrimonial alliances. His  son Rudolph was to marry Agnes, daughter of Ottokar II, whose son  Wenceslaus II was to marry Gutta, the Emperor's daughter.    Wenceslaus II was a minor when he succeeded his father, and suffered  considerably under his guardian and cousin Otto of Brandenburg, who, in  pursuit of an all-German policy, even imprisoned the young King. Anarchy  reigned in Bohemia when young Wenceslaus, at the age of twelve,  nominally assumed the reins of government. The actual ruler of the  country, however, was Zavis of Falckenstein, an able man but of doubtful  morality; there was some unsavoury story concerning him and Ottokar's  widow Kunhuta, whom Zavis eventually married. Then again the young King  had Zavis done to death in treacherous manner, while the condition of  Bohemia as an ordered State went from bad to worse. Strange to relate,  the country flourished economically--became, indeed, very  prosperous--the increase of wealth being largely due to the fact that  workings on the silver mines at Kutna Hora had been resumed. Towards the  end of the reign of this Wenceslaus, whose rule was mild, matters  improved somewhat. Bohemia became a sort of city of refuge, and  neighbouring States, Hungary and Poland, being in a worse state of  anarchy than any others, invited King Wenceslaus to reign over them.  Bohemia and Poland thus became united for a while under one ruler,  Wenceslaus, who had himself crowned King of the latter country at  Gnesen. Hungary was given in charge of the King's son Wenceslaus, who  was crowned as King of that country and resided some time at Ofen.  Wenceslaus had taken a Polish Princess to wife after the death of Gutta,  and had thus reinforced his connection with a Slavonic neighbour, but  Germanism was in the ascendant in Bohemia and the hand of Habsburg was  stretched out over it. It was yet some centuries before the power of the  Habsburg should become absolute in the lands of the P[vr]emysl dynasty,  but that family's light was nearing extinction. Whether good or bad, the  rulers who sprang from the soil, from the peasant stock of Libu[vs]a's  choosing, had been of the people and had on the whole served their  people's interests. With Wenceslaus III murdered by an unknown assassin  while on his way to Poland, the male line of the P[vr]emysl dynasty died  out. It continued in the indirect line by the marriage of Elizabeth,  daughter of Wenceslaus II, with Rudolph, a grandson of the Habsburg who  dealt the death-blow to Bohemia's native rulers.    Whether for good or evil, alien influence was working strongly in  Bohemia, and notably in Prague. Ottokar II had encouraged it as part of  his policy towards keeping in check his turbulent nobles and towards  raising up a reliable middle class. His nobles aided towards his  downfall by their treachery, and the middle class of Prague, though  loyal to the Crown, was alive chiefly to its own interests. Perhaps that  foreign influence was weaving its spell over the burghers of Prague, a  spell to which the Slav is somewhat susceptible.    During the reign of the last P[vr]emysl sovereigns Prague offered the  spectacle of a rich and prosperous city, but its brightness was rather  that of lights round the bier of some illustrious dead. Many foreigners  found themselves attracted to the capital of Bohemia during this  period, among them some ardent souls who were to be found doing good,  according to their lights, in other cities of Europe, namely, Irish  monks. It is of interest to us to note that these monks were frequently  called Scots: you will find traces of them under that designation in the  Schotten Kirche at Ratisbon and the Schotten Ring in Vienna. In Prague  they were recognized as Irish, and their name lives on in the Hybernska  Ulice in the Old Town. A church, with an altar dedicated to St. Patrick,  arose at the corner of that street by the cross-roads, under the hands  of Irish monks; a church now used for secular purposes, and built over  the original edifice, stands there still. Amidst all the turmoil of this  busy centre of the city you may still in those small hours of the  morning when the traffic dies down for a while pick up an echo or two of  the voices of those zealous Irishmen, but you must listen with all your  soul, for those sounds are very elusive. Again, looking out over the  city from my terrace I notice a copper dome just across the Charles  Bridge, a dome flanked by high towers, and all bearing the unmistakable  mark of Jesuit architecture. Yet that building, now used as part of the  University, recalls memories of pious souls who came to Prague at the  invitation of P[vr]emysl Ottokar II. These were the Knights Crucifer, or  the Cruciferous Knights as the guide-book prefers to call them. Their  Order, the members of which always carried a cross in the left hand, was  founded by St. Cletus; their work was to tend the sick and offer  hospitality to pilgrims. The Order went down on the death of the founder  and sought refuge in Palestine, where St. Cyriak discovered it, reformed  it, and eventually brought it to Rome. This is said to have happened in  the latter half of the fourth century, but I should think the date  extremely uncertain; nor does it matter much. The Order received new  rules in the twelfth century from Pope Alexander III, who, being on good  terms with Ottakar II at the time, allowed the Order to be transplanted  to Prague. I do not in the least know what the good knights did all  those years between their installation at Prague in 1256 and the  dissolution of their Order in 1783. Anyone who wants to know may no  doubt find records of their doings, which were probably concerned with  adding up quarterings and deciding questions of etiquette. Still their  name, Knights Crucifex, lingers round one of the most picturesque  corners of Prague, under the shadow of a stately Gothic tower which  silently but insistently claims reverence above the _baroque_ structures  of a later non-Bohemian age. It is just at this spot, with its lingering  memories of Queen Judith, of P[vr]emysl Ottokar and a yet greater King  of Bohemia of whom I shall tell you shortly, that you realize how Prague  is that Golden City of the days of glorious Gothic and the Renaissance,  and not of the _baroque_ superimposed by the Jesuits after Bohemia's  glory had departed on the gentle slopes of the White Mountain.
