Thread is used in some kinds of weaving,  but its principal use is for sewing, for which purpose it is composed  of either silk, cotton, or flax. Thread made of silk is technically  known as sewing silk; that made of flax is known as linen thread;  while cotton thread intended for sewing is commonly called spool  cotton. These distinctions, while generally observed by trade, are not  always maintained by the public.    The spool cotton of to-day is of a different grade from that made  before the sewing machine came into general use. The early thread was  but three cord, and contained such a large number of knots, thin  places, etc., that it could not be worked satisfactorily on the  machines, so manufacturers were called upon to produce a thread that  would be of the same thickness in every twist. This was effected by  making the thread of six cords instead of three, thereby producing a  smoother and more uniform strand.    =Manufacturing Processes.= The raw cotton for the manufacture of  thread must be of long staple. If the fiber is short the thread made  of it will be weak, and hence unsuited for the purposes required of  it. Ordinary cotton is not adapted to the manufacture of the better  grades of spool cotton on account of the shortness of its fiber.  Egyptian and Sea Island cotton are used because they have a much  longer fiber and are softer in texture. The raw cotton comes to the  factory packed in great bales, and is usually stored away for some  months before it is used. The first step in the conversion of the bale  of cotton into thread consists in giving the fiber a thorough  cleaning. This is accomplished by feeding it to a series of pickers  which pull the matted locks and wads to shreds, beat out the dirt and  seeds, and roll the cotton in the form of batting upon cylinders until  it issues from the finisher lap machines as a downy roll or lap.    The lap of cotton then goes to the carding rooms, where it is combed  into parallel fibers by means of a revolving cylinder covered with  fine wire teeth, sometimes 90,000 of them to the square foot. On  leaving the carding machines the lap has become a gossamer-like web  thirty-nine inches broad. This web is next passed through a small  \"eye\" which condenses it into a narrow band about an inch in width,  known as the sliver. By this time the fiber has been so drawn out that  one yard of the original lap has become 360 yards of the sliver. The  sliver now looks almost perfect, but if it were spun it would not make  good thread. It is necessary to lay every fiber as nearly parallel as  possible, so that there will be an equal number of fibers in the  strand per inch. Besides this, the remaining dirt and short fibers  must be removed and the knots and kinks in the fibers straightened  out. To accomplish these objects the cotton must be \"combed.\" First,  the slivers are passed through several sets of rollers, each set  moving faster than the preceding, so that the strands are drawn out  fine and thin. In this condition the cotton passes to a doubling  frame, and from thence to the lapping frame, a device combining six  laps into one and drawing the whole out into one fine, delicate, ropy  lap.    [Illustration: WARP ROOM      1. Beam on which the warp is wound.    2. Warp.    3. Creel.    4. Spools in the creel.]    The comber now takes the lap and combs out all the impurities and  short fibers, at a sacrifice of about one-fifth of the material; next,  it combines six of these fluffy combed rolls of fiber into one. A  number of these rolls are then drawn out by another machine twelve  times as long as they were before and twisted together on a slubbing  frame. This last drawing reduces the roll to about the thickness of  zephyr yarn. After being further doubled and twisted, the yarn, or  roll, is ready for the mule spinner, which accomplishes by means of  hundreds of spindles and wheels what the housewife once did with her  spinning wheel. The mule, however, does the work of more than 1,000  hand spinners and takes up much less space. On this machine 900  spindles take the yarn from 1,800 bobbins, and by means of  accelerating rollers and a carriage draw out and twist it to the  proper fineness for the size of thread wanted. Having passed through  the complex processes of cleansing, combing, drawing, and spinning,  the cotton is now in the form of yarn of various sizes, and the real  work of thread making, which is a distinct art from yarn making,  begins.    The thread-making process is briefly as follows: The yarn is doubled  and twisted; then three of such yarns are twisted together, which give  the six-fold combination for six-cord thread. For a three-cord thread  three yarns are twisted together. After the twisting is completed the  thread is reeled into skeins having a continuous length of 4,000 to  12,000 yards, according to the size, and is then sent to the  examining department where it is rigidly inspected. Every strand is  looked over, and any found to be defective are laid aside, so that  when the thread is put on the market it shall be as perfect as care  and skill can make it.    At this stage of the work the skeins of thread are of the pale cream  color common to all unbleached cotton goods, and are technically known  as \"in the gray.\" They therefore have to be bleached pure white or  dyed in fast colors. The skeins, whether intended for white or colored  thread, are first placed in large, steam-tight iron tanks and boiled.  Here the thread remains subjected to a furious boiling for six or  seven hours; when removed it is perfectly clean, but still retains the  brownish gray color of unbleached cotton. It then goes into a bath of  chloride of lime and is bleached as white as snow. The skeins are next  drawn through an acid solution to neutralize the chloride. Another  boiling, another bleaching, a bath of soapsuds, and the final rinsing,  complete the cleansing and whitening process. Those skeins intended  for colored threads are taken to the dyeing room and placed in tanks  filled with suitably prepared dyeing solutions.    [Illustration: TWISTING ROOM      1. Humidifier.    2. Twister machine.    3. Boxes containing spools of cotton, ready to be put in creel and       form warp.]    From the bleaching and dyeing departments the skeins of thread go  back to the mill to be wound on the bobbins, and from the bobbins  finally on the small wooden spools. The automatic winding machines can  be regulated to wind any given number of yards. The small spools are  fastened on pivots, the thread from the bobbins fastened on the  spools, and the machines set in motion. At the required number of  yards the spools stop revolving. The ordinary spool of cotton thread  contains 200 yards, and when this has been wound on, the thread is cut  with a knife by an attendant, who also cuts the little nick in the rim  of the spool and fastens therein the end of the thread. Thread mills  commonly print their own labels, and these are affixed to the spools  by special machinery with remarkable rapidity. From the labeling  machine the spools go to an inspector, who examines each one for  imperfections, and any that are found faulty are discarded. When  packed in pasteboard boxes or in cabinets the thread is ready for  market.    =Thread Numbers.= Spool cotton for ordinary use is made in sizes  ranging from No. 8 coarse to No. 200 fine. In cotton yarn numbering,  the fineness of the spun strand is denoted by the number of hanks,  each containing 840 yards, which are required to weigh one pound, as  illustrated in the following table:     When   1 hank of cotton yarn (   840 yds.) weigh 1 lb. it is No.   1    \"    10   \"   \"    \"     \"  ( 8,400 yds.)   \"    \"      \"    \"   10    \"    16   \"   \"    \"     \"  (13,440 yds.)   \"    \"      \"    \"   16    \"    30   \"   \"    \"     \"  (25,200 yds.)   \"    \"      \"    \"   30    \"    50   \"   \"    \"     \"  (42,000 yds.)   \"    \"      \"    \"   50    \"   100   \"   \"    \"     \"  (84,000 yds.)   \"    \"      \"    \"  100    The early manufactured thread was three cord, and took its number from  the size of the yarn from which it was made. No. 60 yarn made No. 60  thread, though in point of fact the actual caliber of No. 60 thread  would equal No. 20 yarn, being three No. 60 strands combined  together. When the sewing machine came into the market as the great  consumer of thread, spool cotton had to be made a smoother and more  even product than had previously been necessary for hand needles. This  was accomplished by using six strands instead of three, the yarns  being twice as fine. As thread numbers were already established, they  were not altered for the new article, and consequently at the present  time No. 60 six-cord, for example, and No. 60 three-cord are identical  in size, though in reality No. 60 six-cord is formed of No. 120 yarns.  It is relatively smoother, more even, and stronger than the three-cord  grade. All sizes of six-cord threads are made of six strands, each of  the latter being twice as fine as the number of the thread as  designated by the label. Three-cord spool cotton is made of three  strands of yarn, each of the same number as the thread.    =Sizing.= In textile manufacturing, sizing is the process of  strengthening warp yarns by coating them with a preparation of starch,  flour, etc., in order that they may withstand the weaving process  without chafing or breaking. The operation of sizing is also often  resorted to in finishing certain classes of cotton and linen fabrics,  which are sized or dressed with various mixtures in order to create an  appearance of weight and strength where these qualities do not exist,  or, if present, only in a small degree. The object in sizing warp yarn  before weaving is to enable that process to be performed with the  minimum of threads breaking. Judicious sizing adds to the strength of  the yarn"]]]
