Nay, but, it is perhaps answered me, not by an  ordinary observer; a person ignorant of the nature of alabaster might  perhaps fancy all these symmetrical patterns to have been found in the  stone itself, and thus be doubly deceived, supposing blocks to be solid  and symmetrical which were in reality subdivided and irregular. I grant  it; but be it remembered, that in all things, ignorance is liable to be  deceived, and has no right to accuse anything but itself as the source  of the deception. The style and the words are dishonest, not which are  liable to be misunderstood if subjected to no inquiry, but which are  deliberately calculated to lead inquiry astray. There are perhaps no  great or noble truths, from those of religion downwards, which present  no mistakeable aspect to casual or ignorant contemplation. Both the  truth and the lie agree in hiding themselves at first, but the lie  continues to hide itself with effort, as we approach to examine it; and  leads us, if undiscovered, into deeper lies; the truth reveals itself in  proportion to our patience and knowledge, discovers itself kindly to our  pleading, and leads us, as it is discovered, into deeper truths.    Sec. XXXVII. LAW VI. _The decoration must be shallow in cutting._ The  method of construction being thus systematized, it is evident that a  certain style of decoration must arise out of it, based on the primal  condition that over the greater part of the edifice there can be _no  deep cutting_. The thin sheets of covering stones do not admit of it; we  must not cut them through to the bricks; and whatever ornaments we  engrave upon them cannot, therefore, be more than an inch deep at the  utmost. Consider for an instant the enormous differences which this  single condition compels between the sculptural decoration of the  incrusted style, and that of the solid stones of the North, which may be  hacked and hewn into whatever cavernous hollows and black recesses we  choose; struck into grim darknesses and grotesque projections, and  rugged ploughings up of sinuous furrows, in which any form or thought  may be wrought out on any scale,--mighty statues with robes of rock and  crowned foreheads burning in the sun, or venomous goblins and stealthy  dragons shrunk into lurking-places of untraceable shade: think of this,  and of the play and freedom given to the sculptor's hand and temper, to  smite out and in, hither and thither, as he will; and then consider what  must be the different spirit of the design which is to be wrought on  the smooth surface of a film of marble, where every line and shadow must  be drawn with the most tender pencilling and cautious reserve of  resource,--where even the chisel must not strike hard, lest it break  through the delicate stone, nor the mind be permitted in any impetuosity  of conception inconsistent with the fine discipline of the hand.  Consider that whatever animal or human form is to be suggested, must be  projected on a flat surface; that all the features of the countenance,  the folds of the drapery, the involutions of the limbs, must be so  reduced and subdued that the whole work becomes rather a piece of fine  drawing than of sculpture; and then follow out, until you begin to  perceive their endlessness, the resulting differences of character which  will be necessitated in every part of the ornamental designs of these  incrusted churches, as compared with that of the Northern schools. I  shall endeavor to trace a few of them only.    Sec. XXXVIII. The first would of course be a diminution of the builder's  dependence upon human form as a source of ornament: since exactly in  proportion to the dignity of the form itself is the loss which it must  sustain in being reduced to a shallow and linear bas-relief, as well as  the difficulty of expressing it at all under such conditions. Wherever  sculpture can be solid, the nobler characters of the human form at once  lead the artist to aim at its representation, rather than at that of  inferior organisms; but when all is to be reduced to outline, the forms  of flowers and lower animals are always more intelligible, and are felt  to approach much more to a satisfactory rendering of the objects  intended, than the outlines of the human body. This inducement to seek  for resources of ornament in the lower fields of creation was powerless  in the minds of the great Pagan nations, Ninevite, Greek, or Egyptian:  first, because their thoughts were so concentrated on their own  capacities and fates, that they preferred the rudest suggestion of human  form to the best of an inferior organism; secondly, because their  constant practice in solid sculpture, often colossal, enabled them to  bring a vast amount of science into the treatment of the lines, whether  of the low relief, the monochrome vase, or shallow hieroglyphic.    Sec. XXXIX. But when various ideas adverse to the representation of  animal, and especially of human, form, originating with the Arabs and  iconoclast Greeks, had begun at any rate to direct the builders' minds  to seek for decorative materials in inferior types, and when diminished  practice in solid sculpture had rendered it more difficult to find artists  capable of satisfactorily reducing the high organisms to their elementary  outlines, the choice of subject for surface sculpture would be more and  more uninterruptedly directed to floral organisms, and human and animal  form would become diminished in size, frequency, and general importance.  So that, while in the Northern solid architecture we constantly find the  effect of its noblest features dependent on ranges of statues, often  colossal, and full of abstract interest, independent of their  architectural service, in the Southern incrusted style we must expect to  find the human form for the most part subordinate and diminutive, and  involved among designs of foliage and flowers, in the manner of which  endless examples had been furnished by the fantastic ornamentation of  the Romans, from which the incrusted style had been directly derived.    Sec. XL. Farther. In proportion to the degree in which his subject must  be reduced to abstract outline will be the tendency in the sculptor to  abandon naturalism of representation, and subordinate every form to  architectural service. Where the flower or animal can be hewn into bold  relief, there will always be a temptation to render the representation  of it more complete than is necessary, or even to introduce details and  intricacies inconsistent with simplicity of distant effect. Very often a  worse fault than this is committed; and in the endeavor to give vitality  to the stone, the original ornamental purpose of the design is  sacrificed or forgotten. But when nothing of this kind can be attempted,  and a slight outline is all that the sculptor can command, we may  anticipate that this outline will be composed with exquisite grace; and  that the richness of its ornamental arrangement will atone for the  feebleness of its power of portraiture. On the porch of a Northern  cathedral we may seek for the images of the flowers that grow in the  neighboring fields, and as we watch with wonder the grey stones that  fret themselves into thorns, and soften into blossoms, we may care  little that these knots of ornament, as we retire from them to  contemplate the whole building, appear unconsidered or confused. On the  incrusted building we must expect no such deception of the eye or  thoughts. It may sometimes be difficult to determine, from the  involutions of its linear sculpture, what were the natural forms which  originally suggested them: but we may confidently expect that the grace  of their arrangement will always be complete; that there will not be a  line in them which could be taken away without injury, nor one wanting  which could be added with advantage.    Sec. XLI. Farther. While the sculptures of the incrusted school will thus  be generally distinguished by care and purity rather than force, and  will be, for the most part, utterly wanting in depth of shadow, there  will be one means of obtaining darkness peculiarly simple and obvious,  and often in the sculptor's power. Wherever he can, without danger,  leave a hollow behind his covering slabs, or use them, like glass, to  fill an aperture in the wall, he can, by piercing them with holes,  obtain points or spaces of intense blackness to contrast with the light  tracing of the rest of his design. And we may expect to find this  artifice used the more extensively, because, while it will be an  effective means of ornamentation on the exterior of the building, it  will be also the safest way of admitting light to the interior, still  totally excluding both rain and wind. And it will naturally follow that  the architect, thus familiarized with the effect of black and sudden  points of shadow, will often seek to carry the same principle into other  portions of his ornamentation, and by deep drill-holes, or perhaps  inlaid portions of black color, to refresh the eye where it may be  wearied by the lightness of the general handling.    Sec. XLII. Farther. Exactly in proportion to the degree in which the force  of sculpture is subdued, will be the importance attached to color as a  means of effect or constituent of beauty. I have above stated that the  incrusted style was the only one in which perfect or permanent color  decoration was _possible_. It is also the only one in which a true  system of color decoration was ever likely to be invented. In order to  understand this, the reader must permit me to review with some care the  nature of the principles of coloring adopted by the Northern and  Southern nations.    Sec. XLIII. I believe that from the beginning of the world there has never  been a true or fine school of art in which color was despised. It has  often been imperfectly attained and injudiciously applied, but I believe  it to be"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30756"],[0,"The Stones of Venice, Volume 3 (of 3) (#20)"],[1," part of clay, with the  immobility of the one, and the foulness of the other, double chinned,  blunt-mouthed, bony-cheeked, with its brows drawn down into meagre lines  and wrinkles over the eyelids; the face of a man incapable either of joy  or sorrow, unless such as may be caused by the indulgence of passion, or  the mortification of pride. Even had he been such a one, a noble workman  would not have written it so legibly on his tomb; and I believe it to be  the image of the carver's own mind that is there hewn in the marble, not  that of the Doge Foscari. For the same mind is visible enough  throughout, the traces of it mingled with those of the evil taste of the  whole time and people. There is not anything so small but it is shown in  some portion of its treatment; for instance, in the placing of the  shields at the back of the great curtain. In earlier times, the shield,  as we have seen, was represented as merely suspended against the tomb by  a thong, or if sustained in any other manner, still its form was simple  and undisguised. Men in those days used their shields in war, and  therefore there was no need to add dignity to their form by external  ornament. That which, through day after day of mortal danger, had borne  back from them the waves of battle, could neither be degraded by  simplicity, nor exalted by decoration. By its rude leathern thong it  seemed to be fastened to their tombs, and the shield of the mighty was  not cast away, though capable of defending its master no more.    Sec. LXXV. It was otherwise in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.  The changed system of warfare was rapidly doing away with the practical  service of the shield; and the chiefs who directed the battle from a  distance, or who passed the greater part of their lives in the  council-chamber, soon came to regard the shield as nothing more than a  field for their armorial bearings. It then became a principal object of  their Pride of State to increase the conspicuousness of these marks of  family distinction by surrounding them with various and fantastic  ornament, generally scroll or flower work, which of course deprived the  shield of all appearance of being intended for a soldier's use. Thus the  shield of the Foscari is introduced in two ways. On the sarcophagus,  the bearings are three times repeated, enclosed in circular disks, which  are sustained each by a couple of naked infants. Above the canopy, two  shields of the usual form are set in the centre of circles filled by a  radiating ornament of shell flutings, which give them the effect of  ventilators; and their circumference is farther adorned by gilt rays,  undulating to represent a glory.    Sec. LXXVI. We now approach that period of the early Renaissance which  was noticed in the preceding chapter as being at first a very visible  improvement on the corrupted Gothic. The tombs executed during the  period of the Byzantine Renaissance exhibit, in the first place, a  consummate skill in handling the chisel, perfect science of drawing and  anatomy, high appreciation of good classical models, and a grace of  composition and delicacy of ornament derived, I believe, principally  from the great Florentine sculptors. But, together with this science,  they exhibit also, for a short time, some return to the early religious  feeling, forming a school of sculpture which corresponds to that of the  school of the Bellini in painting; and the only wonder is that there  should not have been more workmen in the fifteenth century doing in  marble what Perugino, Francia, and Bellini did on canvas. There are,  indeed, some few, as I have just said, in whom the good and pure temper  shows itself: but the sculptor was necessarily led sooner than the  painter to an exclusive study of classical models, utterly adverse to  the Christian imagination; and he was also deprived of the great  purifying and sacred element of color, besides having much more of  merely mechanical and therefore degrading labor to go through in the  realization of his thought. Hence I do not know any example in sculpture  at this period, at least in Venice, which has not conspicuous faults  (not faults of imperfection, as in early sculpture, but of purpose and  sentiment), staining such beauties as it may possess; and the whole  school soon falls away, and merges into vain pomp and meagre metaphor.    Sec. LXXVII. The most celebrated monument of this period is that to the  Doge Andrea Vendramin, in the Church of St. John and Paul, sculptured  about 1480, and before alluded to in the first chapter of the first  volume. It has attracted public admiration, partly by its costliness,  partly by the delicacy and precision of its chiselling; being otherwise  a very base and unworthy example of the school, and showing neither  invention nor feeling. It has the Virtues, as usual, dressed like  heathen goddesses, and totally devoid of expression, though graceful and  well studied merely as female figures. The rest of its sculpture is all  of the same kind; perfect in workmanship, and devoid of thought. Its  dragons are covered with marvellous scales, but have no terror nor sting  in them; its birds are perfect in plumage, but have no song in them; its  children lovely of limb, but have no childishness in them.    Sec. LXXVIII. Of far other workmanship are the tombs of Pietro and  Giovanni Mocenigo, in St. John and Paul, and of Pietro Bernardo in the  Frari; in all which the details are as full of exquisite fancy, as they  are perfect in execution; and in the two former, and several others of  similar feeling, the old religious symbols return; the Madonna is again  seen enthroned under the canopy, and the sarcophagus is decorated with  legends of the saints. But the fatal errors of sentiment are,  nevertheless, always traceable. In the first place, the sculptor is  always seen to be intent upon the exhibition of his skill, more than on  producing any effect on the spectator's mind; elaborate backgrounds of  landscape, with tricks of perspective, imitations of trees, clouds, and  water, and various other unnecessary adjuncts, merely to show how marble  could be subdued; together with useless under-cutting, and over-finish  in subordinate parts, continually exhibiting the same cold vanity and  unexcited precision of mechanism. In the second place, the figures have  all the peculiar tendency to posture-making, which, exhibiting itself  first painfully in Perugino, rapidly destroyed the veracity of  composition in all art. By posture-making I mean, in general, that  action of figures which results from the painter's considering, in the  first place, not how, under the circumstances, they would actually have  walked, or stood, or looked, but how they may most gracefully and  harmoniously walk or stand. In the hands of a great man, posture, like  everything else, becomes noble, even when over-studied, as with Michael  Angelo, who was, perhaps, more than any other, the cause of the  mischief; but, with inferior men, this habit of composing attitudes ends  necessarily in utter lifelessness and abortion. Giotto was, perhaps, of  all painters, the most free from the infection of the poison, always  conceiving an incident naturally, and drawing it unaffectedly; and the  absence of posture-making in the works of the Pre-Raphaelites, as  opposed to the Attitudinarianism of the modern school, has been both one  of their principal virtues, and of the principal causes of outcry  against them.    Sec. LXXIX. But the most significant change in the treatment of these  tombs, with respect to our immediate object, is in the form of the  sarcophagus. It was above noted, that, exactly in proportion to the  degree of the pride of life expressed in any monument, would be also the  fear of death; and therefore, as these tombs increase in splendor, in  size, and beauty of workmanship, we perceive a gradual desire to _take  away from the definite character of the sarcophagus_. In the earliest  times, as we have seen, it was a gloomy mass of stone; gradually it  became charged with religious sculpture; but never with the slightest  desire to disguise its form, until towards the middle of the fifteenth  century. It then becomes enriched with flower-work and hidden by the  Virtues; and, finally, losing its foursquare form, it is modelled on  graceful types of ancient vases, made as little like a coffin as  possible, and refined away in various elegancies, till it becomes, at  last, a mere pedestal or stage for the portrait statue. This statue, in  the meantime, has been gradually coming back to life, through a curious  series of transitions. The Vendramin monument is one of the last which  shows, or pretends to show, the recumbent figure laid in death. A few  years later, this idea became disagreeable to polite minds; and, lo! the  figures which before had been laid at rest upon the tomb pillow, raised  themselves on their elbows, and began to look round them. The soul of  the sixteenth century dared not contemplate its body in death.    Sec. LXXX. The reader cannot but remember many instances of this form of  monument, England being peculiarly rich in examples of them; although,  with her, tomb sculpture, after the fourteenth century, is altogether  imitative, and in no degree indicative of the temper of the people. It  was from Italy that the authority for the change was derived; and in  Italy only, therefore, that it is truly correspondent to the change in  the national mind. There are many monuments in Venice of this  semi-animate type, most of them carefully sculptured, and some very  admirable as portraits, and for the casting of the drapery, especially  those in the Church of San Salvador; but I shall only direct the reader  to one, that of Jacopo Pesaro, Bishop of Paphos, in the Church of the  Frari; notable not only as a very skilful piece of sculpture, but for  the epitaph, singularly characteristic of the period, and confirmatory  of "]]]
