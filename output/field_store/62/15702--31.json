But, while  he was talking with his venerable host, and thanking him for his kind  attentions, Emily observed his countenance change, and, before she could  reach him, he fell back in his chair. In a few moments he recovered from  the sudden faintness that had come over him, but felt so ill, that  he perceived himself unable to set out, and, having remained a little  while, struggling against the pressure of indisposition, he begged he  might be helped up stairs to bed. This request renewed all the terror  which Emily had suffered on the preceding evening; but, though scarcely  able to support herself, under the sudden shock it gave her, she tried  to conceal her apprehensions from St. Aubert, and gave her trembling arm  to assist him to the door of his chamber.    When he was once more in bed, he desired that Emily, who was then  weeping in her own room, might be called; and, as she came, he waved his  hand for every other person to quit the apartment. When they were alone,  he held out his hand to her, and fixed his eyes upon her countenance,  with an expression so full of tenderness and grief, that all her  fortitude forsook her, and she burst into an agony of tears. St. Aubert  seemed struggling to acquire firmness, but was still unable to speak; he  could only press her hand, and check the tears that stood trembling in  his eyes. At length he commanded his voice, 'My dear child,' said he,  trying to smile through his anguish, 'my dear Emily!'--and paused again.  He raised his eyes to heaven, as if in prayer, and then, in a firmer  tone, and with a look, in which the tenderness of the father was  dignified by the pious solemnity of the saint, he said, 'My dear child,  I would soften the painful truth I have to tell you, but I find myself  quite unequal to the art. Alas! I would, at this moment, conceal it from  you, but that it would be most cruel to deceive you. It cannot be  long before we must part; let us talk of it, that our thoughts and our  prayers may prepare us to bear it.' His voice faltered, while Emily,  still weeping, pressed his hand close to her heart, which swelled with a  convulsive sigh, but she could not look up.    'Let me not waste these moments,' said St. Aubert, recovering himself,  'I have much to say. There is a circumstance of solemn consequence,  which I have to mention, and a solemn promise to obtain from you; when  this is done I shall be easier. You have observed, my dear, how anxious  I am to reach home, but know not all my reasons for this. Listen to what  I am going to say.--Yet stay--before I say more give me this promise, a  promise made to your dying father!'--St. Aubert was interrupted; Emily,  struck by his last words, as if for the first time, with a conviction of  his immediate danger, raised her head; her tears stopped, and, gazing  at him for a moment with an expression of unutterable anguish, a slight  convulsion seized her, and she sunk senseless in her chair. St.  Aubert's cries brought La Voisin and his daughter to the room, and  they administered every means in their power to restore her, but, for a  considerable time, without effect. When she recovered, St. Aubert was so  exhausted by the scene he had witnessed, that it was many minutes  before he had strength to speak; he was, however, somewhat revived by  a cordial, which Emily gave him; and, being again alone with her, he  exerted himself to tranquilize her spirits, and to offer her all the  comfort of which her situation admitted. She threw herself into his  arms, wept on his neck, and grief made her so insensible to all he said,  that he ceased to offer the alleviations, which he himself could not, at  this moment, feel, and mingled his silent tears with hers. Recalled, at  length, to a sense of duty, she tried to spare her father from a farther  view of her suffering; and, quitting his embrace, dried her tears,  and said something, which she meant for consolation. 'My dear Emily,'  replied St. Aubert, 'my dear child, we must look up with humble  confidence to that Being, who has protected and comforted us in every  danger, and in every affliction we have known; to whose eye every moment  of our lives has been exposed; he will not, he does not, forsake us now;  I feel his consolations in my heart. I shall leave you, my child, still  in his care; and, though I depart from this world, I shall be still in  his presence. Nay, weep not again, my Emily. In death there is nothing  new, or surprising, since we all know, that we are born to die; and  nothing terrible to those, who can confide in an all-powerful God.  Had my life been spared now, after a very few years, in the course  of nature, I must have resigned it; old age, with all its train of  infirmity, its privations and its sorrows, would have been mine; and  then, at last, death would have come, and called forth the tears you now  shed. Rather, my child, rejoice, that I am saved from such suffering,  and that I am permitted to die with a mind unimpaired, and sensible of  the comforts of faith and resignation.' St. Aubert paused, fatigued with  speaking. Emily again endeavoured to assume an air of composure; and, in  replying to what he had said, tried to sooth him with a belief, that he  had not spoken in vain.    When he had reposed a while, he resumed the conversation. 'Let me  return,' said he, 'to a subject, which is very near my heart. I said I  had a solemn promise to receive from you; let me receive it now, before  I explain the chief circumstance which it concerns; there are others,  of which your peace requires that you should rest in ignorance. Promise,  then, that you will perform exactly what I shall enjoin.'    Emily, awed by the earnest solemnity of his manner, dried her tears,  that had begun again to flow, in spite of her efforts to suppress them;  and, looking eloquently at St. Aubert, bound herself to do whatever he  should require by a vow, at which she shuddered, yet knew not why.    He proceeded: 'I know you too well, my Emily, to believe, that you would  break any promise, much less one thus solemnly given; your assurance  gives me peace, and the observance of it is of the utmost importance to  your tranquillity. Hear, then, what I am going to tell you. The closet,  which adjoins my chamber at La Vallee, has a sliding board in the floor.  You will know it by a remarkable knot in the wood, and by its being the  next board, except one, to the wainscot, which fronts the door. At the  distance of about a yard from that end, nearer the window, you will  perceive a line across it, as if the plank had been joined;--the way to  open it is this:--Press your foot upon the line; the end of the board  will then sink, and you may slide it with ease beneath the other. Below,  you will see a hollow place.' St. Aubert paused for breath, and Emily  sat fixed in deep attention. 'Do you understand these directions, my  dear?' said he. Emily, though scarcely able to speak, assured him that  she did.    'When you return home, then,' he added with a deep sigh--    At the mention of her return home, all the melancholy circumstances,  that must attend this return, rushed upon her fancy; she burst into  convulsive grief, and St. Aubert himself, affected beyond the resistance  of the fortitude which he had, at first, summoned, wept with her.  After some moments, he composed himself. 'My dear child,' said he, 'be  comforted. When I am gone, you will not be forsaken--I leave you only in  the more immediate care of that Providence, which has never yet forsaken  me. Do not afflict me with this excess of grief; rather teach me by  your example to bear my own.' He stopped again, and Emily, the more she  endeavoured to restrain her emotion, found it the less possible to do  so.    St. Aubert, who now spoke with pain, resumed the subject. 'That closet,  my dear,--when you return home, go to it; and, beneath the board I have  described, you will find a packet of written papers. Attend to me now,  for the promise you have given particularly relates to what I shall  direct. These papers you must burn--and, solemnly I command you, WITHOUT  EXAMINING THEM.'    Emily's surprise, for a moment, overcame her grief, and she ventured to  ask, why this must be? St. Aubert replied, that, if it had been right  for him to explain his reasons, her late promise would have been  unnecessarily exacted. 'It is sufficient for you, my love, to have a  deep sense of the importance of observing me in this instance.' St.  Aubert proceeded. 'Under that board you will also find about two hundred  louis d'ors, wrapped in a silk purse; indeed, it was to secure whatever  money might be in the chateau, that this secret place was contrived,  at a time when the province was over-run by troops of men, who took  advantage of the tumults, and became plunderers.    'But I have yet another promise to receive from you, which is--that  you will never, whatever may be your future circumstances, SELL the  chateau.' St. Aubert even enjoined her, whenever she might marry, to  make it an article in the contract, that the chateau should always  be hers. He then gave her a more minute account of his present  circumstances than he had yet done, adding, 'The two hundred louis, with  what money you will now find in my purse, is all the ready money I have  to leave you. I have told you how I am circumstanced with M. Motteville,  at Paris. Ah, my child! I leave you poor--but not destitute,' he added,  after a long pause. Emily could make no reply to any thing he now said,  but knelt at the bed-side, with her face upon the quilt, weeping over  the hand she held there.    After this conversation, the mind of St. Aubert appeared to be much more  at ease; but, exhausted by the effort of speaking, he sunk into a kind  of doze, and Emily continued to watch and weep beside him, till a gentle  tap at the chamber-door"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32706"],[0,"Triplanetary (#20)"],[1,"and had snapped the  lever to \"emergency.\"    \"Control room!\" he gasped then, and every speaker throughout the great  cruiser of the void blared out the warning as he forced his already  evacuated lungs to absolute emptiness. \"Vee-Two Gas! Get tight!\"    Writhing and twisting in his fierce struggle to keep his lungs from  gulping in a draft of that noxious atmosphere, and with the unconscious  form of the girl draped limply over his left arm, Costigan leaped toward  the portal of the nearest lifeboat. Orchestra instruments crashed to the  floor and dancing couples fell and sprawled inertly while the tortured  First Officer swung the door of the lifeboat open and dashed across the  tiny room to the air-valves. Throwing them wide open, he put his mouth  to the orifice and let his laboring lungs gasp their eager fill of the  cold blast roaring from the tanks. Then, air-hunger partially assuaged,  he again held his breath, broke open the emergency locker, donned one of  the space-suits always kept there, and opened its valves wide in order  to flush out of his uniform any lingering trace of the lethal gas.    He then leaped back to his companion. Shutting off the air, he released  a stream of pure oxygen, held her face in it, and made shift to force  some of it into her lungs by compressing and releasing her chest against  his own body. Soon she drew a spasmodic breath, choking and coughing,  and he again changed the gaseous stream to one of pure air, speaking  urgently as she showed signs of returning consciousness.    \"Stand up!\" he snapped. \"Hang onto this brace and keep your face in this  air-stream until I get a suit around you! Got me?\"    She nodded weakly, and, assured that she could hold herself at the  valve, it was the work of only a minute to encase her in one of the  protective coverings. Then, as she sat upon a bench, recovering her  strength, he flipped on the lifeboat's visiphone projector and shot its  invisible beam up into the control room, where he saw space-armored  figures furiously busy at the panels.    \"Dirty work at the cross-roads!\" he blazed to his captain, man to  man--formality disregarded, as it so often was in the Triplanetary  service. \"There's skulduggery afoot somewhere in our primary air! Maybe  that's the way they got those other two ships--pirates! Might have been  a timed bomb--don't see how anybody could have stowed away down there  through the inspections, and nobody but Franklin can neutralize the  shield of the air room--but I'm going to look around, anyway. Then I'll  join you fellows up there.\"    \"What was it?\" the shaken girl asked. \"I think that I remember your  saying 'Vee-Two gas.' That's forbidden! Anyway, I owe you my life,  Conway, and I'll never forget it--never. Thanks--but the others--how  about all the rest of us?\"    \"It was Vee-Two, and it is forbidden,\" Costigan replied grimly, eyes  fast upon the flashing plate, whose point of projection was now deep in  the bowels of the vessel. \"The penalty for using it or having it is  death on sight. Gangsters and pirates use it, since they have nothing to  lose, being on the death list already. As for your life, I haven't saved  it yet--you may wish I'd let it ride before we get done. The others are  too far gone for oxygen--couldn't have brought even you around in a few  more seconds, quick as I got to you. But there's a sure antidote--we all  carry it in a lock-box in our armor--and we all know how to use it,  because crooks all use Vee-Two and so we're always expecting it. But  since the air will be pure again in half an hour we'll be able to revive  the others easily enough if we can get by with whatever is going to  happen next. There's the bird that did it, right in the air-room. It's  the Chief Engineer's suit, but that isn't Franklin that's in it. Some  passenger--disguised--slugged the Chief--took his suit and  projectors--hole in duct--p-s-s-t! All washed out! Maybe that's all he  was scheduled to do to us in this performance, but he'll do nothing else  in his life!\"    \"Don't go down there!\" protested the girl. \"His armor is so much better  than that emergency suit you are wearing, and he's got Mr. Franklin's  Lewiston, besides!\"    \"Don't be an idiot!\" he snapped. \"We can't have a live pirate  aboard--we're going to be altogether too busy with outsiders directly.  Don't worry, I'm not going to give him a break. I'll take a  Standish--I'll rub him out like a blot. Stay right here until I come  back after you,\" he commanded, and the heavy door of the lifeboat  clanged shut behind him as he leaped out into the promenade.    Straight across the saloon he made his way, paying no attention to the  inert forms scattered here and there. Going up to a blank wall, he  manipulated an almost invisible dial set flush with its surface, swung a  heavy door aside, and lifted out the Standish--a fearsome weapon. Squat,  huge, and heavy, it resembled somewhat an overgrown machine rifle, but  one possessing a thick, short telescope, with several opaque condensing  lenses and parabolic reflectors. Laboring under the weight of the thing,  he strode along corridors and clambered heavily down short stairways.  Finally he came to the purifier room, and grinned savagely as he saw the  greenish haze of light obscuring the door and walls--the shield was  still in place; the pirate was still inside, still flooding with the  terrible Vee Two the _Hyperion's_ primary air.    He set his peculiar weapon down, unfolded its three massive legs,  crouched down behind it, and threw in a switch. Dull red beams of  frightful intensity shot from the reflectors and sparks, almost of  lightning proportions, leaped from the shielding screen under their  impact. Roaring and snapping, the conflict went on for seconds, then,  under the superior force of the Standish, the greenish radiance gave  way. Behind it the metal of the door ran the gamut of color--red,  yellow, blinding white--then literally exploded; molten, vaporized,  burned away. Through the aperture thus made Costigan could plainly see  the pirate in the space-armor of the chief engineer--an armor which was  proof against rifle fire and which could reflect and neutralize for some  little time even the terrific beam Costigan was employing. Nor was the  pirate unarmed--a vicious flare of incandescence leaped from his  Lewiston, to spend its force in spitting, crackling pyrotechnics against  the ether-wall of the squat and monstrous Standish. But Costigan's  infernal engine did not rely only upon vibratory destruction. At almost  the first flash of the pirate's weapon the officer touched a trigger,  there was a double report, ear-shattering in that narrowly confined  space, and the pirate's body literally flew into mist as a half-kilogram  shell tore through his armor and exploded. Costigan shut off his beam,  and with not the slightest softening of one hard lineament stared around  the air-room; making sure that no serious damage had been done to the  vital machinery of the air-purifier--the very lungs of the great  space-ship.    Dismounting the Standish, he lugged it back up to the main saloon,  replaced it in its safe, and again set the combination lock. Thence to  the lifeboat, where Clio cried out in relief as she saw that he was  unhurt.    \"Oh, Conway, I've been so afraid something would happen to you!\" she  exclaimed, as he led her rapidly upward toward the control room. \"Of  course you ...\" she paused.    \"Sure,\" he replied, laconically. \"Nothing to it. How do you feel--about  back to normal?\"    \"All right, I think, except for being scared to death and just about out  of control. I don't suppose that I'll be good for anything, but whatever  I can do, count me in on.\"    \"Fine--you may be needed, at that. Everybody's out, apparently, except  those like me, who had a warning and could hold their breath until they  got to their suits.\"    \"But how did you know what it was? You can't see it, nor smell it, nor  anything.\"    \"You inhaled a second before I did, and I saw your eyes. I've been in it  before--and when you see a man get a jolt of that stuff just once, you  never forget it. The engineers down below got it first, of course--it  must have wiped them out. Then we got it in the saloon. Your passing out  warned me, and luckily I had enough breath left to give the word. Quite  a few of the fellows up above should have had time to get away--we'll  see 'em all in the control room.\"    \"I suppose that was why you revived me--in payment for so kindly  warning you of the gas attack?\" The girl laughed; shaky, but game.    \"Something like that, probably,\" he answered, lightly. \"Here we are--now  we'll soon find out what's going to happen next.\"    In the control room they saw at least a dozen armored figures; not now  rushing about, but seated at their instruments, tense and ready.  Fortunate it was that Costigan--veteran of space as he was, though young  in years--had been down in the saloon; fortunate that he had been  familiar with that horrible outlawed gas; fortunate that he had had  presence of mind enough and sheer physical stamina enough to send his  warning without allowing one paralyzing trace to enter his own lungs.  Captain Bradley, the men on watch, and several other officers in their  quarters or in the wardrooms--space-hardened veterans all--had obeyed  instantly and without question the amplifiers' gasped command to \"get  tight\". Exhaling or inhaling, their air-passages had snapped shut as  that dread \"Vee-Two\" was heard, and they had literally jumped into their  armored suits of space--flushing them out with volume after volume of  unquestionable air; holding their breath to the last possible second,  until their straining lungs could endure no more.    Costigan waved the girl to a vacant bench, cautiously changing into his  own armor from the emergency suit he had been wearing, and approached  the captain.    \"Anything in sight, sir?\" he asked, saluting. \"They"]]]
