In utilizing these  results as the basis of a philosophy, we sacrifice the most valuable  and remarkable characteristic of scientific method, namely, that,  although almost everything in science is found sooner or later to  require some correction, yet this correction is almost always such as  to leave untouched, or only slightly modified, the greater part of the  results which have been deduced from the premiss subsequently  discovered to be faulty. The prudent man of science acquires a certain  instinct as to the kind of uses which may be made of present  scientific beliefs without incurring the danger of complete and utter  refutation from the modifications likely to be introduced by  subsequent discoveries. Unfortunately the use of scientific  generalisations of a sweeping kind as the basis of philosophy is just  that kind of use which an instinct of scientific caution would avoid,  since, as a rule, it would only lead to true results if the  generalisation upon which it is based stood in _no_ need of  correction.    We may illustrate these general considerations by means of two  examples, namely, the conservation of energy and the principle of  evolution.    (1) Let us begin with the conservation of energy, or, as Herbert  Spencer used to call it, the persistence of force. He says:[21]      \"Before taking a first step in the rational interpretation of    Evolution, it is needful to recognise, not only the facts that    Matter is indestructible and Motion continuous, but also the fact    that Force persists. An attempt to assign the _causes_ of    Evolution would manifestly be absurd if that agency to which the    metamorphosis in general and in detail is due, could either come    into existence or cease to exist. The succession of phenomena    would in such case be altogether arbitrary, and deductive Science    impossible.\"    This paragraph illustrates the kind of way in which the philosopher is  tempted to give an air of absoluteness and necessity to empirical  generalisations, of which only the approximate truth in the regions  hitherto investigated can be guaranteed by the unaided methods of  science. It is very often said that the persistence of something or  other is a necessary presupposition of all scientific investigation,  and this presupposition is then thought to be exemplified in some  quantity which physics declares to be constant. There are here, as it  seems to me, three distinct errors. First, the detailed scientific  investigation of nature does not _presuppose_ any such general laws as  its results are found to verify. Apart from particular observations,  science need presuppose nothing except the general principles of  logic, and these principles are not laws of nature, for they are  merely hypothetical, and apply not only to the actual world but to  whatever is _possible_. The second error consists in the  identification of a constant quantity with a persistent entity. Energy  is a certain function of a physical system, but is not a thing or  substance persisting throughout the changes of the system. The same is  true of mass, in spite of the fact that mass has often been defined as  _quantity of matter_. The whole conception of quantity, involving, as  it does, numerical measurement based largely upon conventions, is far  more artificial, far more an embodiment of mathematical convenience,  than is commonly believed by those who philosophise on physics. Thus  even if (which I cannot for a moment admit) the persistence of some  entity were among the necessary postulates of science, it would be a  sheer error to infer from this the constancy of any physical quantity,  or the _a priori_ necessity of any such constancy which may be  empirically discovered. In the third place, it has become more and  more evident with the progress of physics that large generalisations,  such as the conservation of energy or mass, are far from certain and  are very likely only approximate. Mass, which used to be regarded as  the most indubitable of physical quantities, is now generally believed  to vary according to velocity, and to be, in fact, a vector quantity  which at a given moment is different in different directions. The  detailed conclusions deduced from the supposed constancy of mass for  such motions as used to be studied in physics will remain very nearly  exact, and therefore over the field of the older investigations very  little modification of the older results is required. But as soon as  such a principle as the conservation of mass or of energy is erected  into a universal _a priori_ law, the slightest failure in absolute  exactness is fatal, and the whole philosophic structure raised upon  this foundation is necessarily ruined. The prudent philosopher,  therefore, though he may with advantage study the methods of physics,  will be very chary of basing anything upon what happen at the moment  to be the most general results apparently obtained by those methods.    (2) The philosophy of evolution, which was to be our second example,  illustrates the same tendency to hasty generalisation, and also  another sort, namely, the undue preoccupation with ethical notions.  There are two kinds of evolutionist philosophy, of which both Hegel  and Spencer represent the older and less radical kind, while  Pragmatism and Bergson represent the more modern and revolutionary  variety. But both these sorts of evolutionism have in common the  emphasis on _progress_, that is, upon a continual change from the  worse to the better, or from the simpler to the more complex. It  would be unfair to attribute to Hegel any scientific motive or  foundation, but all the other evolutionists, including Hegel's modern  disciples, have derived their impetus very largely from the history of  biological development. To a philosophy which derives a law of  universal progress from this history there are two objections. First,  that this history itself is concerned with a very small selection of  facts confined to an infinitesimal fragment of space and time, and  even on scientific grounds probably not an average sample of events in  the world at large. For we know that decay as well as growth is a  normal occurrence in the world. An extra-terrestrial philosopher, who  had watched a single youth up to the age of twenty-one and had never  come across any other human being, might conclude that it is the  nature of human beings to grow continually taller and wiser in an  indefinite progress towards perfection; and this generalisation would  be just as well founded as the generalisation which evolutionists base  upon the previous history of this planet. Apart, however, from this  scientific objection to evolutionism, there is another, derived from  the undue admixture of ethical notions in the very idea of progress  from which evolutionism derives its charm. Organic life, we are told,  has developed gradually from the protozoon to the philosopher, and  this development, we are assured, is indubitably an advance.  Unfortunately it is the philosopher, not the protozoon, who gives us  this assurance, and we can have no security that the impartial  outsider would agree with the philosopher's self-complacent  assumption. This point has been illustrated by the philosopher Chuang  Tz[)u] in the following instructive anecdote:      \"The Grand Augur, in his ceremonial robes, approached the shambles    and thus addressed the pigs: 'How can you object to die? I shall    fatten you for three months. I shall discipline myself for ten    days and fast for three. I shall strew fine grass, and place you    bodily upon a carved sacrificial dish. Does not this satisfy you?'      Then, speaking from the pigs' point of view, he continued: 'It is    better, perhaps, after all, to live on bran and escape the    shambles....'      'But then,' added he, speaking from his own point of view, 'to    enjoy honour when alive one would readily die on a war-shield or    in the headsman's basket.'      So he rejected the pigs' point of view and adopted his own point    of view. In what sense, then, was he different from the pigs?\"    I much fear that the evolutionists too often resemble the Grand Augur  and the pigs.    The ethical element which has been prominent in many of the most  famous systems of philosophy is, in my opinion, one of the most  serious obstacles to the victory of scientific method in the  investigation of philosophical questions. Human ethical notions, as  Chuang Tz[)u] perceived, are essentially anthropocentric, and involve,  when used in metaphysics, an attempt, however veiled, to legislate for  the universe on the basis of the present desires of men. In this way  they interfere with that receptivity to fact which is the essence of  the scientific attitude towards the world. To regard ethical notions  as a key to the understanding of the world is essentially  pre-Copernican. It is to make man, with the hopes and ideals which he  happens to have at the present moment, the centre of the universe and  the interpreter of its supposed aims and purposes. Ethical metaphysics  is fundamentally an attempt, however disguised, to give legislative  force to our own wishes. This may, of course, be questioned, but I  think that it is confirmed by a consideration of the way in which  ethical notions arise. Ethics is essentially a product of the  gregarious instinct, that is to say, of the instinct to co-operate  with those who are to form our own group against those who belong to  other groups. Those who belong to our own group are good; those who  belong to hostile groups are wicked. The ends which are pursued by our  own group are desirable ends, the ends pursued by hostile groups are  nefarious. The subjectivity of this situation is not apparent to the  gregarious animal, which feels that the general principles of justice  are on the side of its own herd.

I saw you with the men, pretending to clean the gun,  while I was yonder watching the sunset and waiting for an answer to a  message I had sent in to your mother, sir, when, as you saw me come  round the corner, you fired.\"    \"I did not, sir; for I was not there.\"    \"Ay, that's true enough, sir,\" said Ben, bitterly; \"he warn't here.\"    \"I don't believe it,\" cried Master Pawson, angrily, and his voice  sounded like that of some angry woman.  \"It was a trick; and all this  nonsense shall be put a stop to.\"    \"You can believe it or not, sir,\" said Roy, growing calmer as the  secretary waxed more angry.    \"I shall speak to Lady Royland at once.\"    \"Do, sir.  She is waiting to see you; she was telling me so when the gun  went off.\"    \"Gun went off!  And what business has a gun to go off here in this  place?\" cried the secretary, as he stood, now feeling himself all over  and brushing the dust from off his velvet coat.    \"Only got the wind of the gun, sir,\" said the corporal, quietly.    \"I was not speaking to you, my good man,\" cried the secretary.    \"Bad plan to stand nigh the muzzle of a big gun when she's going to be  fired,\" growled Ben, in a sententious voice, and the secretary turned  upon him sharply.    \"And you, sir,\" he cried; \"how dare you let a boy play such antics?  Do  you know I heard the shot go by my face.\"    \"Nay, sir; that I'll say you didn't,\" growled Ben.    \"But I say I did, sir, with a fierce rush.\"    \"One of the tomtits' eggs, perhaps, sergeant,\" said Roy, dryly.  \"I know  I caught sight of one or two when the nest was rammed in.\"    The men all burst out laughing, and Master Pawson grew preternaturally  calm.    \"Was that meant as an insult, Master Roy?\" he said, turning towards him  and speaking slowly, with his eyes half shut and an unpleasant, sneering  smile upon his lips.    \"No, sir; as a joke,\" replied Roy, gravely.    \"I thank you; but keep your jokes for the servants; try them upon the  menials.  Recollect that I am a gentleman, placed in authority over you  by Sir Granby Royland as tutor and master, and, as I am in authority  over you, I am in authority over all here.  Have the goodness to  recollect that.\"    He turned upon his heel and walked away, with the back of his doublet  covered with scraps of hay from the tomtits' nest, and Roy's first  inclination was to run after him to begin brushing him down.    \"But he'll only think I want to insult him again,\" said the boy to  himself.  \"I wish I hadn't said anything about the tomtits' eggs,  though.\"    \"Shall I run after him, sir, and ask if I shall give him a brush down?\"  whispered Ben.    \"No; let him find it out.  One of the maids will tell him, I dare say.\"    \"But you should ha' stopped by us when the gun was fired, Master Roy,\"  protested Ben.  \"I see them three chaps wink at each other, as much as  to say, `He won't stand fire,' and it hurt me, sir, and seemed to be  undoing all I did afore.  I didn't think it of you.\"    \"I should like to kick you for thinking me such a coward,\" cried Roy,  fiercely, for his encounter with the secretary had set his temper on  edge.  \"How dare you!  You had no business to fire till I came back.  I  did not want my mother to hear the report without some warning.--Here,  corporal, give me that light.\"    The man stepped up with it, and Roy took it out of his hand.    \"Going to fire this one, sir?\" said Ben, eagerly.    \"Of course.  Stand aside!\"  And Roy applied the sparkling port-fire to  the bit of prepared oakum standing out of the touch-hole, with the  result that it, too, began to sparkle and fume.    \"There,\" he said; \"I hope Master Pawson won't come back and be  frightened by this one.\"    He had hardly uttered the words when the secretary reappeared.    \"Where are all the servants?\" he cried, angrily.  \"I want some one to  come and brush my clothes.\"    \"Stand aside!\" shouted Ben.  \"She'll run right back.\"    But the secretary did not understand what was meant, and turned  haughtily upon the speaker, totally unconscious of the fact that he was  exactly behind the breech of the piece, whose recoil might have produced  fatal results.    It was no time for uttering warnings, and Roy knew it.  He glanced once  at the tiny sparkling going on at the touch-hole of the gun, and sprang  right at the secretary, driving him backward and falling heavily with  him to the ground.    It was none too soon, for the gun went off with a tremendous roar,  leaping up from the paving and running back on its low wheels right over  the spot where the secretary had just stood.    \"Guns is guns, and always was,\" said Ben, very grimly; \"and them as has  to do with 'em wants to know all their little ways.  I have know'd a  man's arm took off by the recoil, and, if you don't take care, their  breeches is as dangerous to them as fires 'em as is their muzzles.\"    \"Hurt, sir?\" cried Roy, offering his hand after gaining his own feet,  ready to help the tutor to rise.    Master Pawson made no reply, neither did he take the extended hand, but  rose and walked away limping, going right down through the pleasaunce so  as to reach his own room without having to pass through the corridor.    \"Bit rusty, I s'pose, sir,\" said Ben, quietly.    \"I am afraid so, Ben,\" was the reply.  \"But I don't think there's much  doubt about the powder.\"    \"Doubt, sir; why, it's stronger than they makes now, or else it has got  riper and better for keeping.  We're all right there.\"    \"Yes, capital! but that report rings in my ears still.\"    \"Ay, sir, a brass gun can ring as well as roar; but you won't mind it  after a few times.\"    \"I don't feel to mind it now,\" said Roy, coolly.    \"Not you, sir,\" whispered the old fellow.  \"And I beg your pardon,  Master Roy, and you've done me, and yourself too, a lot of good.  It  would ha' been horrid for the men to think you was scared.  I never  thought of frightening my lady with the row.  Tell the lads to sponge  the guns out with a bit o' rag, and then we'll run 'em back to their  places again.\"    Roy gave the order, and then had the sentry changed at the gate, after  which there was another duty to have performed,--that of raising the  drawbridge.    \"No fear of any one forgetting and walking into the moat at night, is  there, Ben?\"    \"Well, no, sir; I think not,\" said the old soldier, seriously.  \"You  see, the bridge shuts up all the middle when it's raised, and that makes  it sure, while at those sides nobody could tumble in without trying to;  so I don't see no fear of that.  Shall we haul her up, sir?\"    \"Yes.\"  And giving the order, as soon as the guns were in place, he led  the way up into the furnace-chamber, where two men seized each chain,  and the ponderous structure slowly rose as the huge weights descended  the stone-work tubes in which they hung, the difficulty of hoisting the  bridge proving to be much lighter than at the former trial.    \"Come, sir, that's safe.  You won't set sentries to-night?\"    \"No, of course not,\" said Roy; \"that will be unnecessary till there is  news of some enemy being near.\"        CHAPTER THIRTEEN.    THE COMING OF RECRUITS.    The next morning the carpenter was there with the capstan bars soon  after the bridge was lowered; and upon these being tried, after the  capstans and pulleys had been well greased, the portcullis was lowered  and raised several times with the greatest facility, each time becoming  more easy to move, while old Ben's eyes glistened, and he worked as if  all these preparations for the defence of the place, with the possible  shedding of blood and loss of life, had suddenly added a delightful zest  to his existence.    But he was not alone in this, for Roy found a strange exhilaration in  his new position.  There was something so novel in everything, and try  how he would, it was hard to keep down a feeling of vanity, especially  when he came upon his mother busily preparing a scarf for him to wear.    \"For me?\" he said.  \"Oh, mother! it's too fine.\"    \"Not at all,\" she said, quietly.  \"Your men will like to see their  leader look striking.\"    \"Ah, well,\" he replied, \"I can't wear it while there is so much dirty  work to do.\"    \"That will be done by the men.  Roy, my boy, you must rise to your  position, and give orders more for things to be done.\"    \"That's what old Ben says, and I am trying; but it's hard work while  everything is so new, and--\"    \"And what?\"    \"It seems as if Master--Oh, no; it's too paltry to be talked about.\"    \"Tell me what it is, and I will be the judge.\"    \"Well, you know how poor Master Pawson was upset with the firing?\"    \"Yes; and he ought to be very grateful to you for saving his life.  Has  he not thanked you?\"    \"No; unless looking sneeringly at everything I do is thanking me.  That  makes it seem so hard to put on a showy thing like that.  He'll only  laugh at it.\"    \"Master Pawson is not behaving well,\" said Lady Royland, coldly.  \"He  actually had the impertinence to speak to me last night about the  preparations, and objected to the men being taken from their work.\"    \"Said it was absurd?\"    \"Yes; those were his words, Roy, and I was compelled to silence him.  He  told me he was sure that if Sir Granby knew how utterly unlikely it was  for any of the disaffected people to come into this neighbourhood he  would immediately cancel the orders, and, under the circumstances, he  could not refrain from advising me to act according to his advice.\"    \"And what was his advice, mother?\"    \"To put a stop to the foolish preparations, which could only bring  ridicule upon all here.\"    \"He said something of the kind to me; more than I told you.\"    \"Why did you not tell me all?\"    \"Because it seemed so paltry.\"    \"Nothing is too paltry when we have so much at stake, Roy.\"    \"And was that the end of it?\"    \"No,"]]]
