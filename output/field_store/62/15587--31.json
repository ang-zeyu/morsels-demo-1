I tried hard, with the aid of 150 burghers, to thwart  his plans and we had some fighting. But the locality was against us,  and the enemy with their great force of infantry and with the help of  their guns forced us to retire.    About the 11th of September I was ordered to fall back along the  railway, via Duivelskantoor and Nelspruit Station, since General  Buller was threatening Nelspruit in the direction of Spitskop, while  General French, with a great force, was nearing Barberton. It appeared  extremely likely that we should be surrounded very soon. We marched  through the Godwan River and over the colossal mountain near  Duivelskantoor, destroying the railway bridges behind us. The road we  followed was swamped by the heavy rains and nearly impassable. Carts  were continually being upset, breakdowns were frequent, and our guns  often stuck in the swampy ground. To make matters worse, a burgher on  horseback arrived about midnight to tell us that Buller's column had  taken Nelspruit Station, and cut off our means of retreat. Yet we had  to pass Nelspruit; there was no help for it. I gave instructions for  the waggons and carts (numbering over a hundred), to push on as  quickly as possible, and sent out a strong mounted advance guard to  escort them.    I myself went out scouting with some burghers, for I wanted to find  out before daybreak whether Nelspruit was really in the hands of the  enemy or not. In that case our carts and guns would have to be  destroyed or hidden, while the commando would have to escape along  the footpaths. We crept up to the station, and just at dawn, when we  were only a hundred paces away from it, a great fire burst out,  accompanied by occasional loud reports. This somewhat reassured me. I  soon found our own people to be in possession burning things, and the  detonations were obviously not caused by the bursting of shells fired  from field-pieces. On sending two of my adjutants--Rokzak and Koos  Nel--to the station to obtain further details, they soon came back to  report that there was nobody there except a nervous old Dutchman. The  burgher, who had told me Nelspruit was in the hands of the enemy, must  have dreamt it.    The conflagration I found was caused by a quantity of \"kastions\" and  ammunition-waggons which had been set afire on the previous day, while  the explosions emanated from the shells which had been left among  their contents.    The enemy's advance guard had pushed on to Shamoham and Sapthorpe,  about 12 miles from the railway, enabling the whole of my commando to  pass. We arrived at Nelspruit by eight o'clock. That day we rested and  discussed future operations, feeling that our prospects seemed to grow  worse every day.    The station presented a sad spectacle. Many trucks loaded with  victuals, engines, and burst gun-carriages--everything had been left  behind at the mercy of the first-comer, while a large number of  kaffirs were plundering and stealing. Only the day before the  Government had had its seat there, and how desolate and distressing  the sight was now! The traces of a fugitive Government were  unmistakable. Whatever might have been our optimism before, however  little inclination the burghers might have felt to surrender, however  great the firmness of the officers, and their resolve to keep the  beloved \"Vierkleur\" flying, scenes like those at Nooitgedacht, and  again at Nelspruit, were enough to make even the strongest and most  energetic lose all courage. Many men could not keep back their tears  at the disastrous spectacle, as they thought of the future of our  country and of those who had been true to her to the last.    Kaffirs, as I said, had been making sad havoc among the provisions,  clothes and ammunition, and I ordered them to be driven away. Amongst  the many railway-waggons I found some loaded with clothes the fighting  burghers had in vain and incessantly been asking for, also cannon and  cases of rifle ammunition. We also came across a great quantity of  things belonging to our famous medical commission, sweets, beverages,  etc. The suspicion which had existed for some considerable time  against this commission was, therefore, justified. There was even a  carriage which had been used by some of its members, beautifully  decorated, with every possible comfort and luxury, one compartment  being filled with bottles of champagne and valuable wines. My  officers, who were no saints, saw that our men were well provided for  out of these. The remainder of the good things was shifted on to a  siding, where about twenty engines were kept. By great good luck the  Government commissariat stock, consisting of some thousands of sheep,  and even some horses, had also been left behind. But we were not  cheered.    Among the many questions asked regarding this sad state of affairs was  one put by an old burger:    \"Dat is nou die plan, want zooals zaken hier lyk, dan heeft die boel  in wanhoop gevlug.\" (\"Is that the plan, then? For from what I can see  of it, they have all fled in despair.\")    I answered, \"Perhaps they were frightened away, Oom.\"    \"Ja,\" he said, \"but look, General, it seems to me as if our members of  the Government do not intend to continue the war. You can see this by  the way they have now left everything behind for the second time.\"    \"No, old Oom,\" I replied, \"we should not take any notice of this. Our  people are wrestling among the waves of a stormy ocean; the gale is  strong, and the little boat seems upon the point of capsizing, but, it  has not gone down as yet. Now and then the boat is dashed against the  rocks and the splinters fly, but the faithful sailors never lose  heart. If they were to do that the dinghy would soon go under, and the  crew would disappear for ever. It would be the last page of their  history, and their children would be strangers in their own country.  You understand, Oom?\"    \"Yes, General, but I shall not forget to settle up, for I myself and  others with me have had enough of this, and the War has opened our  eyes.\"    \"All right, old man.\" I rejoined, \"nobody can prevent you  surrendering, but I have now plenty of work to do; so get along.\"    [Illustration: My Talk with Erasmus (Non-Combatant).]    Burghers of different commandos who had strayed--some on  purpose--passed us here in groups of two or ten or more. Some of them  were going to their own districts, right through the English lines,  others were looking for their cattle, which they had allowed to stray  in order to evade the enemy. I could only tell them that the veldt  between Nelspruit and Barberton up to Avoca, was, so far as I had been  able to discover, full of cattle and waggons belonging to farmers  who now had no chance of escaping. Everybody wanted some information  from the General.    About half a score of burghers with bridle horses then came up. There  was one old burgher among them with a long beard, a great veldt hat,  and armed with a Mauser which seemed hardly to have been used. He  carried two belts with a good stock of cartridges, a revolver, and a  _tamaai_ (long sjambok). This veteran strode up in grand martial style  to where I was sitting having something to eat. As he approached he  looked brave enough to rout the whole British army.    \"Dag!\" (Good morning.) \"Are you the General?\" asked the old man.    \"Yes, I have the honour of being called so. Are you a field-marshal, a  Texas Jack, or what?\"    \"My name is Erasmus, from the Pretoria district,\" he replied, \"and my  nine comrades and myself, with my family and cattle, have gone into  the bush. I saw them all running away, the Government and all. You are  close to the Portuguese border, and my mates and I want to know what  your plans are.\"    \"Well,\" Mr. Erasmus, I returned, \"what you say is almost true; but as  you say you and your comrades have been hiding in the bush with your  cattle and your wives, I should like to know if you have ever tried to  oppose the enemy yet, and also what is your right to speak like this.\"    \"Well, I had to flee with my cattle, for you have to live on that as  well as I.\"    \"Right,\" said I; \"what do you want, for I do not feel inclined to talk  any longer.\"    \"I want to know,\" he replied, \"if you intend to retire, and if there  is any chance of making peace. If not, we will go straight away to  Buller, and 'hands-up,' then we shall save all our property.\"    \"Well, my friend,\" I remarked, \"our Government and the  Commandant-General are the people who have to conclude peace, and it  is not for you or me, when our family and cattle are in danger, to  surrender to the enemy, which means turning traitor to your own  people.\"    \"Well, yes; good-bye, General, we are moving on now.\"    I sent a message to our outposts to watch these fellows, and to see if  they really were going over to the enemy. And, as it happened, that  same night my Boers came to camp with the Mausers and horses Erasmus  and his party had abandoned. They had gone over to Buller.    The above is but an instance illustrating what often came under my  notice during the latter period of my command. This sort of burgher,  it turned out, invariably belonged to a class that never meant to  fight. In many cases we could do better without them, for it was  always these people who wanted to know exactly what was \"on the  cards,\" and whenever things turned out unpleasantly, they only misled  and discouraged others. Obviously, we were better off without them.          CHAPTER XXII.    AN IGNOMINIOUS DISPERSAL.      Commandant-General Botha, who was then invalided at Hector's Spruit  Station, now sent word that we were to join him there without delay.  He said I could send part of the commando by train, but the railway  arrangements were now all disturbed, and everything was in a muddle.  As nothing could be relied on in the way of transport, the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2520"],[0,"The Man (#20)"],[1,"hand as in a vice.  Then seeing no resource, he answered:    'I did not!  That does not mean that I won't, though!' he added  defiantly.  To his surprise Harold suddenly released his hand.  There was  a grimness in his tone as he said:    'That will do!  I know now that you have spoken the truth, sober as well  as drunk.  You need say no more.  I know the rest.  Most men--even brutes  like you, if there are any--would have been ashamed even to think the  things you said, said openly to me, you hound.  You vile, traitorous,  mean-souled hound!'    'What did I say?'    'I know what you said; and I shall not forget it.'  He went on, his voice  deepening into a stern judicial utterance, as though he were pronouncing  a sentence of death:    'Leonard Everard, you have treated vilely a lady whom I love and honour  more than I love my own soul.  You have insulted her to her face and  behind her back.  You have made such disloyal reference to her and to her  mad act in so trusting you, and have so shown your intention of causing,  intentionally or unintentionally, woe to her, that I tell you here and  now that you hold henceforth your life in your hand.  If you ever mention  to a living soul what you have told me twice to-night, even though you  should be then her husband; if you should cause her harm though she  should then be your wife; if you should cause her dishonour in public or  in private, I shall kill you.  So help me God!'    Not a word more did he say; but, taking up the reins, drove on in silence  till they arrived at the gate of Brindehow, where he signed to him to  alight.    He drove off in silence.    When he arrived at his own house he sent the servant to bed, and then  went to his study, where he locked himself in.  Then, and then only, did  he permit his thoughts to have full range.  For the first time since the  blow had fallen he looked straight in the face the change in his own  life.  He had loved Stephen so long and so honestly that it seemed to him  now as if that love had been the very foundation of his life.  He could  not remember a time when he had not loved her; away back to the time when  he, a big boy, took her, a little girl, under his care, and devoted  himself to her.  He had grown into the belief that so strong and so  consistent an affection, though he had never spoken it or even hinted at  it or inferred it, had become a part of her life as well as of his own.  And this was the end of that dreaming!  Not only did she not care for  him, but found herself with a heart so empty that she needs must propose  marriage to another man!  There was surely something, more than at  present he knew of or could understand, behind such an act done by her.  Why should she ask Everard to marry her?  Why should she ask any man?  Women didn't do such things! . . . Here he paused.  'Women didn't do such  things.'  All at once there came back to him fragments of discussions--in  which Stephen had had a part, in which matters of convention had been  dealt with.  Out of these dim and shattered memories came a comfort to  his heart, though his brain could not as yet grasp the reason of it.  He  knew that Stephen had held an unconventional idea as to the equality of  the sexes.  Was it possible that she was indeed testing one of her  theories?    The idea stirred him so that he could not remain quiet.  He stood up, and  walked the room.  Somehow he felt light beginning to dawn, though he  could not tell its source, or guess at the final measure of its fulness.  The fact of Stephen having done such a thing was hard to bear; but it was  harder to think that she should have done such a thing without a motive;  or worse: with love of Leonard as a motive!  He shuddered as he paused.  She could not love such a man.  It was monstrous!  And yet she had done  this thing . . . 'Oh, if she had had any one to advise her, to restrain  her!  But she had no mother!  No mother!  Poor Stephen!'    The pity of it, not for himself but for the woman he loved, overcame him.  Sitting down heavily before his desk, he put his face on his hands, and  his great shoulders shook.    Long, long after the violence of his emotion had passed, he sat there  motionless, thinking with all the power and sincerity he knew; thinking  for Stephen's good.    When a strong man thinks unselfishly some good may come out of it.  He  may blunder; but the conclusion of his reasoning must be in the main  right.  So it was with Harold.  He knew that he was ignorant of women,  and of woman's nature, as distinguished from man's.  The only woman he  had ever known well was Stephen; and she in her youth and in her  ignorance of the world and herself was hardly sufficient to supply to him  data for his present needs.  To a clean-minded man of his age a woman is  something divine.  It is only when in later life disappointment and  experience have hammered bitter truth into his brain, that he begins to  realise that woman is not angelic but human.  When he knows more, and  finds that she is like himself, human and limited but with qualities of  purity and sincerity and endurance which put his own to shame, he  realises how much better a helpmate she is for man than could be the  vague, unreal creations of his dreams.  And then he can thank God for His  goodness that when He might have given us Angels He did give us women!    Of one thing, despite the seeming of facts, he was sure: Stephen did not  love Leonard.  Every fibre of his being revolted at the thought.  She of  so high a nature; he of so low.  She so noble; he so mean.  Bah! the  belief was impossible.    Impossible!  Herein was the manifestation of his ignorance; anything is  possible where love is concerned!  It was characteristic of the man that  in his mind he had abandoned, for the present at all events, his own  pain.  He still loved Stephen with all the strength of his nature, but  for him the selfish side ceased to exist.  He was trying to serve  Stephen; and every other thought had to give way.  He had been satisfied  that in a manner she loved him in some way and in some degree; and he had  hoped that in the fulness of time the childish love would ripen, so that  in the end would come a mutual affection which was of the very essence of  Heaven.  He believed still that she loved him in some way; but the future  that was based on hope had now been wiped out with a sudden and unsparing  hand.  She had actually proposed marriage to another man.  If the idea of  a marriage with him had ever crossed her mind she could have had no doubt  of her feeling toward another. . . . And yet?  And yet he could not  believe that she loved Leonard; not even if all trains of reasoning  should end by leading to that point.  One thing he had at present to  accept, that whatever might be the measure of affection Stephen might  have for him, it was not love as he understood it.  He resolutely turned  his back on the thought of his own side of the matter, and tried to find  some justification of Stephen's act.    'Seek and ye shall find; knock and it shall be opened to ye' has perhaps  a general as well as a special significance.  It is by patient tireless  seeking that many a precious thing has been found.  It was after many a  long cycle of thought that the seeking and the knocking had effectual  result.  Harold came to believe, vaguely at first but more definitely as  the evidence nucleated, that Stephen's act was due to some mad girlish  wish to test her own theory; to prove to herself the correctness of her  own reasoning, the fixity of her own purpose.  He did not go on analysing  further; for as he walked the room with a portion of the weight taken  from his heart he noticed that the sky was beginning to quicken.  The day  would soon be upon him, and there was work to be done.  Instinctively he  knew that there was trouble in store for Stephen, and he felt that in  such an hour he should be near her.  All her life she had been accustomed  to him.  In her sorrows to confide in him, to tell him her troubles so  that they might dwindle and pass away; to enhance her pleasures by making  him a sharer in them.    Harold was inspirited by the coming of the new day.  There was work to be  done, and the work must be based on thought.  His thoughts must take a  practical turn; what was he to do that would help Stephen?  Here there  dawned on him for the first time the understanding of a certain  humiliation which she had suffered; she had been refused!  She who had  stepped so far out of the path of maidenly reserve in which she had  always walked as to propose marriage to a man, had been refused!  He did  not, could not, know to the full the measure of such humiliation to a  woman; but he could guess at any rate a part.  And that guessing made him  grind his teeth in impotent rage.    But out of that rage came an inspiration.  If Stephen had been humiliated  by the refusal of one man, might not this be minimised if she in turn  might refuse another?  Harold knew so well the sincerity of his own love  and the depth of his own devotion that he was satisfied that he could not  err in giving the girl the opportunity of refusing him.  It would be some  sort of balm to her wounded spirit to know that Leonard's views were not  shared by all men.  That there were others who would deem it a joy to  serve as her slaves.  When she had refused him she would perhaps feel  easier in her mind.  Of course if she did not refuse him . . . Ah! well,  then would the gates of Heaven open . . . But that would never be.  The  past could not be blotted out!  All he could do would be to serve her.  He  would go early.  Such a man as Leonard Everard might make some new  complication, and the present was quite bad enough.    It was a poor enough thing for him, he thought at length.  She might  trample on him; but it was for her sake.  And to him what did it matter?  The worst had come.  All was over now!          CHAPTER XIV--THE"]]]
