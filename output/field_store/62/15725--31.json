THE DACHSHUND.    We are indebted to Mr. William Loeffler for the following  comprehensive, entertaining special article on the little understood  Dachshund:    Of the many breeds of dogs in existence, none have gained more  friends and won more hearts and a stronger hold in American home in a  comparative short time than the Dachshund.    Those who have not seen a single specimen and are entirely ignorant  regarding his characteristics, know him by continued caricature.    For centuries back he was the most favored pet of German aristocracy,  carefully guarded and upheld in his purity, and it was only  occasionally that an outsider received a specimen. A gift of a  Dachshund was considered a token of high esteem.      [Illustration: True Dachshund Specimens.]    Though he has not lost a particle of his prestige in this respect,  and has strong admirers in the royal families of Europe, he is  rapidly becoming a cosmopolitan; with his little crooked legs he now  travels over many lands, making friends wherever he lands.    At all times Dachshunde were in charge of professional hunters, who  developed their instinct for hunting wonderfully, and the courage,  endurance and strength exhibited in pursuing their game is  astonishing and marvelous.    The long body, short and muscular legs, the entire strength being  centered in his deep chest, indicate that he is intended for work  under ground.    To attack a badger or a fox in his own burrow requires bravery of a  high degree, especially as the dog is in most cases much smaller than  his game. He relies upon the strength of his jaws and his wonderfully  developed set of teeth for his work and does not snap or bite at  random, but his attack is usually well aimed and effective.    The game-keeper's duty is to destroy all enemies of the game  entrusted to his care, consequently foxes, badgers, minks and other  vermin are at all times subject to extermination, and the Dachshund  is his untiring and able assistant in this work.    His scenting power is of the keenest and he will locate his prey very  quickly when he strikes a trail. A fox generally leaves his burrow  when the dog enters his domain and falls a victim to the gunner's  aim; not so with the badger, who crawl into a corner of his burrow,  and two dogs in most cases attack him from different entries, and  finally crowd him so that he will stay at bay. The location of the  badger can easily be given by the barking of the dogs, and the hunter  digs down with pick and spade, when the ground permits such work,  until the badger can be seen. By means of a fork pushed over his neck  the badger is held and captured.    The Dachshund is also invaluable for finding wounded deer; for which  purpose the hunter usually chains the dog, who then leads his master  over the trail to locate the game.    At home the Dachshund's disposition changes entirely; he is now a  most affectionate and docile animal, and shows by his every  expression his attachment for his master and his family. His  intelligence is surprising; as a watch or house dog he has few  equals, the slightest disturbance will not escape his keen senses and  the alarm is given. Most always one member of the family he selects  as his special idol, in many cases a child, and it is amusing to  watch him, how he does everything in his power to show his affection,  following every step taken by his beloved friend. He will frolic for  hours and never seem to tire or lose his good temper, and he is  always on hand when wanted. He knows the friends of the family and  never molests them, but he will not tolerate tramps.    The color of the Dachshund is of great variety, the original stock  being black and tan, from which later developed chocolate and tan,  gray and tan and single color red, ranging from fawn to dark mahogany  red. The spotted Dachshund, such as black and tan as a ground color  showing silver gray patches of irregular sizes throughout the black  field is of comparatively recent development. Most all have short and  glossy coats.    The unusual shape of this dog, combined with a beautiful color, the  graceful and dignified walk, the aristocratic bearing, will draw the  attention and admiration of every one who sees him.    THE BASSET HOUND.    The American beagle has a brother in France, called the Basset. He is  slow, acute scenter and in general has characteristics in common with  the beagle.    Those few dogs in this country erroneously called Basset hounds,  (aside from a very few imported for bench show purposes) are  doubtless resulted from beagle and mongrel crossed.      [Illustration: A Pure Pointer.]        CHAPTER XXII.    POINTERS AND SETTERS.--SPANIELS.    It is not within our province to dwell at length upon the subject of  \"bird\" dogs. We will content ourselves with briefly pointing out some  more salient points of appearance and character. Those who wish to  make a study and follow extensively wing shooting, and raise and  train suitable dogs for the purpose, may obtain books relating  exclusively to that subject.    While adapted to the same purposes in the field, there are  differences in the appearance and methods of pointers and setters  that give rise to two distinct classes.    In the field, if we may take for granted the claims of men long  schooled in wing shooting, we may say in a general way, that the  pointer excels in woods--heavy cover, and brushy sections. In such  places a slower dog is required as well as one that willingly hunts  close to the shooter.    For work in open fields or over prairie land, the setter is perhaps  better suited, because he, as a rule, \"has greater speed, wider  range, greater endurance and staying qualities. If retrieving from  water came into play, the setter also would have the preference. As  to which of the two breeds has the best nose, and which is the better  bird finder, nothing can be said with a degree of certainty--they are  equal, but there is a vast difference in individuals. The same is  true as to retaining inculcated training.\"      [Illustration: Royal Sports.--Pointers in Action.]    The pointer is the older breed, being a product of the middle ages.  He bobs up, ever and anon, in the history of hunting down to the  present. There has been now and again some inclination to cross the  pointer and fox hounds, among huntsmen, some claiming even in this  day that it improves either type of dog for his given duties.  Purists, however, insist on keeping them pure and undefiled.    In appearance the pointer is larger than the setter, and gives one an  impression of solidity and strength; his coat should be soft and  mellow, but not absolutely silky. The hair is short and straight.    The setter's coat should be long, straight and silky (a slight wave  is admissible) which should be the case with the breeches and fore  legs, which, nearly down to the feet, should be well feathered. The  color may be either white and black, white and orange, white and  lemon, white and liver, or black, white and tan; those without heavy  patches on the body, but flecked all over, called Belton, preferred.    There is, as in most other questions of hunting and shooting  experiences, wide difference of opinion as to the relative values of  the two breeds for practical field work and bench purposes.    The casual field shooter will not go wrong in selecting either kind,  so long as he secures a creditable and really representative  individual.      [Illustration: Setter.]    A distinct setter strain is the black and tan Gordon. Writes an  authority: \"The Gordon is a much heavier dog in all his parts than  the English setter; coarser in skull, thicker in shoulders and  usually carrying lots of useless lumber. As a consequence he lacks  the speed of his English brethren, and for this reason he is not a  desirable field trial candidate, but as a steady, reliable dog, with  more than average bird finding ability, he will always have a number  of admirers.\"    The Irish setter is another interesting one of the setter family. He  is not as popular in America as the others, though a handsome and  capable performer. His color is red, with white on chest, throat or  toes, or a small star on the forehead.    The manner of judging pedigreed field dogs has been reduced to an  almost exact science. After all, however, all this is not for the  casual hunter and many an embryo sportsman tramps the fields after  capable, though not so high-toned dogs, and enjoys it all more than  the nervous owner watching his dog in the field trial.    SPANIELS.    Spaniels are not utilized to any extent as hunting dogs in this  country, although they are sometimes crossed to good advantage with  other hunting dogs. About the water, the water spaniel is well  adapted. For instance some spaniel blood in a mink dog is well worth  considering.    All of the spaniels, readily develop into retrievers, and this is  their principal use at present, although they can be taught to hunt  with considerable effect and judgment, where too much is not expected  of them. They are lively, happy little workers, and on grouse in  dense coverts, no dog possesses a better nose for the purpose. Their  size, too, is against them for most practical purposes.        CHAPTER XXIII.    TERRIERS--AIREDALES.    Practical hunters have no interest in the numerous Terrier family,  save perhaps two types.    We find those who urge the use of the terrier for some purposes. For  instance, a Canadian brother has the following to say as to the Fox  Terrier:    I like the hound, but give me a well trained fox terrier as his  companion, and I will get most every fox. They have no trouble to  hole in less than six hours, there is where the terrier shines and  puts in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3434"],[0,"The Koran (Al-Qur'an) (#20)"],[1," This truly is a warning: And whoso willeth, taketh the way to his Lord;    But will it ye shall not, unless God will it, for God is Knowing, Wise.

See! on a blessed night2 have we sent it down, for we would warn mankind:    On the night wherein all things are disposed in wisdom,3    By virtue of our behest. Lo! we have ever sent forth Apostles,    A mercy from thy Lord: he truly heareth and knoweth all things    Lord of the Heavens and of the Earth and of all that is between them,if ye  be firm in faith    There is no God but He!He maketh alive and killeth!Your Lord and the Lord  of your sires of old!    Yet with doubts do they disport them.    But mark them on the day when the Heaven shall give out a palpable SMOKE,    Which shall enshroud mankind: this will be an afflictive torment.    They will cry, \"Our Lord! relieve us from this torment: see! we are  believers.\"    But how did warning avail them, when an undoubted apostle had come to them;    And they turned their backs on him, and said, \"Taught by others, possessed?\"    Were we to relieve you from the plague even a little, ye would certainly  relapse.4    On the day when we shall fiercely put forth our great fierceness, we will  surely take vengeance on them!    Of old, before their time, had we proved the people of Pharaoh, when a noble  apostle presented himself to them.    \"Send away with me,\" cried he, \"the servants of God; for I am an apostle  worthy of all credit:    And exalt not yourselves against God, for I come to you with undoubted power;    And I take refuge with Him who is my Lord and your Lord, that ye stone me  not:    And if ye believe me not, at least separate yourselves from me.\"    And he cried to his Lord, \"That these are a wicked people.\"    \"March forth then, said God, with my servants by night, for ye will be  pursued.    And leave behind you the cleft sea: they are a drowned host.\"    How many a garden and fountain did they quit!    And corn fields and noble dwellings!    And pleasures in which they rejoiced them!    So was it: and we gave them as a heritage to another people.    Nor Heaven nor Earth wept for them, nor was their sentence respited;    And we rescued the children of Israel from a degrading affliction    From Pharaoh, for he was haughty, given to excess.    And we chose them, in our prescience, above all peoples,5    And we shewed them miracles wherein was their clear trial.    Yet these infidels say,    \"There is but our first death, neither shall we be raised again:    Bring back our sires, if ye be men of truth.\"    Are they better than the people of Tobba,6    And those who flourished before them whom we destroyed for their evil deeds?    We have not created the Heavens and the Earth and whatever is between them in  sport:    We have not created them but for a serious end:7 but the greater part of them  understand it not.    Verily the day of severing8 shall be the appointed time of all:    A day when the master shall not at all be aided by the servant, neither shall  they be helped;    Save those on whom God shall have mercy: for He is the mighty, the merciful.    Verily the tree of Ez-Zakkoum9    Shall be the sinner's10 food:    Like dregs of oil shall it boil up in their bellies,    Like the boiling of scalding water.    \"Seize ye him, and drag him into the mid-fire;    Then pour on his head of the tormenting boiling water.    'Taste this:' for thou forsooth art the mighty, the honourable!    Lo! this is that of which ye doubted.\"    But the pious shall be in a secure place,    Amid gardens and fountains,    Clothed in silk and richest robes, facing one another:    Thus shall it be: and we will wed them to the virgins with large dark eyes:    Therein shall they call, secure, for every kind of fruit;    Therein, their first death passed, shall they taste death no more; and He  shall keep them from the pains of Hell:    'Tis the gracious bounty of thy Lord! This is the great felicity.    We have made this Koran easy for thee in thine own tongue, that they may take  the warning.    Therefore wait thou, for they are waiting.11    _______________________    1 See Sura lxviii.

SURA L.KAF [LIV.]    MECCA.45 Verses    In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful.    Kaf1. By the glorious Koran:    They marvel forsooth that one of themselves hath come to them charged with  warnings. \"This,\" say the infidels, \"is a marvellous thing:    What! when dead and turned to dust shall we. . . .? Far off is such a return  as this?\"    Now know we what the earth consumeth of them, and with us is a Book in which  account is kept.    But they have treated the truth which hath come to them as falsehood;  perplexed therefore is their state.    Will they not look up to the heaven above them, and consider how we have  reared it and decked it forth, and that there are no flaws therein?    And as to the earth, we have spread it out, and have thrown the mountains  upon it, and have caused an upgrowth in it of all beauteous kinds of plants,    For insight and admonition to every servant who loveth to turn to God:    And we send down the rain from Heaven with its blessings, by which we cause  gardens to spring forth and the grain of harvest,    And the tall palm trees with date-bearing branches one above the other    For man's nourishment: And life give we thereby to a dead country. So also  shall be the resurrection.    Ere the days of these (Meccans) the people of Noah, and the men of Rass2 and  Themoud, treated their prophets as impostors:    And Ad and Pharaoh, and the brethren of Lot and the dwellers in the forest,  and the people of Tobba,3 all gave the lie to their prophets: justly,  therefore, were the menaces inflicted.    Are we wearied out with the first creation? Yet are they in doubt with regard  to a new creation!4    We created man: and we know what his soul whispereth to him, and we are  closer to him than his neck-vein.    When the two angels charged with taking account shall take it, one sitting on  the right hand, the other on the left:    Not a word doth he utter, but there is a watcher with him ready to note it  down:    And the stupor of certain death cometh upon him: \"This is what thou wouldst  have shunned\"    And there shall be a blast on the trumpet,it is the threatened day!    And every soul shall come,an angel with it urging it along, and an angel to  witness against it5    Saith he, \"Of this day didst thou live in heedlessness: but we have taken off  thy veil from thee, and thy sight is becoming sharp this day.\"    And he who is at this side6 shall say, \"This is what I am prepared with  against thee.\"    And God will say, \"Cast into Hell, ye twain, every infidel, every hardened  one,    The hinderer of the good, the transgressor, the doubter,    Who set up other gods with God. Cast ye him into the fierce torment.\"    He who is at his side shall say, \"O our Lord! I led him not astray, yet was  he in an error wide of truth.\"    He shall say, \"Wrangle not in my presence. I had plied you beforehand with  menaces:    My doom changeth not, and I am not unjust to man.\"    On that day will we cry to Hell, \"Art thou full?\" And it shall say, \"Are  there more?\"7    And not far from thence shall Paradise be brought near unto the Pious:     \"This is what ye have been promised: to every one who hath turned in  penitence to God and kept his laws;    Who hath feared the God of Mercy in secret, and come to him with a contrite  heart:    Enter it in peace: this is the day of Eternity.\"    There shall they have all that they can desire: and our's will it be to  augment their bliss:    And how many generations have we destroyed ere the days of these (Meccans),  mightier than they in strength! Search ye then the land. Is there any escape?    Lo! herein is warning for him who hath a heart, or giveth ear, and is himself  an eye-witness.8    We created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six  days, and no weariness touched us.9    Wherefore put up with what they say, and celebrate the praise of thy Lord  before sunrise and before sunset:    And praise Him in the night: and perform the two final prostrations.    And list for the day whereon the crier shall cry from a place near to every  one alike:    The day on which men shall in truth hear that shout will be the day of their  coming forth from the grave.    Verily, we cause to live, and we cause to die. To us shall all return.    On the day when the earth shall swiftly cleave asunder over the dead, will  this gathering be easy to Us.    We know best what the infidels say: and thou art not to compel them.    Warn"]]]
