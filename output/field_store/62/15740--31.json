He was at once authoritative       and humane, severe, yet indefatigably kind; modest, but       aspiring and secretly conscious of ability. The brave       soldier dutifully loved and obeyed his widowed mother, and       his gentle nature saw visions of happiness in scenes of       domestic love, even while he kindled at the prospect of       glory, as 'gunpowder at fire.'\"    On the 28th of May the expedition reached Halifax.--         \"For six days after the British forces on their way from       Halifax to Louisburgh, had entered Chapeau Rouge Bay, the       surf, under a high wind, made the rugged shore inaccessible,       and gave the French time to strengthen and extend their       lines. The sun still dashed heavily, when, before daybreak,       on the 8th of June, the troops, under cover of a random fire       from the frigates, attempted disembarking. Wolfe, the third       brigadier, who led the first division, would not allow a gun       to be fired, cheered on the rowers, and, on coming to shoal       water, jumped into the sea; and, in spite of the surf, which       broke several boats and upset more, in spite of the       well-directed fire of the French, in spite of their       breastwork and rampart of felled trees, whose interwoven       branches made one continued wall of green, the English       landed, took the batteries, drove in the French, and on the       same day invested Louisburgh. At that landing, none was more       gallant than young Richard Montgomery; just one-and-twenty;       Irish by birth; an humble officer in Wolfe's brigade; but       also a servant of humanity, enlisted in its corps of       immortals. The sagacity of Wolfe honored him with       well-deserved praise, and promotion to a lieutenancy. On the       morning of the 12th, an hour before dawn, Wolfe, with light       infantry and Highlanders, took by surprise the light-house       battery on the north-east side of the entrance to the       harbor; the smaller works were successively carried. On the       23d, the English battery began to play on that of the French       on the island near the centre of the mouth of the harbor.       Science, sufficient force, union among the officers,       heroism, pervading mariners and soldiers, carried forward       the siege, during which Barre by his conduct secured the       approbation of Amherst and the confirmed friendship of       Wolfe. Of the French ships in the port, three were burned on       the 21st of July; in the night following the 25th, the boats       of the squadron, with small loss, set fire to the Prudent, a       seventy-four, and carried off the Bienfaisant. Boscawen was       prepared to send six English ships into the harbor. But the       town of Louisburgh was already a heap of ruins; for eight       days, the French officers and men had had no safe place for       rest; of fifty-two cannon opposed to the English batteries       forty were disabled. The French had but five ships of the       line and four frigates. It was time for the Chevalier de       Drucour to capitulate. The garrison became prisoners of war,       and, with the sailors and marines, in all 5,637, were sent       to England. On the 27th of July, the English took possession       of Louisburgh, and, as a consequence, of Cape Breton and       Prince Edward's Island. Thus fell the power of France on our       eastern coast. Halifax being the English naval station,       Louisburgh was deserted. The harbor still offers shelter       from storms; the coast repels the surge: but a few hovels       only mark the spot which so much treasure was lavished to       fortify, so much heroism to conquer. Wolfe, whose heart was       in England, returned home with the love and esteem of the       army. His country was full of exultation; the trophies were       deposited with pomp in the cathedral of St. Paul's; the       churches gave thanks; Boscawen, himself a member of       parliament, was honored by a unanimous tribute from the       House of Commons. New England, too, triumphed; for the       praises awarded to Amherst and Wolfe recalled the heroism of       her own sons.\"    This success inspired Pitt to still greater efforts. He resolved to  annex the \"boundless north,\" as it was then called, to the British  empire in America; and early in the spring Wolfe again went out,--this  time, to conquer Quebec and find a soldier's grave. Many of his  companions in arms were then and afterwards famous men:--Jervis,  afterwards the renowned Earl St. Vincent, James Cook, the navigator,  George Townshend, Barre, and Colonel Howe.         \"On the 26th of June, the whole armament arrived, without       the least accident, off the Isle of Orleans, on which, the       next day, they disembarked. A little south of west the cliff       of Quebec was seen distinctly, seemingly impregnable, rising       precipitously in the midst of one of the grandest scenes in       nature. To protect this guardian citadel of New France,       Montcalm had of regular troops no more than six wasted       battalions; of Indian warriors few appeared, the wary       savages preferring the security of neutrals; the Canadian       militia gave him the superiority in numbers; but he put his       chief confidence in the natural strength of the country.       Above Quebec, the high promontory on which the upper town is       built expands into an elevated plain, having towards the       river the steepest acclivities. For nine miles or more above       the city, as far as Cape Rouge, every landing-place was       intrenched and protected. The river St. Charles, after       meandering through a fertile valley, sweeps the rocky base       of the town, which it covers by expanding into sedgy       marshes. Nine miles below Quebec, the impetuous Montmorenci,       after fretting itself a whirlpool route, and leaping for       miles down the steps of a rocky bed, rushes with velocity       towards the ledge, over which, falling two hundred and fifty       feet, it pours its fleecy cataract into the chasm. As Wolfe       disembarked on the Isle of Orleans, what scene could be more       imposing? On his left lay at anchor the fleet with the       numerous transports; the tents of his army stretched across       the island; the intrenched troops of France, having their       centre at the village of Beanport, extended from the       Montmorenci to the St. Charles; the city of Quebec,       garrisoned by five battalions, bounded the horizon. At       midnight on the 28th, the short darkness was lighted up by a       fleet of fire-ships, that, after a furious storm of wind,       came down with the tide in the proper direction. But the       British sailors grappled with them and towed them free of       the shipping. The river was Wolfe's; the men-of-war made it       so; and, being master of the deep water, he also had the       superiority on the south-shore of the St. Lawrence. In the       night of the 29th, Monckton, with four battalions, having       crossed the south channel, occupied Point Levi; and where       the mighty current, which below the town expands as a bay,       narrows to a deep stream of but a mile in width, batteries       of mortars and cannon were constructed. The citizens of       Quebec, foreseeing the ruin of their houses, volunteered to       pass over the river and destroy the works; but, at the       trial, their courage failed them, and they retreated. The       English, by the discharge of red-hot balls and shells, set       on fire fifty houses in a night, demolished the lower town,       and injured the upper. But the citadel was beyond their       reach, and every avenue from the river to the cliff was too       strongly intrenched for an assault.\"    The summer was going rapidly, and as yet no real progress had been made.  Wolfe was eager for action,--and he pursued his researches into the  nature of the formidable position with extraordinary eagerness:--         \"He saw that the eastern bank of the Montmorenci was higher       than the ground occupied by Montcalm, and, on the 9th of       July, he crossed the north channel and encamped there; but       the armies and their chiefs were still divided by the river       precipitating itself down its rocky way in impassable eddies       and rapids. Three miles in the interior, a ford was found;       but the opposite bank was steep, woody, and well intrenched.       Not a spot on the line of the Montmorenci for miles into the       interior, nor on the St. Lawrence to Quebec, was left       unprotected by the vigilance of the inaccessible Montcalm.       The General proceeded to reconnoitre the shore above the       town. In concert with Saunders, on the 18th of July, he       sailed along the well-defended bank from Montmorenci to the       St. Charles: he passed the deep and spacious harbor, which,       at four hundred miles from the sea, can shelter a hundred       ships of the line; he neared the high cliff of Cape Diamond,       towering like a bastion over the waters, and surmounted by       the banner of the Bourbons; he coasted along the craggy wall       of rock that extends beyond the citadel; he marked the       outline of the precipitous hill that forms the north bank of       the river,--and every where he beheld a natural fastness,       vigilantly defended, intrenchments, cannon, boats, and       floating batteries guarding every access. Had a detachment       landed between the city and Cape Rouge, it would have       encountered the danger of being cut off before it could       receive support. He would have risked a landing at St.       Michael's Cove, three miles above the city, but the enemy       prevented him by planting artillery and a mortar to play       upon the shipping. Meantime, at midnight,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3536"],[0,"The Enchanted Castle (#20)"],[1,"know a lodging,\" he said slowly, \"but ,\" The tallest of the  Ugly-Wuglies pushed forward. He was dressed in the old brown  overcoat and top-hat which always hung on the school hat-stand to  discourage possible burglars by deluding them into the idea that  there was a gentleman-of-the-house, and that he was at home. He  had an air at once more sporting and less reserved than that of the  first speaker, and anyone could see that he was not quite a  gentleman.    \"Wa I wo oo oh,\" he began, but the lady Ugly-Wugly in the  flower-wreathed hat interrupted him. She spoke more distinctly  than the others, owing, as Gerald found afterwards, to the fact that  her mouth had been drawn open, and the flap cut from the aperture  had been folded back so that she really had something like a roof  to her mouth, though it was only a paper one.    \"What I want to know,\" Gerald understood her to say, \"is where are  the carriages we ordered?\"    \"I don't know,\" said Gerald, \"but I'll find out. But we ought to be  moving,\" he added; \"you see, the performance is over, and they  want to shut up the house and put the lights out. Let's be moving.\"    \"Eh ech e oo-ig,\" repeated the respectable Ugly-Wugly, and  stepped towards the front door.    \"Oo urn oo,\" said the flower-wreathed one; and Gerald assures me  that her vermilion lips stretched in a smile.    \"I shall be delighted,\" said Gerald with earnest courtesy, \"to do  anything, of course. Things do happen so awkwardly when you  least expect it. I could go with you, and get you a lodging, if you'd  only wait a few moments in the in the yard. It's quite a superior  sort of yard, he went on, as a wave of surprised disdain passed over  their white paper faces not a common yard, you know; the pump,\"  he added madly, \"has just been painted green all over, and the  dustbin is enamelled iron.\"    The Ugly-Wuglies turned to each other in consultation, and Gerald  gathered that the greenness of the pump and the enamelled  character of the dustbin made, in their opinion, all the difference.    \"I'm awfully sorry,\" he urged eagerly, \"to have to ask you to wait,  but you see I've got an uncle who's quite mad, and I have to give  him his gruel at half-past nine. He won't feed out of any hand but  mine.\" Gerald did not mind what he said. The only people one is  allowed to tell lies to are the Ugly-Wuglies; they are all clothes  and have no insides, because they are not human beings, but only a  sort of very real visions, and therefore cannot be really deceived,  though they may seem to be.    Through the back door that has the blue, yellow, red, and green  glass in it, down the iron steps into the yard, Gerald led the way,  and the Ugly-Wuglies trooped after him. Some of them had boots,  but the ones whose feet were only broomsticks or umbrellas found  the open-work iron stairs very awkward.    \"If you wouldn't mind,\" said Gerald, \"just waiting under the  balcony? My uncle is so very mad. If he were to see see any  strangers I mean, even aristocratic ones I couldn't answer for the  consequences.\"    \"Perhaps, said the flower-hatted lady nervously, \"it would be better  for us to try and find a lodging ourselves?\"    \"I wouldn't advise you to,\" said Gerald as grimly as he knew how;  \"the police here arrest all strangers. It's the new law the Liberals  have just made,\" he added convincingly, \"and you'd get the sort of  lodging you wouldn't care for I couldn't bear to think of you in a  prison dungeon,\" he added tenderly.    \"I ah wi oo er papers,\" said the respectable Ugly-Wugly, and added  something that sounded like \"disgraceful state of things.\"    However, they ranged themselves under the iron balcony. Gerald  gave one last look at them and wondered, in his secret heart, why  he was not frightened, though in his outside mind he was  congratulating himself on his bravery. For the things did look  rather horrid. In that light it was hard to believe that they were  really only clothes and pillows and sticks with no insides. As he  went up the steps he heard them talking among themselves in that  strange language of theirs, all oo's and ah's; and he thought he  distinguished the voice of the respectable Ugly-Wugly saying,  \"Most gentlemanly lad,\" and the wreathed-hatted lady answering  warmly: \"Yes, indeed.\"    The coloured-glass door closed behind him. Behind him was the  yard, peopled by seven impossible creatures. Before him lay the  silent house, peopled, as he knew very well, by five human beings  as frightened as human beings could be. You think, perhaps, that  Ugly-Wuglies are nothing to be frightened of. That's only because  you have never seen one come alive. You must make one any old  suit of your father s, and a hat that he isn't wearing, a bolster or  two, a painted paper face, a few sticks and a pair of boots will do  the trick; get your father to lend you a wishing ring, give it back to  him when it has done its work, and see how you feel then.    Of course the reason why Gerald was not afraid was that he had  the ring; and, as you have seen, the wearer of that is not frightened  by anything unless he touches that thing. But Gerald knew well  enough how the others must be feeling. That was why he stopped  for a moment in the hall to try and imagine what would have been  most soothing to him if he had been as terrified as he knew they  were.    \"Cathy! I say! What ho, Jimmy! Mabel ahoy!\" he cried in a loud,  cheerful voice that sounded very unreal to himself.    The dining-room door opened a cautious inch.    \"I say such larks!\" Gerald went on, shoving gently at the door with  his shoulder. \"Look out! what are you keeping the door shut for?\"    \"Are you alone?\" asked Kathleen in hushed, breathless tones.    \"Yes, of course. Don't be a duffer!\"    The door opened, revealing three scared faces and the disarranged  chairs where that odd audience had sat.    \"Where are they? Have you unwished them? We heard them  talking. Horrible!\"    \"They're in the yard,\" said Gerald with the best imitation of joyous  excitement that he could manage. \"It is such fun! They're just like  real people, quite kind and jolly. It's the most ripping lark. Don't let  on to Mademoiselle and Eliza. I'll square them. Then Kathleen and  Jimmy must go to bed, and I'll see Mabel home, and as soon as we  get outside I must find some sort of lodging for the Ugly-Wuglies  they are such fun though. I do wish you could all go with me.\"    \"Fun?\" echoed Kathleen dismally and doubting.    \"Perfectly killing,\" Gerald asserted resolutely. \"Now, you just  listen to what I say to Mademoiselle and Eliza, and back me up for  all you're worth.    \"But,\" said Mabel, \"you can't mean that you're going to leave me  alone directly we get out, and go off with those horrible creatures.  They look like fiends.\"    \"You wait till you've seen them close,\" Gerald advised. \"Why, they  re just ordinary the first thing one of them did was to ask me to  recommend it to a good hotel! I couldn't understand it at first,  because it has no roof to its mouth, of course.\"    It was a mistake to say that, Gerald knew it at once.    Mabel and Kathleen were holding hands in a way that plainly  showed how a few moments ago they had been clinging to each  other in an agony of terror. Now they clung again. And Jimmy,  who was sitting on the edge of what had been the stage, kicking his  boots against the pink counterpane, shuddered visibly.    \"It doesn't matter,\" Gerald explained \"about the roofs, I mean; you  soon get to understand. I heard them say I was a gentlemanly lad as  I was coming away. They wouldn't have cared to notice a little  thing like that if they'd been fiends, you know.\"    \"It doesn't matter how gentlemanly they think you; if you don't see  me home you aren't, that's all. Are you going to?\" Mabel  demanded.    \"Of course I am. We shall have no end of a lark. Now for  Mademoiselle.\"    He had put on his coat as he spoke and now ran up the stairs. The  others, herding in the hall, could hear his light-hearted there  s-nothing-unusual-the-matter-whatever-did-you-bolt-like-that-for  knock at Mademoiselle's door, the reassuring \"It's only me Gerald,  you know,\" the pause, the opening of the door, and the low-voiced  parley that followed; then Mademoiselle and Gerald at Eliza's  door, voices of reassurance; Eliza's terror, bluntly voluble, tactfully  soothed.    \"Wonder what lies he's telling them,\" Jimmy grumbled.    \"Oh! not lies,\" said Mabel; \"he's only telling them as much of the  truth as it's good for them to know.\"    \"If you'd been a man,\" said Jimmy witheringly, \"you'd have been a  beastly Jesuit, and hid up chimneys.\"    \"If I were only just a boy,\" Mabel retorted, \"I shouldn't be scared  out of my life by a pack of old coats.\"    \"I'm so sorry you were frightened,\" Gerald's honeyed tones floated  down the staircase; \"we didn't think about you being frightened.  And it was a good trick, wasn't it?\"    \"There!\" whispered Jimmy, \"he's been telling her it was a trick of  ours.\"    \"Well, so it was,\" said Mabel stoutly.    \"It was indeed a wonderful trick,\" said Mademoiselle; \"and how  did you move the mannikins?\"    \"Oh, we've often done it with strings, you know,\" Gerald  explained.    \"That's true, too,\" Kathleen whispered.    \"Let us see you do once again this trick so remarkable,\" said  Mademoiselle, arriving at the bottom-stair mat.    \"Oh, I've cleared them all out,\" said Gerald. (\"So he has, from  Kathleen aside to Jimmy.) \"We were so sorry you were startled; we  thought you wouldn't like to see them again.\"    \"Then,\" said Mademoiselle brightly, as she peeped into the untidy  dining-room and saw that the figures had indeed vanished, \"if we  supped and discoursed of your beautiful piece of theatre?\"    Gerald explained fully how much his brother and sister would  enjoy this. As for him Mademoiselle would see that it was his duty  to escort Mabel home, and kind as it was of Mademoiselle to ask  her to stay the night, it"]]]
