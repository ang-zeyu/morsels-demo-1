[Headnote: POST-REFORMATION GRAMMAR SCHOOLS.]    That the post-Reformation Grammar Schools did not at first educate as  many boys as the old monastic schools is well known. Strype says,      \"On the 15th of January, 1562, Thomas Williams, of the Inner    Temple, esq. being chosen speaker to the lower house, was    presented to the queen: and in his speech to her ... took notice    of the want of schools; that at least an hundred were wanting in    England which before this time had been, [being destroyed    (I suppose he meant) by the dissolution of monasteries and    religious houses, fraternities and colleges.] He would have had    England continually flourishing with ten thousand scholars, which    the schools in this nation formerly brought up. That from the want    of these good schoolmasters sprang up ignorance: and covetousness    got the livings by impropriations; which was a decay, he said, of    learning, and by it the tree of knowledge grew downward, not    upward; which grew greatly to the dishonour, both of God and the    commonwealth. He mentioned likewise the decay of the universities;    and how that great market-towns were without schools or preachers:    and that the poor vicar had but 20_l._ [or some such poor    allowance,] and the rest, being no small sum, was impropriated.    And so thereby, no preacher there; but the people, being trained    up and led in blindness for want of instruction, became obstinate:    and therefore advised that this should be seen to, and    impropriations redressed, notwithstanding the laws already made    [which favoured them].--Strype, _Annals of the Reformation_, vol.    i. p. 437.    Of the Grammar Schools in his time (A.D. 1577) Harrison says:      Besides these universities, also there are a great number of    Grammer Schooles throughout the realme, and those verie liberallie    endued for the better relief of pore scholers, so that there are    not manie corporate townes, now under the queene's dominion that    have not one Gramer Schole at the least, with a sufficient living    for a master and usher appointed to the same.      There are in like manner divers collegiat churches, as Windsor,    Wincester, Eaton, Westminster (in which I was sometime an    unprofitable Grammarian under the reverend father, master Nowell,    now dean of Paules) and in those a great number of pore scholers,    dailie maintained by the liberality of the founders, with meat,    bookes, and apparell; from whence after they have been well    entered in the knowledge of the Latine and Greek tongs, and rules    of versifying (the triall whereof is made by certain apposers,    yearlie appointed to examine them), they are sent to certain    especiall houses in each universitie[79], where they are received    & trained up in the points of higher knowledge in their privat    halls till they be adjudged meet to show their faces in the    schooles, as I have said alreadie.        [Headnote: STUDY OF ENGLISH RECOMMENDED IN 1582-1612.]    Greek was first taught at a public school in England by Lillye soon  after the year 1500. This was at St Paul's School in London, then newly  established by Dean Colet, and to which Erasmus alluded as the best of  its time in 1514, when he said that he had in three years taught a youth  more Latin than he could have acquired in any school in England, _ne  Liliana quidem excepta_, not even Lillye's excepted. (Warton, iii. 1.)  The first schoolmaster who stood up for the study of English was,  I believe, Richard Mulcaster, of King's College, Cambridge, and Christ  Church, Oxford. In 1561 he was appointed the first head-master of  Merchant-Taylors School in London, then just founded as a feeder or  pro-seminary for St John's College, Oxford (_Warton_, iii. 282). In his  Elementarie, 1582, he has a long passage on the study of English, the  whole of which I print here, at Mr Quick's desire, as it has slipt out  of people's minds, and Mulcaster deserves honour for it:--      \"But bycause I take vpon me in this Elementarie, besides som    frindship to secretaries for the pen, and to correctors for the    print, to direct such peple as teach childern to read and write    English, and the _reading_ must nedes be such as the writing leads    vnto, thererfor, (_sic_) befor I medle with anie particular    precept, to direct the Reader, I will thoroughlie rip vp the hole    certaintie of our English writing, so far furth and with such    assurance, as probabilitie can make me, bycause it is a thing both    proper to my argument, and profitable to my cuntrie. For our    naturall tung being as beneficiall vnto vs for our nedefull    deliuerie, as anie other is to the peple which vse it: & hauing as    pretie, and as fair obseruations in it, as anie other hath: and    being as readie to yield to anie rule of Art, as anie other is:    why should I not take som pains to find out the right writing of    ours, as other cuntrimen haue don to find the like in theirs? & so    much the rather, bycause it is pretended, that the writing thereof    is meruellous vncertain, and scant to be recouered from extreme    confusion, without som change of as great extremitie? I mean    therefor so to deall in it, as I maie wipe awaie that opinio{n} of    either vncertaintie for co{n}fusion, or impossibilitie for    directio{n}, that both the naturall English maie haue wherein to    rest, & the desirous st[r]anger maie haue whereby to learn. For    the performa{n}ce whereof, and mine own better direction, I will    first examin those means, whereby other tungs of most sacred    antiquitie haue bene brought to Art and form of discipline for    their right writing, to the end that by following their waie,    I maie hit vpo{n} their right, and at the least by their president    deuise the like to theirs, where the vse of our tung, & the    propertie of our dialect will not yeild flat to theirs. That don,    I will set all the varietie of our now writing, & the vncertaine    force of all our letters, in as much certaintie, as anie writing    ca{n} be, by these sene{n} precepts,-- 1. _Generall rule_, which    concerneth the propertie and vse of ech letter: 2. _Proportion_    which reduceth all words of one sou{n}d to the same writing:    3. _Composition_, which teacheth how to write one word made of mo:    4. _Deriuation_, which examineth the ofspring of euerie originall:    5. _Distinction_ which bewraieth the difference of sound and force    in letters by som writen figure or accent: 6. _Enfranchisment_,    which directeth the right writing of all incorporat foren words:    7. _Prerogatiue_, which declareth a reseruation, wherein common    vse will continew hir precèdence in our En[g]lish writing, as she    hath don euerie where else, both for the form of the letter, in    som places, which likes the pen better: and for the difference in    writing, where som particular caueat will chek a common rule. In    all these seuen I will so examin the particularities of our tung,    as either nothing shall seme strange at all, or if anie thing do    seme, yet it shall not seme so strange, but that either the self    same, or the verie like vnto it, or the more strange then it is,    shal appear to be in, those things, which ar more familiar vnto vs    for extraordinarie learning, then required of vs for our ordinarie    vse. And forasmuch as the eie will help manie to write right by a    sene president, which either cannot vnderstand, or cannot entend    to vnderstand the reason of a rule, therefor in the end of this    treatis for right writing, I purpos to set down a generall table    of most English words, by waie of president, to help such plane    peple, as cannot entend the vnderstanding of a rule, which    requireth both time and conceit in perceiuing, but can easilie run    to a generall table, which is readier to their hand. By the which    table I shall also confirm the right of my rules, that theie hold    thoroughout, & by multitude of exa{m}ples help som maim (_so_) in    precepts. Thus much for the right writing of our English tung,    which maie seme (_so_) for a preface to the principle of    _Reading_, as the matter of the one is the maker of the    other.--1582. Rich^d. Mulcaster. The First Part of the    Elementarie, pp. 53-4.    Brinsley follows Mulcaster in exhorting to the study of English:      \"there seemes vnto mee, to bee a verie maine want in all our    Grammar schooles generally, or in the most of them; whereof I haue    heard som great learned men to complain; That there is no care had    in respect, to traine vp schollars so as they may be able to    expresse their minds purely and readily in our owne tongue, and to    increase in the practice of it, as well as in the Latine or    Greeke; whereas our chiefe indeuour should bee for it, and that    for these reasons. 1. Because that language which all sorts and    conditions of men amongst vs are to haue most vse of, both in    speech & writing, is our owne natiue tongue. 2. The purity and    elegancie of our owne language is to be esteemed a chiefe part of    the honour of our nation: which we all ought to aduance as much as    in vs lieth. As when Greece and Rome and other nations haue most    florished, their languages also haue beene most pure: and from    those times of Greece & Rome, wee fetch our chiefest patterns, for    the learning of their tongues. 3. Because of those which are for a    time trained vp in schooles, there are very fewe which proceede in    learning, in comparison of them that follow other callings.

He said I should come to you, though it was twenty long miles  farther.\"    \"Ach! den now I shall go und shmoke mein piggest bibe for a dreat.  Dot  does me goot.  Oom Schlagen is a pig fool; zo ist effery man who does  not lofe his neighbour and zay his brayers effery night.  You  oondershtand, mein younger vriend.\"    Dyke nodded, feeling at first half amused, then impressed by the  simple-hearted old German's manner.    \"Zom men gome out here into die veldt and zay: `Ach! it is a pig open  blace, und nopody gan zee me here, und I zhall do whad I like,' und den  dey rob und sheat, und kill die plack poys, und drink more as ist goot  for demselfs, und all pecause they are pig fools.

Now you look here.  I dell you about die  diamonds--und der is hartly any potty yet as know--und as zoon as I haf  dell you, I zay to myselfs: `Ach!

Two pleasant, restful days under the green leaves at old Morgenstern's  farm and store, and he was pressed to stay another; but Dyke was anxious  to get back to his brother, and with Duke limping about, the horse and  bullocks looking quite fresh and well, everything loaded up carefully,  and a cask of sweet, pure water slung at the back of the wagon, Dyke  stood at early dawn ready to start.    The oxen were yoked and hitched on to the dissel-boom and trek tow,  breakfast was over, and all was ready, with Jack flourishing his great  long whip of hippopotamus hide, eager to start.    Just then the hospitable old German signed to the Kaffir to come  alongside, and a chirrup brought up the dog as well.    \"Now, mein vrient,\" said the old man, \"you gan oondershtand goot  Englisch, if you gannot shpeak him zo vel ash me, zo you listen.  I am a  creat magistrate, und know a lot.  I am going to dalk to dot tog, und  you are to hear.--Now, my goot tog, you are better as effer you vas,  heh?\"    Duke barked.    \"Das ist goot.  Now you are going to Kopfontein.\"    The dog barked loudly.    \"Das ist good, too.  Now I dell you dis: if Kaffir Jack--you know Kaffir  Jack--dot is him.\"    He clapped his hand on the black's shoulder, and the dog barked  excitedly.    \"Yaas, you know him; und I dell you dot if he does not work, you are to  bide him.\"    The dog's hair rose up, and Jack made a movement to run, but the big fat  hand held him fast.    \"Und then, mein goot tog, if you do dot, he vill be ferry pad, und  perhaps go mad.  I mean, if you bide him, hey?\"    The dog barked furiously, and Jack's blackish face turned of a horrible  dirty grey as he stood shivering, having pretty well understood every  word.    \"Dot is right; und now Kaffir Jack will drive die oxen, und pe a goot  poy.  Now you go.  _Trek_!\"    The Kaffir sprang away, whip in hand, the willing oxen began to pull,  and the wagon went off through the soft sand, Duke hurrying to his place  beneath, just in front of the water cask, while Dyke stood, rein in  hand, waiting to shake hands with his host, who laughed softly.    \"I dalk all dot nonsense do vrighten him like a shild,\" he said.  \"He  vill pe a goot poy now till he begin to forget, und den you must  vrighten him doo.  Now goot-pye, und der goot God bless you, mein sohn.\"    Dyke shook hands warmly with the friendly old man, sprang upon Breezy,  and soon overtook the wagon, which was going steadily along the faint  track.    He glanced back several times, seeing the old trader standing in front  of his house smoking his big pipe, but at last he was invisible, and the  boy set himself to achieve his long, slow, five or six days' journey,  hopeful, rested, and ready, feeling as if all was going to be right, and  more happy in his mind than he had been for days.    As he went on and on, fresh, light-hearted, and bright, every place made  familiar by halts as he came, wore a very different aspect, and there  were times when he smiled at some of the petty vexations, though others  were serious enough.  For instance, by this water, where he had had so  much difficulty in getting wood, for the day's journey had been very  long, and it was growing dark when he halted, and a distant roar told of  the possibility of a visit from lions, and perhaps the loss of one of  the bullocks.  But now all was smooth and pleasant, the evening was  glorious, the oxen not too weary, and Jack soon collected enough wood  for cooking and keeping up a roaring blaze.    The next day, too, was hot and pleasant.  Several guinea-fowl fell to  Dyke's gun, and he shot a dangerous viper which raised its head  sluggishly from the sandy track, threatening, with gleaming eyes and  vibrating tongue, the barking dog, which kept cautiously beyond striking  distance.  There were lions heard in the night, making the cattle  uneasy, but they were not molested.    It was wonderful as a contrast that journey back, and Dyke often asked  himself, as he cantered about, sometimes to the side, sometimes letting  the wagon go for some distance forward, whether he had not been of poor  heart, and had made too much fuss over his troubles; but second thoughts  convinced him that he had had a terrible task, and he almost wondered  that he had been able to reach Morgenstern's at all.    Jack was the very perfection of a Kaffir servant now, driving  splendidly, and taking the greatest care as to the pasturing and  watering of the cattle; his young master never having to find fault with  a single thing.    But there was the reason plainly enough; and Dyke smiled to himself as  he thought of how easily the black had been impressed by the big old  German, though he felt that Jack's guilty conscience had something to do  with it.    Oddly enough, the dog's behaviour during the return journey helped to  keep Jack in order.  For Duke, though his hurts were mending fast, was  still very weak.  He was ready to bark and make plenty of fuss over his  master, but he did not evince the slightest desire to trot after him  when he rode away from the wagon.  Duke seemed to know his own powers,  and went back directly to his place between the two hind wheels of the  wagon.  There he stayed, keeping step pretty well with the bullocks.  But at every halt, when Jack proceeded to gather wood, drive the oxen to  water or pasture, the dog followed close at his heels, making no  demonstration of friendliness, never barking, but walking with lowered  head and surly look, just behind, stopping when the black did, going on  or returning, and never leaving him for a moment, and ending by going  back to his place under the wagon, and there resting his head upon his  paws.    Of course, all this was the sick dog's natural objection to being left  alone; but to Jack it meant a great deal more.  That dog had always been  rather unfriendly, and was evidently a very uncanny kind of beast, which  could understand everything that was said to him, and would fully carry  out the old German's instructions."]]]
