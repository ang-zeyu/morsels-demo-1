Isolated from her beloved companions, Idun pined, grew pale and sad,  but persistently refused to give Thiassi the smallest bite of her  magic fruit, which, as he well knew, would make him beautiful and  renew his strength and youth.              \"All woes that fall          On Odin's hall      Can be traced to Loki base.        From out Valhalla's portal      'Twas he who pure Iduna lured,--          Whose casket fair          Held apples rare        That render gods immortal,--      And in Thiassi's tower immured.\"                Valhalla (J. C. Jones).      Time passed. The gods, thinking that Idun had accompanied her husband  and would soon return, at first paid no heed to her departure, but  little by little the beneficent effect of the last feast of apples  passed away. They began to feel the approach of old age, and saw  their youth and beauty disappear; so, becoming alarmed, they began  to search for the missing goddess.    Close investigation revealed the fact that she had last been seen in  Loki's company, and when Odin sternly called him to account, he was  forced to admit that he had betrayed her into the storm-giant's power.          \"By his mocking, scornful mien,      Soon in Valhal it was seen      'Twas the traitor Loki's art      Which had led Idun apart      To gloomy tower      And Jotun power.\"                Valhalla (J. C. Jones).        The Return of Idun    The attitude of the gods now became very menacing, and it was clear  to Loki that if he did not devise means to restore the goddess,  and that soon, his life would be in considerable danger.    He assured the indignant gods, therefore, that he would leave no  stone unturned in his efforts to secure the release of Idun, and,  borrowing Freya's falcon plumage, he flew off to Thrym-heim, where  he found Idun alone, sadly mourning her exile from Asgard and her  beloved Bragi. Changing the fair goddess into a nut according to  some accounts, or according to others, into a swallow, Loki grasped  her tightly between his claws, and then rapidly retraced his way to  Asgard, hoping that he would reach the shelter of its high walls ere  Thiassi returned from a fishing excursion in the Northern seas to  which he had gone.    Meantime the gods had assembled on the ramparts of the heavenly  city, and they were watching for the return of Loki with far more  anxiety than they had felt for Odin when he went in search of  Od-hroerir. Remembering the success of their ruse on that occasion,  they had gathered great piles of fuel, which they were ready to set  on fire at any moment.    Suddenly they saw Loki coming, but descried in his wake a great  eagle. This was the giant Thiassi who had suddenly returned to  Thrym-heim and found that his captive had been carried off by a falcon,  in whom he readily recognised one of the gods. Hastily donning his  eagle plumes he had given immediate chase and was rapidly overtaking  his prey. Loki redoubled his efforts as he neared the walls of Asgard,  and ere Thiassi overtook him he reached the goal and sank exhausted in  the midst of the gods. Not a moment was lost in setting fire to the  accumulated fuel, and as the pursuing Thiassi passed over the walls  in his turn, the flames and smoke brought him to the ground crippled  and half stunned, an easy prey to the gods, who fell ruthlessly upon  him and slew him.    The AEsir were overjoyed at the recovery of Idun, and they hastened  to partake of the precious apples which she had brought safely  back. Feeling the return of their wonted strength and good looks with  every mouthful they ate, they good-naturedly declared that it was  no wonder if even the giants longed to taste the apples of perpetual  youth. They vowed therefore that they would place Thiassi's eyes as  a constellation in the heavens, in order to soften any feeling of  anger which his kinsmen might experience upon learning that he had  been slain.          \"Up I cast the eyes      Of Allvaldi's son      Into the heaven's serene:      They are signs the greatest      Of my deeds.\"                Lay of Harbard (Thorpe's tr.).        The Goddess of Spring    The physical explanation of this myth is obvious. Idun, the emblem of  vegetation, is forcibly carried away in autumn, when Bragi is absent  and the singing of the birds has ceased. The cold wintry wind, Thiassi,  detains her in the frozen, barren north, where she cannot thrive,  until Loki, the south wind, brings back the seed or the swallow,  which are both precursors of the returning spring. The youth, beauty,  and strength conferred by Idun are symbolical of Nature's resurrection  in spring after winter's sleep, when colour and vigour return to the  earth, which had grown wrinkled and grey.        Idun Falls to the Nether World    As the disappearance of Idun (vegetation) was a yearly occurrence,  we might expect to find other myths dealing with the striking  phenomenon, and there is another favourite of the old scalds which,  unfortunately, has come down to us only in a fragmentary and very  incomplete form. According to this account, Idun was once sitting upon  the branches of the sacred ash Yggdrasil when, growing suddenly faint,  she loosed her hold and dropped to the ground beneath, and down to  the lowest depths of Nifl-heim. There she lay, pale and motionless,  gazing with fixed and horror-struck eyes upon the gruesome sights  of Hel's realm, trembling violently the while, like one overcome by  penetrating cold.          \"In the dales dwells      The prescient Dis,      From Yggdrasil's      Ash sunk down,      Of alfen race,      Idun by name,      The youngest of Ivaldi's      Elder children.      She ill brooked      Her descent      Under the hoar tree's      Trunk confined.      She would not happy be      With Norvi's daughter,      Accustomed to a pleasanter      Abode at home.\"                Odin's Ravens' Song (Thorpe's tr.).      Seeing that she did not return, Odin bade Bragi, Heimdall, and another  of the gods go in search of her, giving them a white wolfskin to  envelop her in, so that she should not suffer from the cold, and  bidding them make every effort to rouse her from the stupor which  his prescience told him had taken possession of her.          \"A wolf's skin they gave her,      In which herself she clad.\"                Odin's Ravens' Song (Thorpe's tr.).      Idun passively allowed the gods to wrap her in the warm wolfskin,  but she persistently refused to speak or move, and from her strange  manner her husband sadly suspected that she had had a vision of great  ills. The tears ran continuously down her pallid cheeks, and Bragi,  overcome by her unhappiness, at length bade the other gods return  to Asgard without him, vowing that he would remain beside his wife  until she was ready to leave Hel's dismal realm. The sight of her  woe oppressed him so sorely that he had no heart for his usual merry  songs, and the strings of his harp were mute while he remained in  the underworld.          \"That voice-like zephyr o'er flow'r meads creeping,      Like Bragi's music his harp strings sweeping.\"                Viking Tales of the North (R. B. Anderson).      In this myth Idun's fall from Yggdrasil is symbolical of the autumnal  falling of the leaves, which lie limp and helpless on the cold bare  ground until they are hidden from sight under the snow, represented  by the wolfskin, which Odin, the sky, sends down to keep them warm;  and the cessation of the birds' songs is further typified by Bragi's  silent harp.              CHAPTER VIII: NIOeRD      A Hostage with the Gods    We have already seen how the AEsir and Vanas exchanged hostages after  the terrible war they had waged against each other, and that while  Hoenir, Odin's brother, went to live in Vana-heim, Nioerd, with his  two children, Frey and Freya, definitely took up his abode in Asgard.          \"In Vana-heim      Wise powers him created,      And to the gods a hostage gave.\"                Lay of Vafthrudnir (Thorpe's tr.).      As ruler of the winds, and of the sea near the shore, Nioerd was  given the palace of Noatun, near the seashore, where, we are told, he  stilled the terrible tempests stirred up by AEgir, god of the deep sea.          \"Nioerd, the god of storms, whom fishers know;      Not born in Heaven--he was in Van-heim rear'd,      With men, but lives a hostage with the gods;      He knows each frith, and every rocky creek      Fringed with dark pines, and sands where sea-fowl scream.\"                Balder Dead (Matthew Arnold).      He also extended his special protection over commerce and fishing,  which two occupations could be pursued with advantage only during  the short summer months, of which he was in a measure considered  the personification.        The God of Summer    Nioerd is represented in art as a very handsome god, in the prime  of life, clad in a short green tunic, with a crown of shells and  seaweed upon his head, or a brown-brimmed hat adorned with eagle or  heron plumes. As personification of the summer, he was invoked to  still the raging storms which desolated the coasts during the winter  months. He was also implored to hasten the vernal warmth and thereby  extinguish the winter fires.    As agriculture was practised only during the summer months, and  principally along the fiords or sea inlets, Nioerd was also invoked  for favourable harvests, for he was said to delight in prospering  those who placed their trust in him.    Nioerd's first wife, according to some authorities, was his sister  Nerthus, Mother Earth, who in Germany was identified with Frigga, as we  have seen, but in Scandinavia was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2850"],[0,"The Wars of the Jews; Or, The History of the Destruction of Jerusalem (#20)"],[1,"that Cleopatra was a  shrewd woman, and that on her account Lysanias the king was taken off,  as well as Malichus the Arabian; for his fear did not only extend to the  dissolving of his marriage, but to the danger of his life.    4. When therefore he was about to take a journey abroad, he committed  his wife to Joseph, his sister Salome's husband, as to one who would be  faithful to him, and bare him good-will on account of their kindred; he  also gave him a secret injunction, that if Antony slew him, he should  slay her. But Joseph, without any ill design, and only in order to  demonstrate the king's love to his wife, how he could not bear to think  of being separated from her, even by death itself, discovered this grand  secret to her; upon which, when Herod was come back, and as they talked  together, and he confirmed his love to her by many oaths, and assured  her that he had never such an affection for any other woman as he had  for her--\"Yes,\" says she, \"thou didst, to be sure, demonstrate thy love  to me by the injunctions thou gavest Joseph, when thou commandedst him  to kill me.\" 37    5. When he heard that this grand secret was discovered, he was like a  distracted man, and said that Joseph would never have disclosed that  injunction of his, unless he had debauched her. His passion also made  him stark mad, and leaping out of his bed, he ran about the palace after  a wild manner; at which time his sister Salome took the opportunity  also to blast her reputation, and confirmed his suspicion about Joseph;  whereupon, out of his ungovernable jealousy and rage, he commanded both  of them to be slain immediately; but as soon as ever his passion was  over, he repented of what he had done, and as soon as his anger was  worn off, his affections were kindled again. And indeed the flame of his  desires for her was so ardent, that he could not think she was dead, but  would appear, under his disorders, to speak to her as if she were  still alive, till he were better instructed by time, when his grief and  trouble, now she was dead, appeared as great as his affection had been  for her while she was living.              CHAPTER 23.           Calumnies Against The Sons Of Mariamne. Antipateris       Preferred Before Them. They Are Accused Before Caesar, And       Herod Is Reconciled To Them.    1. Now Mariamne's sons were heirs to that hatred which had been borne  their mother; and when they considered the greatness of Herod's crime  towards her, they were suspicious of him as of an enemy of theirs; and  this first while they were educated at Rome, but still more when they  were returned to Judea. This temper of theirs increased upon them  as they grew up to be men; and when they were Come to an age fit for  marriage, the one of them married their aunt Salome's daughter, which  Salome had been the accuser of their mother; the other married the  daughter of Archelaus, king of Cappadocia. And now they used boldness  in speaking, as well as bore hatred in their minds. Now those that  calumniated them took a handle from such their boldness, and certain  of them spake now more plainly to the king that there were treacherous  designs laid against him by both his sons; and he that was son-in-law to  Archelaus, relying upon his father-in-law, was preparing to fly away, in  order to accuse Herod before Caesar; and when Herod's head had been long  enough filled with these calumnies, he brought Antipater, whom he had by  Doris, into favor again, as a defense to him against his other sons, and  began all the ways he possibly could to prefer him before them.    2. But these sons were not able to bear this change in their affairs;  but when they saw him that was born of a mother of no family, the  nobility of their birth made them unable to contain their indignation;  but whensoever they were uneasy, they showed the anger they had at  it. And as these sons did day after day improve in that their anger,  Antipater already exercised all his own abilities, which were very  great, in flattering his father, and in contriving many sorts of  calumnies against his brethren, while he told some stories of them  himself, and put it upon other proper persons to raise other stories  against them, till at length he entirely cut his brethren off from all  hopes of succeeding to the kingdom; for he was already publicly put into  his father's will as his successor. Accordingly, he was sent with royal  ornaments, and other marks of royalty, to Caesar, excepting the diadem.  He was also able in time to introduce his mother again into Mariamne's  bed. The two sorts of weapons he made use of against his brethren were  flattery and calumny, whereby he brought matters privately to such a  pass, that the king had thoughts of putting his sons to death.    3. So the father drew Alexander as far as Rome, and charged him with an  attempt of poisoning him before Caesar. Alexander could hardly speak for  lamentation; but having a judge that was more skillful than Antipater,  and more wise than Herod, he modestly avoided laying any imputation upon  his father, but with great strength of reason confuted the calumnies  laid against him; and when he had demonstrated the innocency of his  brother, who was in the like danger with himself, he at last bewailed  the craftiness of Antipater, and the disgrace they were under. He was  enabled also to justify himself, not only by a clear conscience, which  he carried within him, but by his eloquence; for he was a shrewd man  in making speeches. And upon his saying at last, that if his father  objected this crime to them, it was in his power to put them to death,  he made all the audience weep; and he brought Caesar to that pass, as  to reject the accusations, and to reconcile their father to them  immediately. But the conditions of this reconciliation were these,  that they should in all things be obedient to their father, and that he  should have power to leave the kingdom to which of them he pleased.    4. After this the king came back from Rome, and seemed to have forgiven  his sons upon these accusations; but still so that he was not without  his suspicions of them. They were followed by Antipater, who was the  fountain-head of those accusations; yet did not he openly discover his  hatred to them, as revering him that had reconciled them. But as Herod  sailed by Cilicia, he touched at Eleusa, 38 where Archelaus treated them  in the most obliging manner, and gave him thanks for the deliverance of  his son-in-law, and was much pleased at their reconciliation; and this  the more, because he had formerly written to his friends at Rome that  they should be assisting to Alexander at his trial. So he conducted  Herod as far as Zephyrium, and made him presents to the value of thirty  talents.    5. Now when Herod was come to Jerusalem, he gathered the people  together, and presented to them his three sons, and gave them an  apologetic account of his absence, and thanked God greatly, and  thanked Caesar greatly also, for settling his house when it was under  disturbances, and had procured concord among his sons, which was of  greater consequence than the kingdom itself,--\"and which I will render  still more firm; for Caesar hath put into my power to dispose of the  government, and to appoint my successor. Accordingly, in way of requital  for his kindness, and in order to provide for mine own advantage, I do  declare that these three sons of mine shall be kings. And, in the first  place, I pray for the approbation of God to what I am about; and, in the  next place, I desire your approbation also. The age of one of them, and  the nobility of the other two, shall procure them the succession. Nay,  indeed, my kingdom is so large that it may be sufficient for more kings.  Now do you keep those in their places whom Caesar hath joined, and their  father hath appointed; and do not you pay undue or unequal respects to  them, but to every one according to the prerogative of their births;  for he that pays such respects unduly, will thereby not make him that is  honored beyond what his age requires so joyful, as he will make him  that is dishonored sorrowful. As for the kindred and friends that are  to converse with them, I will appoint them to each of them, and will so  constitute them, that they may be securities for their concord; as  well knowing that the ill tempers of those with whom they converse will  produce quarrels and contentions among them; but that if these with  whom they converse be of good tempers, they will preserve their natural  affections for one another. But still I desire that not these only, but  all the captains of my army, have for the present their hopes placed on  me alone; for I do not give away my kingdom to these my sons, but give  them royal honors only; whereby it will come to pass that they will  enjoy the sweet parts of government as rulers themselves, but that the  burden of administration will rest upon myself whether I will or not.  And let every one consider what age I am of, how I have conducted my  life, and what piety I have exercised; for my age is not so great that  men may soon expect the end of my life; nor have I indulged such a  luxurious way of living as cuts men off when they are young; and we  have been so religious towards God, that we [have reason to hope we] may  arrive at a very great age. But for such as cultivate a friendship with  my sons, so as to aim at my destruction, they shall be punished by me  on their account. I am not one who envy my own children, and therefore  forbid men to pay them great respect; but I know that such [extravagant]  respects are the way to make them insolent. And if every one that comes  near them does but revolve this in his mind, that if he prove a good  man, he shall receive a reward from me, but that if he prove seditious,  his ill-intended complaisance shall get him nothing from him to whom it  is shown, I suppose they will all be of"]]]
