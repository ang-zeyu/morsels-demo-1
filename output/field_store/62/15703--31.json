Further, after doing for Manua Sera, they were  determined to go on to Ugogo to assist Salem bin Saif and the other  merchants on, during which, at the same time, they would fight all the  Wagogo who persisted in taking taxes and in harassing caravans. At the  advice of Musa, I sent Maula's son off at night to tell the old chief  how sorry I was to find the Arabs so hot-headed I could not even effect  an arrangement with them. It was a great pity; for Manua Sera was so  much liked by the Wanyamuezi, they would, had they been able, have done  anything to restore him.    Next day the non-belligerent Arabs left in charge of the station, headed  by my old friends Abdulla and Mohinna, came to pay their respects again,  recognising in me, as they said, a \"personification of their sultan,\"  and therefore considering what they were doing only due to my rank. They  regretted with myself that Snay was so hot-headed; for they themselves  thought a treaty of peace would have been the best thing for them, for  they were more than half-ruined already, and saw no hope for the  future. Then, turning to geography, I told Abdulla all I had written  and lectured in England concerning his stories about navigators on the  N'yanza, which I explained must be the Nile, and wished to know if I  should alter it in any way: but he said, \"Do not; you may depend it will  all turn out right;\" to which Musa added, all the people in the north  told him that when the N'yanza rose, the stream rushed with such  violence it tore up islands and floated them away.    I was puzzled at this announcement, not then knowing that both the lake  and the Nile, as well as all ponds, were called N'yanza: but we shall  see afterwards that he was right; and it was in consequence of this  confusion in the treatment of distinctly different geographical features  under one common name by these people, that in my former journey I  could not determine where the lake had ended and the Nile began. Abdulla  again--he had done so on the former journey--spoke to me of a wonderful  mountain to the northward of Karague, so high and steep no one could  ascend it. It was, he said, seldom visible, being up in the clouds,  where white matter, snow or hail, often fell. Musa said this hill was in  Ruanda, a much larger country than Urundi; and further, both men  said, as they had said before, that the lands of Usoga and Unyoro were  islands, being surrounded by water; and a salt lake, which was called  N'yanza, though not the great Victoria N'yanza lay on the other said of  the Unyoro, from which direction Rumanika, king of Karague, sometimes  got beads forwarded to him by Kamrasi, king of Unyoro, of a different  sort from any brought from Zanzibar. Moreover, these beads were said to  have been plundered from white men by the Wakidi,--a stark-naked people  who live up in trees--have small stools fixed on behind, always ready  for sitting--wear their hair hanging down as far as the rump, all  covered with cowrie-shells--suspend beads from wire attached to their  ears and their lower lips--and wear strong iron collars and bracelets.    This people, I was told, are so fierce in war that no other tribe can  stand against them, though they only fight with short spears. When this  discourse was ended, ever perplexed about the Tanganyika being a still  lake, I enquired of Mohinna and other old friends what they thought  about the Marungu river: did it run into or out of the lake? and they  all still adhered to its running into the lake--which, after all, in my  mind, is the most conclusive argument that it does run out of the lake,  making it one of a chain of lakes leading to the N'yanza, and through  it by the Zambezi into the sea; for all the Arabs on the former journey  said the Rusizi river ran out of the Tanganyika, as also the Kitangule  ran out of the N'yanza, and the Nile ran into it, even though Snay said  he thought the Jub river drained the N'yanza. All these statements  were, when literally translated into English, the reverse of what  the speakers, using a peculiar Arab idiom, meant to say; for all the  statements made as to the flow of rivers by the negroes--who apparently  give the same meaning to \"out\" and \"in\" as we do--contradicted the Arabs  in their descriptions of the direction of the flow of these rivers.    Mohinna now gave us a very graphic description of his fight with  Short-legs, the late chief of Khoko. About a year ago, as he was making  his way down to the coast with his ivory merchandise, on arrival at  Khoko, and before his camp was fortified with a ring-fence of thorns,  some of his men went to drink at a well, where they no sooner arrived  than the natives began to bean them with sticks, claiming the well as  their property. This commenced a row, which brought out a large body  of men, who demanded a bullock at the point of their spears. Mohinna  hearing this, also came to the well, and said he would not listen to  their demand, but would drink as he wished, for the water was the gift  of God. Words then changed to blows. All Mohinna's pagazis bolted, and  his merchandise fell into the hands of the Wagogo. Had his camp been  fortified, he think he would have been too much for his enemies; but,  as it was, he retaliated by shooting Short-legs in the head, and at once  bolted back to Kaze with a few slaves as followers, and his three wives.    The change that had taken place in Unyanyembe since I last left it was  quite surprising. Instead of the Arabs appearing merchants, as they  did formerly, they looked more like great farmers, with huge stalls of  cattle attached to their houses; whilst the native villages were all  in ruins--so much so that, to obtain corn for my men, I had to send out  into the district several days' journey off, and even then had to pay  the most severe famine prices for what I got. The Wanyamuezi, I was  assured, were dying of starvation in all directions; for, in addition  to the war, the last rainy season had been so light, all their crops had  failed.    27th and 28th.--I now gave all my men presents for the severe trials  they had experienced in the wilderness, forgetting, as I told them, the  merciless manner in which they had plundered me; but as I have a trifle  more in proportion, to the three sole remaining pagazis, because they  had not finished their work, my men were all discontented, and wished  to throw back their presents, saying I did not love them, although they  were \"perminents,\" as much as the \"temperaries.\" They, however, gave  in, after some hours of futile arguments, on my making them understand,  through Baraka, that what they saw me give to the pagazis would, if they  reflected, only tend to prove to them that I was not a bad master who  forgot his obligations when he could get no more out of his servants.    I then went into a long inquiry with Musa about our journey northward  to Karague; and as he said there were no men to be found in or near  Unyanyembe, for they were either all killed or engaged in the war, it  was settled he should send some of his head men on to Rungua, where he  had formerly resided, trading for some years, and was a great favourite  with the chief of the place, by name Kiringuana. He also settled that  I might take out of his establishment of slaves as many men as I could  induce to go with me, for he thought them more trouble than profit,  hired porters being more safe; moreover, he said the plan would be of  great advantage to him, as I offered to pay, both man and master, each  the same monthly stipend as I gave my present men. This was paying  double, and all the heavier a burden, as the number I should require to  complete my establishment to one hundred armed men would be sixty. He,  however, very generously advised me not to take them, as they would give  so much trouble; but finally gave way when I told him I felt I could  not advance beyond Karague unless I was quite independent of the natives  there--a view in which he concurred.    29th and 30th.--Jafu, another Indian merchant here, and co-partner of  Musa, came in from a ten days' search after grain, and described the  whole country to be in the most dreadful state of famine. Wanyamuezi  were lying about dead from starvation in all directions, and he did not  think we should ever get through Usui, as Suwarora, the chief, was so  extortionate he would \"tear us to pieces\"; but advised our waiting until  the war was settled, when all the Arabs would combine and go with us.  Musa even showed fear, but arranged, at my suggestion, that he should  send some men to Rumanika, informing him of our intention to visit him,  and begging, at the same time, he would use his influence in preventing  our being detained in Usui.    I may here explain that the country Uzinza was once a large kingdom,  governed by a king named Ruma, of Wahuma blood. At his death, which took  place in Dagara's time (the present Rumanika's father), the kingdom  was contested by his two sons, Rohinda and Suwarora, but, at the  intercession of Dagara, was divided--Rohinda taking the eastern, called  Ukhanga, and Suwarora the western half of the country, called Usui. This  measure made Usui feudatory to Karague, so that much of the produce of  the extortions committed in Usui went to Karague, and therefore they  were recognised, though the odium always rested on Suwarora, \"the savage  extortioner,\" rather than on the mild-disposed king of Karague, who kept  up the most amicable relations with every one who visited him.    Musa, I must say, was most loud in his praises of Rumanika; and on the  other hand, as Musa, eight years ago, had saved Rumanika's throne  for him against an insurrection got up by his younger brother  Rogero, Rumanika, always regarding Musa as his saviour, never lost an  opportunity to show his gratitude,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3287"],[0,"The Man from Glengarry: A Tale of the Ottawa (#20)"],[1," to bed.    \"Oh, auntie,\" she whispered, as her aunt kissed her good night, \"I  cannot go to sleep!\" And then, after a pause, she said, shyly, \"Do you  think he is badly hurt?\"    Then the minister's wife, looking keenly into the girl's face, made  light of Ranald's misfortune.    \"Oh, he will be all right,\" she said, \"as far as his hurt is concerned.  That is the least part of his trouble. You need not worry about that.  Good night, my dear.\" And Maimie, relieved by her aunt's tone, said  \"good night\" with her heart at rest.    Then Mrs. Murray went into the study, determined to find out what had  passed between her husband and Ranald. She found him lying on his couch,  luxuriating in the satisfaction of a good day's work behind him, and  his first pipe nearly done. She at once ventured upon the thing that lay  heavy upon her heart. She began by telling all she knew of the trouble  from its beginning in the church, and then waited for her husband's  story.    For some moments he lay silently smoking.    \"Ah, well,\" he said, at length, knocking out his pipe, \"perhaps I was a  little severe with the lad. He may not have been so much to blame.\"    \"Oh, papa! What did you do?\" said his wife, in an anxious voice.    \"Well,\" said the minister, hesitating, \"I found that the young  rascal had struck Aleck McRae first, and a very bad blow it was. So I  administered a pretty severe rebuke and sent him home.\"    \"Oh, what a shame!\" cried his wife, in indignant tears. \"It was far more  the fault of Peter and Aleck and the rest. Poor Ranald!\"    \"Now, my dear,\" said the minister, \"you need not fear for Ranald. I do  not suppose he cares much. Besides, his face was not fit to be seen, so  I sent him home. Well, it--\"    \"Yes,\" burst in his wife, \"great, brutal fellow, to strike a boy like  that!\"    \"Boy?\" said her husband. \"Well, he may be, but not many men would  dare to face him.\" Then he added, \"I wish I had known--I fear I  spoke--perhaps the boy may feel unjustly treated. He is as proud as  Lucifer.\"    \"Oh, papa!\" said his wife, \"what did you say?\"    \"Nothing but what was true. I just told him that a boy who would break  the Lord's Day by fighting, and in the very shadow of the Lord's house,  when Christian people were worshiping God, was acting like a savage, and  was not fit for the company of decent folk.\"    To this his wife made no reply, but went out of the study, leaving the  minister feeling very uncomfortable indeed. But by the end of the second  pipe he began to feel that, after all, Ranald had got no more than  was good for him, and that he would be none the worse of it; in which  comforting conviction he went to rest, and soon fell into the sleep  which is supposed to be the right of the just.    Not so his wife. Wearied though she was with the long day, its  excitements and its toils, sleep would not come. Anxious thoughts about  the lad she had come to love as if he were her own son or brother kept  crowding in upon her. The vision of his fierce, dark, stormy face held  her eyes awake and at length drew her from her bed. She went into the  study and fell upon her knees. The burden had grown too heavy for her to  bear alone. She would share it with Him who knew what it meant to bear  the sorrows and the sins of others.    As she rose, she heard Fido bark and whine in the yard below, and going  to the window, she saw a man standing at the back door, and Fido fawning  upon him. Startled, she was about to waken her husband, when the man  turned his face so that the moonlight fell upon it, and she saw Ranald.  Hastily she threw on her dressing-gown, put on her warm bedroom slippers  and cloak, ran down to the door, and in another moment was standing  before him, holding him by the shoulders.    \"Ranald!\" she cried, breathlessly, \"what is it?\"    \"I am going away,\" he said, simply. \"And I was just passing by--and--\"  he could not go on.    \"Oh, Ranald!\" she cried, \"I am glad you came this way. Now tell me  where you are going.\"    The boy looked at her as if she had started a new idea in his mind, and  then said, \"I do not know.\"    \"And what are you going to do, Ranald?\"    \"Work. There is plenty to do. No fear of that.\"    \"But your father, Ranald?\"    The boy was silent for a little, and then said, \"He will soon be well,  and he will not be needing me, and he said I could go.\" His voice broke  with the remembrance of the parting with his father.    \"And why are you going, Ranald?\" she said, looking into his eyes.    Again the boy stood silent.    \"Why do you go away from your home and your father, and--and--all of us  who love you?\"    \"Indeed, there is no one,\" he replied, bitterly; \"and I am not for  decent people. I am not for decent people. I know that well enough.  There is no one that will care much.\"    \"No one, Ranald?\" she asked, sadly. \"I thought--\" she paused, looking  steadily into his face.    Suddenly the boy turned to her, and putting out both his hands, burst  forth, his voice coming in dry sobs: \"Oh, yes, yes! I do believe you.  I do believe you. And that is why I came this way. I wanted to see your  door again before I went. Oh, I will never forget you! Never, never, and  I am glad I am seeing you, for now you will know--how much--\" The boy  was unable to proceed. His sobs were shaking his whole frame, and to his  shy Highland Scotch nature, words of love and admiration were not easy.  \"You will not be sending me back home again?\" he pleaded, anticipating  her. \"Indeed, I cannot stay in this place after to-day.\"    But the minister's wife kept her eyes steadily upon his face without a  word, trying in vain to find her voice, and the right words to say. She  had no need of words, for in her face, pale, wet with her flowing tears,  and illumined with her gray-brown eyes, Ranald read her heart.    \"Oh!\" he cried again, \"you are wanting me to stay, and I will be ashamed  before them all, and the minister, too. I cannot stay. I cannot stay.\"    \"And I cannot let you go, Ranald, my boy,\" she said, commanding her  voice to speech. \"I want you to be a brave man. I don't want you to be  afraid of them.\"    \"Afraid of them!\" said the boy, in scornful surprise. \"Not if they were  twice as more and twice as beeg.\"    Mrs. Murray saw her advantage, and followed it up.    \"And the minister did not know the whole truth, Ranald, and he was sorry  he spoke to you as he did.\"    \"Did he say that?\" said Ranald, in surprise. It was to him, as to any  one in that community, a terrible thing to fall under the displeasure of  the minister and to be disgraced in his eyes.    \"Yes, indeed, Ranald, and he would be sorry if you should go away. I am  sure he would blame himself.\"    This was quite a new idea to the boy. That the minister should think  himself to be in the wrong was hardly credible.    \"And how glad we would be,\" she continued, earnestly, \"to see you prove  yourself a man before them all.\"    Ranald shook his head. \"I would rather go away.\"    \"Perhaps, but it's braver to stay, and to do your work like a man.\" And  then, allowing him no time for words, she pictured to him the selfish,  cowardly part the man plays who marches bravely enough in the front  ranks until the battle begins, but who shrinks back and seeks an easy  place when the fight comes on, till his face fell before her in shame.  And then she showed him what she would like him to do, and what she  would like him to be in patience and in courage, till he stood once more  erect and steady.    \"Now, Ranald,\" she said, noting the effect of her words upon him, \"what  is it to be?\"    \"I will go back,\" he said, simply; and turning with a single word of  farewell, he sprang over the fence and disappeared in the woods. The  minister's wife stood looking the way he went long after he had passed  out of sight, and then, lifting her eyes to the radiant sky with its  shining lights, \"He made the stars also,\" she whispered, and went up to  her bed and laid her down and slept in peace. Her Sabbath day's work was  done.        CHAPTER X    THE HOME-COMING OF THE SHANTYMEN      For some weeks Ranald was not seen by any one belonging to the manse.  Hughie reported that he was not at church, nor at Bible class, and  although this was not in itself an extraordinary thing, still  Mrs. Murray was uneasy, and Hughie felt that church was a great  disappointment when Ranald was not there.    In their visits to Macdonald Dubh the minister and his wife never  could see Ranald. His Aunt Kirsty could not understand or explain his  reluctance to attend the public services, nor his unwillingness to  appear in the house on the occasion of the minister's visits. \"He is  busy with the fences and about the stables preparing for the spring's  work,\" she said; \"but, indeed, he is very queer whatever, and I cannot  make him out at all.\" Macdonald Dubh himself said nothing. But the books  and magazines brought by the minister's wife were always read. \"Indeed,  when once he gets down to his book,\" his aunt complained, \"neither his  bed nor his dinner will move him.\"    The minister thought little of the boy's \"vagaries,\" but to his wife  came many an anxious thought about Ranald and his doings. She was more  disappointed than she cared to confess, even to herself, that the boy  seemed to be quite indifferent to the steadily deepening interest in  spiritual things that marked the members of her Bible class.    While she was planning how to reach him once more, an event occurred  which brought him nearer to her than he had ever been before. As they  were sitting one evening at tea, the door unexpectedly opened, and  without announcement, in walked Ranald, splashed with hard riding, pale,  and dazed. Without a word of reply to the greetings that met him from  all at the table, he went straight to the minister's wife, handed her  an opened letter, and stood waiting. It was addressed to Ranald himself,  and was the first he had ever received in his life. It was from"]]]
