If our astonishment was great before, it was now beyond bounds.  The  identical buttonwood with its great parasite was before us, the dog  barking at its foot!  The third 'coon had taken shelter in its capacious  cavity.    \"`Wagh! massa!' ejaculated Abe, in a voice of terror, `its de same  varmint.  It ain't no 'coon, it's de debil!  For de lub o' God, massa,  let's get away from here!'    \"Of course I followed his advice, as to get at the 'coons was out of the  question.    \"We returned once more to the corn-field, but we found that we had at  last cleared it of 'coons.  It was still early, however, and I was  determined not to give up the hunt until I had assisted in killing a  'coon.  By Abe's advice, therefore, we struck into the woods with the  intention of making a circuit where the trees were small.  Some 'coon  might be prowling there in search of birds' nests.  So thought Abe.    \"He was right in his conjecture.  A fourth was started, and off went  Pompo after him.  In a few minutes the quick constant bark echoed back.  This time we were sure, from the direction, in a new tree.    \"It proved to be so, and such a small one that, on coming up, we saw the  animal squatted upon the branches, not twenty feet from the ground.    \"We were now sure of him, as we thought; and I had raised my gun to  fire; when all at once, as if guessing my intent, the 'coon sprang into  another tree, and then ran down to the ground and off again, with Pompo  veiling in his track.    \"Of course we expected that the dog would speedily tree him again, which  after a few minutes he did, but this time in the heavy timber.    \"We hastened forward, guided by the barking.  To the extreme of my  astonishment, and I fancy to the very extreme of Abe's terror, we again  found ourselves at the foot of the buttonwood.    \"Abe's wool stood on end.  Superstition was the butt-end of his  religion; and he not only protested, but I am satisfied that he  believed, that all the four 'coons were one and the same individual, and  that individual `de debil.'    \"Great 'coon-hunter as he was, he would now have gone home, if I had let  him.  But I had no thoughts of giving up the matter in that easy way.  I  was roused by the repeated disappointment.  A new resolve had entered my  mind.  I was determined to get the 'coons out of the buttonwood, cost  what it might.  The tree must come down, if it should take us till  morning to fell it.    \"With this determination I caught hold of Abe's axe, and struck the  first blow.  To my surprise and delight the tree sounded hollow.  I  repeated the stroke.  The sharp axe went crashing inwards.  The tree was  hollow to the ground; on the side where I had commenced chopping, it was  but a shell.    \"A few more blows, and I had made a hole large enough to put a head  through.  Felling such a tree would be no great job after all, and I saw  that it would hardly occupy an hour.  The tree must come down.    \"Abe seeing me so resolute, had somewhat recovered his courage and his  senses, and now laid hold of the axe.  Abe was a `first hand' at  `chopping,' and the hole soon gaped wider.    \"`If de hole run clar up, massa,' said he, resting for a moment, `we can  smoke out de varmint--wid de punk and de grass here we can smoke out de  debil himself.  S'pose we try 'im, massa?'    \"`Good!' cried I, catching at Abe's suggestion; and in a few minutes we  had made a fire in the hole, and covered it with leaves, grass, and  weeds.    \"The smoke soon did its work.  We saw it ooze out above at the entrance  of the 'coon hole--at first in a slight filmy stream, and then in thick  volumes.  We heard a scraping and rattling within the hollow trunk, and  a moment after a dark object sprang out upon the lliana, and ran a short  way downward.  Another followed, and another, and another, until a  string of no less than six raccoons squatted along the parasite  threatening to run downward!    \"The scene that followed was indescribable.  I had seized my gun, and  both barrels were emptied in a `squirrel's jump.'  Two of the 'coons  came to the ground, badly wounded.  Pompo tackled another, that had run  down the lliana, and was attempting to get off; while Abe with his axe  clove the skull of a fourth, that had tried to escape in a similar  manner.    \"The other two ran back into the `funnel,' but only to come out again  just in time to receive a shot each from the reloaded gun, which brought  both of them tumbling from the tree.  We succeeded in bagging the whole  family; and thus finished what Abe declared to be the greatest  `'coon-chase on de record.'    \"As it was by this time far in the night, we gathered up our game, and  took the `back track to hum.'\"        CHAPTER FOURTEEN.    WILD HOGS OF THE WOODS.    Next day while threading our way through a patch of oak forest--the  ground covered thickly with fallen leaves--we were startled by a  peculiar noise in front of us.  It was a kind of bellows-like snort,  exactly like that made by the domestic swine when suddenly affrighted.    Some of the party cried out \"bear,\" and of course this announcement  threw us all into a high state of excitement.  Even the buffalo itself  would be but secondary game, when a bear was upon the ground.    The \"snuff\" of the bear has a very considerable resemblance to that of  terrified hogs, and even our guides were deceived.  They thought it  might be \"bar\" we had heard.    It proved we were all wrong.  No wonder we fancied the noise resembled  that made by hogs.  The animal that uttered it was nothing else than a  wild boar.    \"What!\" you will exclaim, \"a wild boar in the forests of Missouri?  Oh!  a peccary I suppose.\"    No, not a peccary; for these creatures do not range so far north as the  latitude of Missouri--not a wild boar, neither, if you restrict the  meaning of the phrase to the true indigenous animal of that kind.  For  all that, it was a wild boar, or rather a boar _ran wild_.  Wild enough  and savage too it appeared, although we had only a glimpse of its shaggy  form as it dashed into the thicket with a loud grunt.  Half a dozen  shots followed it.  No doubt it was tickled with some of the \"leaden  hail\" from the double-barrelled guns, but it contrived to escape,  leaving us only the incident as a subject for conversation.    Throughout the backwoods there are large numbers of half-wild hogs, but  they are usually the denizens of woods that are inclosed by a  rail-fence, and therefore private property.  One part of the year they  are tamer, when a scarcity of food renders it necessary for them to  approach the owner's house, and eat the corn placed for them in a  well-known spot.  At this season they answer to a call somewhat similar  to the \"milk oh!\" of the London dairyman, but loud enough to be heard a  mile or more through the woods.  A traveller passing through the  backwoods' settlements will often hear this singular call sounding afar  off in the stillness of the evening.    These hogs pick up most of their subsistence in the forest.  The \"mast\"  of the beech-tree, the nut of the hickory, the fruit of the Chinquapin  oak, the acorn, and many other seeds and berries, furnish them with  food.  Many roots besides, and grasses, contribute to sustain them, and  they make an occasional meal off a snake whenever they can get hold of  one.  Indeed it may be safely asserted, that no other cause has  contributed so much to the destruction of these reptiles, as the  introduction of the domestic hog into the forests of America.  Wherever  a tract of woods has been used as the \"run\" of a drove of hogs, serpents  of every kind become exceedingly scarce, and you may hunt through such a  tract for weeks without seeing one.  The hog seems to have the strongest  antipathy to the snake tribe; without the least fear of them.  When one  of the latter is discovered by a hog, and no crevice in the rocks, or  hollow log, offers it a shelter, its destruction is inevitable.  The hog  rushes to the spot, and, bounding forward, crushes the reptile under his  hoof's.  Should the first attempt not succeed, and the serpent glide  away, the hog nimbly follows, and repeats his efforts until the victim  lies helpless.  The victor then goes to work with his powerful jaws, and  quietly devours the prey.    The fondness of the hog for this species of food proves that in a state  of nature it is partially a carnivorous animal.  The peccary, which is  the true representative of the wild hog in America--has the very same  habit, and is well-known to be one of the most fatal enemies of the  serpent tribe to be found among American animals.    The hog shows no fear of the snake.  His thick hide seems to protect  him.  The \"skin\" of the rattle-snake or the \"hiss\" of the deadly  \"moccasin,\" are alike unheeded by him.  He kills them as easily as he  does the innocent \"chicken snake\" or the black constrictor.  The latter  often escapes from its dreaded enemy by taking to a bush or tree; but  the rattle-snake and the moccasin are not tree-climbers, and either hide  themselves in the herbage and dead leaves, or retreat to their holes.    It is not true that the hog cats the body of the snake he has killed,  leaving the head untouched, and thus avoiding the poisoned fangs.  He  devours the whole of the creature, head and all.  The venom of the  snake, like the \"curari\" poison of the South-American Indians, is only  effective when coming in contact with the blood.  Taken internally its  effects are innoxious--indeed there are those who believe it to be  beneficial, and the curari is often swallowed as a medicine.    Most of this information about the half-wild hogs of the backwoods was  given by our Kentucky comrade,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23519"],[0,"The Mormon Menace: The Confessions of John Doyle Lee, Danite (#20)"],[1,"us in our  duty and gave the long-faced hypocrites such a lecture that much  good was done. I had at that time learned to dread a religious  fanatic, and I was pleased to hear the Prophet lay down the law  to them. A fanatic is always dangerous, but a religious fanatic  is to be dreaded by all men - there is no reason in one of them.  I cannot understand how men will blindly follow fanatical  teachers. I always demanded a reason for my belief, and hoped I  never would become a victim of fanaticism.    During the summer of 1840 I built a house and such other  buildings as I required on my lot on Warsaw street, and was again  able to say I had a home. The brethren were formed into military  companies that year in Nauvoo. Col. A. P. Rockwood was drillmaster.  Brother Rockwood was then a captain, but was afterwards promoted  to be colonel of the Host of Israel. I was then fourth corporal  of the company. The people were regularly drilled and taught  military tactics, so that they would be ready to act when the  time came for returning to Jackson County, the land of our  inheritance. Most of my wife's relatives came to Nauvoo that  year, and settled near my house.    In 1841 I was sent on a mission through Illinois, Kentucky, and  Tennessee. I also visited portions of Arkansas. I traveled in  company, on that mission, with Elder Franklin Edwards. I was then  timid about speaking in towns or cities. I felt that I had not a  sufficient experience to justify me in doing so.    My comrade had less experience than I had, and the worst of it  was he would not study to improve his mind, or permit me to study  in quiet. He was negligent, and did not pay sufficient attention  to secret prayer, to obtain that nearness to God that is so  necessary for a minister to have if he expects his works to be  blessed with Divine favor. I told him he must do better, or go  home. He promised to do better; also agreed that he would do the  begging for food and lodging, and I might do the preaching. I  accepted the offer, and in this way we got along well and  pleasantly for some time.    At the crossing of the Forkadeer River we stayed over night with  the ferryman, and were well entertained. When we left the ferry  the old gentleman told us we would be in a settlement of  Methodist people that evening, and they were set in their notions  and hated Mormons as badly as the Church of England hated  Methodists, and if we got food or shelter among them he would be  mistaken. He told us to begin to ask for lodging at least an hour  before sundown, or we would not get it.    In the after-part of the day we remembered the advice of the  morning and stopped at every house. The houses were about half a  mile apart. We were refused at every house. The night came on  dark and stormy, the rain fell in torrents, while heavy peals of  thunder and bright flashes of lightning were constant, or seemed  so to me. The timber was very heavy, making the night darker than  it would otherwise have been. The road was badly cut up from  heavy freight teams passing over it, and the holes were full of  water. We fell into many holes of mud and water, and were well  soaked.    About ten o'clock we called at the house of a Methodist class  leader, and asked for lodging and food. He asked who we were. We  told him that we were Mormon preachers. As soon as he heard the  name Mormon he became enraged, and said no Mormon could stay in  his house. We started on. Soon afterwards we heard him making  efforts to set his dogs on us. The dogs came running and barking,  as a pack of hounds always do.    Brother Edwards was much frightened; but I told him not to be  scared, I would protect him. So when the dogs came near us I  commenced to clap my hands and shouted as though the fox was just  ahead of us; this caused the dogs to rush on and leave us in  safety. In this way we escaped injury from the pack of ten or  more dogs that the Methodist had put on our trail.    At the next house we were again refused shelter and food. I asked  for permission to sit under the porch until the rain stopped.    \"No,\" said the man, \"if you were not Mormons I would gladly  entertain you, but as you are Mormons I dare not permit you to  stop around me.\"    This made twenty-one houses that we had called at and asked for  lodging, and at each place we had been refused, simply because we  were Mormons.    About midnight my partner grew very sick of his contract to do  the begging and resolved to die before he would ask for aid from  such people again. I told him I would have both food and lodging  at the next place we stopped. He said it was useless to make the  attempt, and I confess that the numerous refusals we had met with  were calculated to dishearten many a person; but I had faith in  God. I had never yet gone to Him in a humble and penitent manner  without receiving strength to support me, nor had He ever sent me  empty-handed from Him. My trust was in God, and I advanced to the  next house, confident that I would not ask in vain.    As we approached the house we discovered that the negroes were  having a dance. I asked where their master was; they pointed out  the house to me. We walked to the house and up on the porch. The  door was standing open; a candle was burning, and near the fire a  woman was sitting holding a sick child on her lap. The man was  also sitting near the fire. Our footsteps attracted their  attention; our appearance was not inviting as we stood there wet,  muddy, and tired. I spoke in a loud voice, saying:    \"Sir, I beseech you, in the name of Jesus Christ, to entertain us  as servants of the living God. We are ministers of the gospel, we  travel without purse or scrip; we preach without hire, and are  now without money; we are wet, weary, and hungry; we want  refreshment, rest, and shelter.\"    The man sprang to his feet, but did not say a word. His wife  said:    \"Tell them to come in.\"    \"We will do you no harm; we are friends, not enemies,\" I said.    We were invited in. Servants were called, a good fire was made  and a warm supper placed before us. After eating we were shown to  a good bed. We slept until near ten o'clock in the morning. When  we did awaken our clothes were clean and dry, and breakfast was  ready and waiting for us. In fact, we were as well treated as it  was possible to ask.    This family had lately come from the State of Virginia, intending  to try that climate for a year, and then, if they liked it,  purchase land and stay there permanently. After breakfast the  gentleman said:    \"You had a severe time of it among the Christians yesterday and  last night. As you are ministers, sent out to convert sinners,  you cannot do better than to preach to these Christians, and seek  to convert them.\"    He offered to send word all over the settlement and notify the  people, if we would stay and preach that night. We accepted his  offer, and remained, thus securing the rest that we so much  needed, thanking God for still remembering and caring for us, His  servants.    Agreeably to arrangements, we preached in the Methodist meeting-  house to a very attentive audience upon the first principles of  the gospel. We alluded to the treatment of Christ and His  followers by the Pharisees and Sadducees, the religious sects of  those days, and said that we preached the same gospel, and fared  but little better. This meeting-house had been built conjointly  by Methodists and Universalists. Members from both persuasions  were present. Our neighbor who had fed and cared for us leaned to  the latter faith.    At the close of our remarks the class leader who had set the  hounds on our track was the first to the stand to invite us home  with him. I told him that the claims of those who did not set  their dogs on us, after they had turned us from their doors  hungry, were first with me - that his claims were an after  consideration. He said it was his negro boys that sent the hounds  after us; he would not be bluffed. He said that one of us must go  with him - that if I would not go Brother Frank must go. I told  him that Elder Edwards could use his own pleasure, but I would  hold a meeting that night with our Universalist brethren; and  thus we parted.    Elder Edwards went to spend the night with the class leader,  while I attended a meeting with the friends who had invited me  home with them. I had a good time. Of their own accord they made  up a collection of a few dollars as a token of their regard for  me. I was to meet Elder Edwards at the house of my friend who  took us in at midnight from the storm, an hour before sun; but he  did not put in an appearance for an hour after. When he got  within talking distance I saw by his features that he had been  roughly dealt with. His first words were:    \"He is the wickedest old man that I ever met with, and, if he  don't repent, God will curse him.\"    That was enough, and I began to laugh. I conceived what he had to  encounter the long night before. He said:    \"If the Lord will forgive me for going this time, I will never go  again unless you are along.\" I said to him:    \"Brother Frank, experience teaches a dear school, yet fools will  not learn at any other. I knew what treatment you would receive,  and refused to go. If you had been a wise man you would have  taken the hint and kept away from him.\"    We made our way through to Overton County, Tennessee. Here I  advised my friend Edwards to return to Nauvoo, and gave him money  to pay his fare on a steamer, for he was not cut out for a  preacher.    At Carlisle, the county seat of Overton County, I met with a  young man, an elder, by the name of Dwight Webster. Though but  little experienced, yet he was a man of steady habits and an  agreeable companion. We held a number of meetings in this part of  the country. Brother Webster and I baptized several persons, and  made a true friend of a wealthy merchant, named Armstrong, who  welcomed us to his"]]]
