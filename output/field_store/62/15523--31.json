[91] A writer at the beginning of the seventeenth century    (Cotta, _Tryall of Witchcraft_) says, 'This kind is not    obscure at this day, swarming in this kingdom, whereof no    man can be ignorant who lusteth to observe the uncontrouled    liberty and licence of open and ordinary resort in all    places unto _wise_ men and _wise_ women, so vulgarly termed    for their reputed knowledge concerning such diseased persons    as are supposed to be bewitched.' And (_Short Discoverie of    Unobserved Dangers, 1612_) 'the mention of witchecraft doth    now occasion the remembrance in the next place of a sort of    practitioners whom our custom and country doth call wise men    and wise women, reputed a kind of good and honest harmless    witches or wizards, who, by good words, by hallowed herbs    and salves, and other superstitious ceremonies, promise to    allay and calm devils, practices of other witches, and the    forces of many diseases.' Another writer of the same date    considers 'it were a thousand times better for the land if    all witches, but specially the _blessing witch_, might    suffer death. Men do commonly hate and spit at the    _damnifying_ sorcerer as unworthy to live among them,    whereas they fly unto the other in necessity; they depend    upon him as their God, and by this means thousands are    carried away, to their final confusion. Death, therefore, is    the just and deserved portion of the _good_    witch.'--_Observations on the Popular Antiquities of Great    Britain_, by Brand, ed. by Sir H. Ellis.    Equally various and contradictory are the motives and acts  assigned to witches. Nothing is too great or too mean for their  practice: they engage with equal pleasure in the overthrow of a  kingdom or a religion, and in inflicting the most ordinary evils  and mischiefs in life. Their mode of bewitching is various: by  fascination or casting an evil eye ('Nescio,' says the Virgilian  shepherd, 'quis teneros oculus mihi fascinat agnos'); by making  representations of the person to be acted upon in wax or clay,  roasting them before a fire; by mixing magical ointments or  other compositions and ingredients revealed to us in the  witch-songs of Shakspeare, Jonson, Middleton, Shadwell, and  others; sometimes merely by muttering an imprecation.    They ride in sieves on the sea, on brooms, spits magically  prepared; and by these modes of conveyance are borne, without  trouble or loss of time, to their destination. By these means  they attend the periodical sabbaths, the great meetings of the  witch-tribe, where they assemble at stated times to do homage, to  recount their services, and to receive the commands of their  lord. They are held on the night between Friday and Saturday; and  every year a grand sabbath is ordered for celebration on the  Blocksberg mountains, for the night before the first day of May.  In those famous mountains the obedient vassals congregate from  all parts of Christendom--from Italy, Spain, Germany, France,  England, and Scotland. A place where four roads meet, a rugged  mountain range, or perhaps the neighbourhood of a secluded lake  or some dark forest, is usually the spot selected for the  meeting.[92]      [92] 'When orders had once been issued for the meeting of    the sabbath, all the wizards and witches who failed to    attend it were lashed by demons with a rod made of serpents    or scorpions. In France and England the witches were    supposed to ride uniformly upon broom-sticks; but in Italy    and Spain, the devil himself, in the shape of a goat, used    to transport them on his back, which lengthened or shortened    according to the number of witches he was desirous of    accommodating. No witch, when proceeding to the sabbath,    could get out by a door or window were she to try ever so    much. Their general mode of ingress was by the key-hole, and    of egress by the chimney, up which they flew, broom and all,    with the greatest ease. To prevent the absence of the    witches being noticed by their neighbours, some inferior    demon was commanded to assume their shapes, and lie in their    beds, feigning illness, until the sabbath was over. When all    the wizards and witches had arrived at the place of    rendezvous, the infernal ceremonies began. Satan having    assumed his favourite shape of a large he-goat, with a face    in front and another in his haunches, took his seat upon a    throne; and all present in succession paid their respects to    him and kissed him in his face behind. This done, he    appointed a master of the ceremonies, in company with whom    he made a personal examination of all the witches, to see    whether they had the secret mark about them by which they    were stamped as the devil's own. This mark was always    insensible to pain. Those who had not yet been marked    received the mark from the master of the ceremonies, the    devil at the same time bestowing nick-names upon them. This    done, they all began to sing and dance in the most furious    manner until some one arrived who was anxious to be admitted    into their society. They were then silent for a while until    the new comer had denied his salvation, kissed the devil,    spat upon the Bible, and sworn obedience to him in all    things. They then began dancing again with all their might    and singing.... In the course of an hour or two they    generally became wearied of this violent exercise, and then    they all sat down and recounted their evil deeds since last    meeting. Those who had not been malicious and mischievous    enough towards their fellow-creatures received personal    chastisement from Satan himself, who flogged them with    thorns or scorpions until they were covered with blood and    unable to sit or stand. When this ceremony was concluded,    they were all amused by a dance of toads. Thousands of these    creatures sprang out of the earth, and standing on their    hind-legs, danced while the devil played the bagpipes or the    trumpet. These toads were all endowed with the faculty of    speech, and entreated the witches there to reward them with    the flesh of unbaptized infants for their exertions to give    them pleasure. The witches promised compliance. The devil    bade them remember to keep their word; and then stamping his    foot, caused all the toads to sink into the earth in an    instant. The place being thus cleared, preparations were    made for the banquet, where all manner of disgusting things    were served up and greedily devoured by the demons and    witches, although the latter were sometimes regaled with    choice meats and expensive wines, from golden plates and    crystal goblets; but they were never thus favoured unless    they had done an extraordinary number of evil deeds since    the last period of meeting. After the feast, they began    dancing again; but such as had no relish for any more    exercise in that way, amused themselves by mocking the holy    sacrament of baptism. For this purpose the toads were again    called up, and sprinkled with filthy water, the devil making    the sign of the cross, and all the witches calling    out--[some gibberish]. When the devil wished to be    particularly amused, he made the witches strip off their    clothes and dance before him, each with a cat tied round her    neck, and another dangling from her body in form of a tail.    When the cock crew they all disappeared, and the sabbath was    ended. This is a summary of the belief that prevailed for    many centuries nearly all over Europe, and which is far from    eradicated even at this day.'--_Memoirs of Extraordinary    Popular Delusions_, by C. Mackay.    A mock sermon often concludes the night's proceedings, the  ordinary salutation of the _osculum in tergo_ being first given.  But these circumstances are innocent compared with the obscene  practices when the lights are put out; indiscriminate debauchery  being then the order of the night. A new rite of baptism  initiated the neophyte into his new service: the candidate being  signed with the sign of the devil on that part of the body least  observable, and submitting at the same time to the first act of  criminal compliance, to be often repeated. On these occasions the  demon presents himself in the form of either sex, according to  that of his slaves. It was elicited from a witch examined at a  trial that, from the period of her servitude, the devil had had  intercourse with her _ut viri cum f[oe]minis solent_, excepting  only in one remarkable particular.    During the pontificate of Julius II.--the first decade of the  sixteenth century--a set of sorceresses was discovered in large  numbers: a dispute between the civil and ecclesiastical  authorities averted their otherwise certain destruction. The  successors of Innocent VIII. repeated his anathemas. Alexander  VI., Leo X., and Adrian VI. appointed special commissioners for  hunting up sorcerers and heretics. In 1523, Adrian issued a bull  against _Haeresis Strigiatus_ with power to excommunicate all who  opposed those engaged in the inquisition. He characterises the  obnoxious class as a sect deviating from the Catholic faith,  denying their baptism, showing contempt for the sacraments, in  particular for that of the Eucharist, treading crosses under  foot, and taking the devil as their lord.[93] How many suffered  for the crime during the thirty or forty years following upon the  bull of 1484, it is difficult exactly to ascertain: that some  thousands perished is certain, on the testimony of the judges  themselves. The often-quoted words of Florimond, author of a work  'On Antichrist,' as given by Del Rio the Jesuit ('De Magia'), are  not hyperbolical. 'All those,' says he, 'who have afforded us  some signs of the approach of antichrist agree that the increase  of sorcery and witchcraft is to distinguish the melancholy period  of his advent; and was ever age so"]]]
