For  no other cause, I deem, didst Thou, our God, suffer it, but that he who  was hereafter to prove so great a man, should already begin to learn  that in judging of causes, man was not readily to be condemned by man  out of a rash credulity. For as he was walking up and down by himself  before the judgment-seat, with his note-book and pen, lo, a young man, a  lawyer, the real thief, privily bringing a hatchet, got in, unperceived  by Alypius, as far as the leaden gratings which fence in the  silversmiths' shops, and began to cut away the lead. But the noise of  the hatchet being heard, the silversmiths beneath began to make a stir,  and sent to apprehend whomever they should find. But he, hearing their  voices, ran away, leaving his hatchet, fearing to be taken with it.  Alypius now, who had not seen him enter, was aware of his going, and  saw with what speed he made away. And being desirous to know the matter,  entered the place; where finding the hatchet, he was standing, wondering  and considering it, when behold, those that had been sent, find him  alone with the hatchet in his hand, the noise whereof had startled and  brought them thither. They seize him, hale him away, and gathering the  dwellers in the market-place together, boast of having taken a notorious  thief, and so he was being led away to be taken before the judge.    But thus far was Alypius to be instructed. For forthwith, O Lord, Thou  succouredst his innocency, whereof Thou alone wert witness. For as he  was being led either to prison or to punishment, a certain architect met  them, who had the chief charge of the public buildings. Glad they  were to meet him especially, by whom they were wont to be suspected of  stealing the goods lost out of the marketplace, as though to show him at  last by whom these thefts were committed. He, however, had divers times  seen Alypius at a certain senator's house, to whom he often went to pay  his respects; and recognising him immediately, took him aside by the  hand, and enquiring the occasion of so great a calamity, heard the whole  matter, and bade all present, amid much uproar and threats, to go with  him. So they came to the house of the young man who had done the  deed. There, before the door, was a boy so young as to be likely, not  apprehending any harm to his master, to disclose the whole. For he  had attended his master to the market-place. Whom so soon as Alypius  remembered, he told the architect: and he showing the hatchet to the  boy, asked him \"Whose that was?\" \"Ours,\" quoth he presently: and being  further questioned, he discovered every thing. Thus the crime being  transferred to that house, and the multitude ashamed, which had begun  to insult over Alypius, he who was to be a dispenser of Thy Word, and an  examiner of many causes in Thy Church, went away better experienced and  instructed.    Him then I had found at Rome, and he clave to me by a most strong tie,  and went with me to Milan, both that he might not leave me, and might  practise something of the law he had studied, more to please his parents  than himself. There he had thrice sat as Assessor, with an uncorruptness  much wondered at by others, he wondering at others rather who could  prefer gold to honesty. His character was tried besides, not only with  the bait of covetousness, but with the goad of fear. At Rome he was  Assessor to the count of the Italian Treasury. There was at that time a  very powerful senator, to whose favours many stood indebted, many much  feared. He would needs, by his usual power, have a thing allowed him  which by the laws was unallowed. Alypius resisted it: a bribe was  promised; with all his heart he scorned it: threats were held out; he  trampled upon them: all wondering at so unwonted a spirit, which neither  desired the friendship, nor feared the enmity of one so great and so  mightily renowned for innumerable means of doing good or evil. And the  very judge, whose councillor Alypius was, although also unwilling  it should be, yet did not openly refuse, but put the matter off upon  Alypius, alleging that he would not allow him to do it: for in truth had  the judge done it, Alypius would have decided otherwise. With this one  thing in the way of learning was he well-nigh seduced, that he might  have books copied for him at Praetorian prices, but consulting justice,  he altered his deliberation for the better; esteeming equity whereby he  was hindered more gainful than the power whereby he were allowed. These  are slight things, but he that is faithful in little, is faithful also  in much. Nor can that any how be void, which proceeded out of the mouth  of Thy Truth: If ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous Mammon,  who will commit to your trust true riches? And if ye have not been  faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which  is your own? He being such, did at that time cleave to me, and with me  wavered in purpose, what course of life was to be taken.    Nebridius also, who having left his native country near Carthage, yea  and Carthage itself, where he had much lived, leaving his excellent  family-estate and house, and a mother behind, who was not to follow him,  had come to Milan, for no other reason but that with me he might live in  a most ardent search after truth and wisdom. Like me he sighed, like  me he wavered, an ardent searcher after true life, and a most acute  examiner of the most difficult questions. Thus were there the mouths  of three indigent persons, sighing out their wants one to another, and  waiting upon Thee that Thou mightest give them their meat in due season.  And in all the bitterness which by Thy mercy followed our worldly  affairs, as we looked towards the end, why we should suffer all this,  darkness met us; and we turned away groaning, and saying, How long shall  these things be? This too we often said; and so saying forsook them not,  for as yet there dawned nothing certain, which these forsaken, we might  embrace.    And I, viewing and reviewing things, most wondered at the length of time  from that my nineteenth year, wherein I had begun to kindle with the  desire of wisdom, settling when I had found her, to abandon all the  empty hopes and lying frenzies of vain desires. And lo, I was now in  my thirtieth year, sticking in the same mire, greedy of enjoying things  present, which passed away and wasted my soul; while I said to myself,  \"Tomorrow I shall find it; it will appear manifestly and I shall grasp  it; lo, Faustus the Manichee will come, and clear every thing! O you  great men, ye Academicians, it is true then, that no certainty can  be attained for the ordering of life! Nay, let us search the more  diligently, and despair not. Lo, things in the ecclesiastical books  are not absurd to us now, which sometimes seemed absurd, and may be  otherwise taken, and in a good sense. I will take my stand, where, as  a child, my parents placed me, until the clear truth be found out. But  where shall it be sought or when? Ambrose has no leisure; we have no  leisure to read; where shall we find even the books? Whence, or when  procure them? from whom borrow them? Let set times be appointed, and  certain hours be ordered for the health of our soul. Great hope has  dawned; the Catholic Faith teaches not what we thought, and vainly  accused it of; her instructed members hold it profane to believe God to  be bounded by the figure of a human body: and do we doubt to 'knock,'  that the rest 'may be opened'? The forenoons our scholars take up; what  do we during the rest? Why not this? But when then pay we court to our  great friends, whose favour we need? When compose what we may sell  to scholars? When refresh ourselves, unbending our minds from this  intenseness of care?    \"Perish every thing, dismiss we these empty vanities, and betake  ourselves to the one search for truth! Life is vain, death uncertain; if  it steals upon us on a sudden, in what state shall we depart hence?  and where shall we learn what here we have neglected? and shall we not  rather suffer the punishment of this negligence? What, if death itself  cut off and end all care and feeling? Then must this be ascertained.  But God forbid this! It is no vain and empty thing, that the excellent  dignity of the authority of the Christian Faith hath overspread the  whole world. Never would such and so great things be by God wrought for  us, if with the death of the body the life of the soul came to an end.  Wherefore delay then to abandon worldly hopes, and give ourselves wholly  to seek after God and the blessed life? But wait! Even those things are  pleasant; they have some, and no small sweetness. We must not lightly  abandon them, for it were a shame to return again to them. See, it is  no great matter now to obtain some station, and then what should we more  wish for? We have store of powerful friends; if nothing else offer, and  we be in much haste, at least a presidentship may be given us: and a  wife with some money, that she increase not our charges: and this shall  be the bound of desire. Many great men, and most worthy of imitation,  have given themselves to the study of wisdom in the state of marriage.\"    While I went over these things, and these winds shifted and drove my  heart this way and that, time passed on, but I delayed to turn to the  Lord; and from day to day deferred to live in Thee, and deferred not  daily to die in myself. Loving a happy life, I feared it in its own  abode, and sought it, by fleeing from it. I thought I should be too  miserable, unless folded in female arms; and of the medicine of Thy  mercy to cure that infirmity I thought not, not having tried it. As for  continency, I supposed it to be in our own power (though in myself I did  not find that power), being so foolish as not to know what is written,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32982"],[0,"Student's Hand-book of Mushrooms of America, Edible and Poisonous (#20)"],[1,"Roze.

BREFIELD'S CLASSIFICATION OF FUNGI.      A system of classification of fungi which is receiving attention from  mycologists is that recently presented by the distinguished German  author Dr. Oscar Brefield. Dr. Brefield's exhaustive investigations into  the life-history of fungi in general have been such as to entitle his  views to consideration, although the system presents some  inconsistencies which may prevent its adoption in its entirety.    According to the Brefield system, as summarized by his colleague Dr. Von  Tavel, Fungi are divided into two primary classes: (1) the  _Phycomycetes,_ or lower fungi nearest like the algae, _consisting of a  one-celled thallus with sexual as well as non-sexual modes of  reproduction_, and (2) the Mesomycetes and the Mycomycetes, _having a  divided or many celled thallus, propagated by non-sexually formed  spores_. The Phycomycetes are further divided into two large sections,  based on their methods of reproduction, termed, respectively,  Zygomycetes and Oomycetes. These include the old typical Mucors, the  Peronosporeae or \"rotting moulds,\" once classed with the Hyphomycetes,  the Saprolegniaceae, \"Fish Moulds,\" of aquatic habit, the  Entomophthoraceae, \"Insect Moulds,\" together with some minor groups. The  Mesomycetes connect the Phycomycetes with the Mycomycetes. The class  Mycomycetes is primarily divided into two sections, viz., Ascomycetes  and Basidiomycetes, with the Ustilagineae, \"Smut Fungi,\" in Mesomycetes,  forming a transitional group between Phycomycetes and the Basidiomycetal  group of the higher fungi.    The Ascomycetes are primarily subdivided into _Exoasci_ and _Carpoasci,_  groups based on the character of the asci. In the first, _Exoasci,_ the  asci are naked and borne directly on the mycelium; in the second,  _Carpoasci,_ they are enclosed in a wrapper composed of fertile hyphae  and sterile threads, having also accessory fruit forms. The first  includes Endomycetes and Taphrineae. In the second are included the  groups Gymnoasci, Perisporaceae, Pyrenomycetes, Hysteriaceae,  Discomycetes, and Helvellaceae.    The Basidiomycetes characterized by the possession of basidia are  arranged in two groups, based on the character of the basidia: (1) the  Protobasidiomycetes, in which the basidia are septate, divided, and (2)  the Autobasidiomycetes, in which the basidia are not divided, and bear a  definite number of spores.    The first of these (Protobasidiomycetes) includes the following distinct  groups: (1) the Uredineae, \"Rust Fungi,\" which have horizontally divided  basidia, always free, never enclosed; (2) the Auricularieae, having  basidia somewhat resembling those of the Uredineae, but which are borne  in fruit bodies with open hymenia; (3) Pileacreae, having horizontal  septate basidia in closed receptacles; and (4) Tremellineae, having  vertically divided basidia borne in gymnocarpous receptacles--that is,  those in which the hymenium is exposed while the spores are growing.    The Autobasidiomycetes are characterized by undivided basidia, bearing  spores only at the apex. This group is subdivided into three sections:  (1) Dacryomycetes, which includes the lowest of the Tremelloid forms,  with club-shaped basidia, nearly approaching the true Hymenomycetal  type, together with several groups of minor import; (2) Gasteromycetes;  and (3) Hymenomycetes, with Phalloideae placed in the group as a  subsection of Gasteromycetes.    The above can only be considered as a very brief abstract of the system  of classification proposed by Dr. Brefield, but it will serve to give  some idea of the principle on which the system is based, which is  sufficient for our present purpose. Those who wish to study the system  in detail will find it treated in a comprehensive manner in Dr. Von  Tavel's summary as it appears in the _Vergleichende Morphologie der  Pilze_, Jena, 1892.          CONIOMYCETES AND HYPHOMYCETES.      In the original classification of Fries two of the primary divisions of  the sporiferous Fungi were termed, respectively, _Coniomycetes_ and  _Hyphomycetes_. This arrangement was accepted by Berkeley, the term  _Coniomycetes_ being applied to all fungi in which the naked spores,  appearing like an impalpable dust, were the principal feature of the  plant, and the term _Hyphomycetes_ to fungi in which the threads or  hyphae bearing the spores were the most conspicuous feature.    Coniomycetes, as broadly interpreted by Berkeley and other mycologists  of his day, included the Uredineae or \"rust fungi,\" the Ustilagines or  \"smut fungi,\" the Sphaeropsideae, and the Melanconieae. This arrangement  was very unsatisfactory on account of the distinctively different  character of the methods of reproduction of the respective groups, and  they have since been disassociated and by some authors ranked as  distinct orders or families. Others combine Uredinei and Ustilaginei in  one group under the name Hypodermei.    Familiar examples of Uredinei are seen in the rust of the Barberry leaf,  etc., and of the Ustilaginei in the \"smut\" of corn and the \"bunt\" of  wheat.    Some authors combine the Sphaeropsideae with the closely allied  Melanconieae. M. C. Cooke contends that the _Sphaeropsideae_ should be  considered apart from the _Melanconieae,_ on the fundamental basis that  the former possess a distinct perithecium, while the latter do not.    The _Sphaeropsideae_ as recently defined by Cooke are \"Fungi _possessed of  a perithecium, but without asci_, ... sporules or stylospores being  produced internally at the apex of more or less distinct supporting  hyphae or pedicels, termed sporophores.\"    The Sphaeropsideae somewhat resemble the Pyrenomyceteae in external  characteristics, but differ from them in the absence of asci and  paraphyses. Saccardo retains all the species in his Sylloge, but  relegates them to an inferior position as imperfect fungi.    The group _Pyrenomycetes_, or _Sphaeriacei_, as at"]]]
