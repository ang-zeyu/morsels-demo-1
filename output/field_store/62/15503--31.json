When supper was over he sat back in his chair and lit a pipe. A  comfortable supper made him loquacious.    \"Well, Janet, you don't ask where I've been.\"    \"Was it to the circus, father?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"How did you like the show?\"    \"I didn't see it,\" he growled, a frown gathering upon his brow.    \"And why not, father?\"    \"Because we had a fight to get in free, and got the worst of it.\"    \"They must be main strong, then, those circus men.\"    \"Strong!\" repeated Hayden, scornfully. \"Well, mayhap they are, but we'd  have bested them but for the giant.\"    \"The giant! Is it the big man I saw in the parade?\"    \"Yes; he's as strong as three men. He flung me down as easily as I'd  throw a boy.\"    \"Then he must have been strong, for you're a powerful man, father.\"    \"There isn't a man as works in the mine'll compare with me, lass,\" said  Hayden, proudly; \"but all the same I'm no match for a monster.\"    \"Tell me about it, father,\" said Janet, with natural curiosity.    Dick Hayden went on to describe the fight around the ticket stand, and  how he had slipped away, intending to cut the ropes of the tent and let  it down on the heads of the spectators gathered inside.    \"I'd have done it, too,\" he added, \"but for a kid.\"    \"I thought just now you said it was the giant.\"    \"And I stick to it, lass; but this boy saw what I was doing, and brought  the giant to the spot. I could do nothing after that. He threw me down,  so that for a few minutes I was stunned.\"    \"And how did the fight come out at the ticket stand, father?\"    \"Our men had almost overpowered the circus men, when the giant rushed  into the midst, and, seizing a club from Bob Stubbs, laid about him,  till half a dozen of our strongest men lay on the ground with broken  heads.\"    What puzzled Janet was, that her father should have come home in such  good humor after so disastrous a defeat. It was contrary to her  experience of him. She would naturally have expected that he would be  surly and quarrelsome. The mystery was soon made clear.    \"But we've got even with them!\" chuckled Hayden directly after.    \"How is that, father?\"    \"We caught the kid.\"    \"You have?\"    \"Yes; he was goin' to the circus cars to turn in when Stubbs and I  caught him.\"    \"You--you didn't kill him, father?\" asked Janet in alarm.    \"No, not yet.\"    \"Where is he?\"    \"Do you mind the deserted cabin on Knob Hill?\"    \"Yes, father.\"    \"He's locked up in that, tied hand and foot.\"    \"How long do you mean to keep him there?\" asked Janet, anxiously.    \"Till to-morrow, and then----\" Dick paused ominously.    \"Well, and then?\"    \"He'll be lucky if he gets off with a whole skin,\" growled her father.  \"But for him I'd have brought down the tent about the ears of the people  that sat inside, and we'd have had a fine revenge on the showmen.\"    \"You don't mean to kill the boy, do you, father?\"    \"What is it to you, lass? You'd best mind your own business. You've got  nothing to do with it.\"    \"How does the boy look? Was it the one that drove the first chariot,  father?\"    \"Like enough, lass! Did you see him?\"    \"Yes; I saw the parade. Everybody was out in the streets then.\"    \"And you took partic'lar notice of the boy? That's like a lass,\"  chuckled Hayden.    \"But it was his duty, father, to stand by the show, seein' he belongs to  it.\"    \"I don't trouble myself about that. He brought that monster on me, and  I'm sore yet with the fall he gave me. I'll take it out of the kid.\"    \"But it seems to me, father, it would be better to lay for the giant.\"    \"What folly is that, lass? I'd be main glad to give the giant a dose of  what he gave me, but he'll leave town to-night, and I ain't big enough  to tackle him, even if I had the chance. So I'll revenge myself on his  friend, the boy. The kid may be his son, for aught I know.\"    \"And what will you do for him, father?\" asked Janet, pertinaciously.  \"You won't kill him?\"    \"Well, I won't go so far as that, for I've no mind to put my neck in a  noose, but I'll flog him within an inch of his life. I'll teach him to  mind his own business for the future.\"    Janet knew her father's strength and brutality, and she shuddered at the  idea of the boy being exposed to it. She knew very well it would be of  no use to make a protest. She would only get herself into trouble. Yet  she couldn't reconcile herself to the thought of poor Kit being cruelly  punished. She asked herself what she could do to prevent it.    There was one thing in favor of a rescue. She knew where Kit was  confined. If it were not so late she would steal out, and going to the  cabin relieve him from captivity. But it was too late, and too dark for  that. Besides, she could not leave her father's cabin without  observation.    \"I will wait till to-morrow morning,\" she said to herself.    It so chanced that on account of some slight repairs the mine in which  her father was employed was shut down for a few days. This was  favorable, for he would lie in bed till eight o'clock at least, and  there would be a chance to get out without observation.    The next morning, about five o'clock, Janet rose from her bed, hastily  dressed herself, and crept to the door of her father's chamber. He was  sound asleep, and breathing heavily. There was small chance of his  awakening before seven o'clock.    Janet took a little meat and bread in a tin pail, for she thought the  captive might be in need of breakfast, and then, putting a sharp knife  in her pocket to cut the ropes that bound him, she left the house and  took her way over the hill to the deserted cabin which served as Kit's  prison.          CHAPTER XXVIII.    KIT RESCUED BY A GIRL.      Kit had succeeded in getting a little sleep during the night, but his  position was necessarily constrained and he was but very slightly  refreshed. Moreover he was a prey to anxiety, for he did not know what  fate awaited him on the succeeding day.    At four o'clock in the morning a little light found its way into the  cabin through a small window at the rear. The other windows were boarded  up.    Kit, appreciating the desirability of escaping before a visit should be  made him by his captors, tried hard to work himself out of his bonds,  but only succeeded in confining himself more closely than before.    \"What will they do to me?\" he asked himself anxiously.    He had heard from some of the circus men accounts of the roughness and  brutality of the miners, or at least of a certain class of them, for  some were quiet and peaceable men, and he knew that there was no extreme  of which they were not capable. Life is sweet, and to a boy of sixteen,  in good health and strength, it is especially dear. Suppose he should  lose his life in this region? Probably none of his friends would ever  learn what had become of him, and his uncle and cousin would not  scruple to spread rumors to his discredit.    It was certainly tantalizing that he should be tied hand and foot,  utterly unable to help himself.    More and more light crept in at the window, and there was every  indication of its being a glorious day. But this prospect brought no  pleasure to poor Kit.    \"Before this time the circus people must have found out my absence,\" he  thought. \"Will they take the trouble to look for me?\"    Kit was on good terms with his comrades, indeed he was popular with them  all, as a bright boy is apt to be, and he did not like to think that no  effort would be made to find him. Still, as he could not help owning to  himself, they had no clew that was likely to lead to success. He had  given no one notice where he was going, and his capture was not likely  to have been observed by any one.    While he was indulging in these sorrowful reflections, his attention was  drawn to a noise at the window.    \"They can't have come back so early,\" he said to himself in surprise.    He twisted himself round to catch a glimpse, if possible, of the early  visitor, and to his delight, he caught a partial view of Janet's dress.  Suppose she should prove a deliverer, he said to himself with beating  heart.    The visitor, whoever it was, was evidently trying to peer into the  cabin. Kit was so placed in a corner as to be almost out of sight in the  dark interior. He felt that he must attract attention.    \"Hallo, there!\" he cried in a loud clear voice.    \"He's there!\" thought Janet, \"just as father said.\"    \"Let me out!\" cried Kit, eagerly. \"Draw out the bolt, and open the  door!\"    \"Will she do it, or will she be frightened away?\" he asked himself, with  his heart filled with suspense.    He did not have long to wait for an answer, and a favorable one. He  heard the bolt withdrawn, then the door was opened, and the girl's face  appeared. Janet Hayden was small, not especially pretty, and rather  old-fashioned in looks, but to poor Kit she seemed like an angel.    \"Are you the circus boy?\" she asked timidly.    \"Yes; I am tied here. Have you got a knife to cut this rope?\"    \"Yes; I brought one with me.\"    \"Then you knew I was here?\" Kit asked in surprise.    \"Yes; it was my father that locked you up here--my father and another  man.\"    \"Will you cut the rope and let me go, then?\"    \"Yes; that is what I came for.\"    The little maid went up to the captive, bent over, and with considerable  sawing, for the knife she had with her was a dull case knife, succeeded  in severing the rope, and Kit was able to rise and stand upon his feet.  It was a perfect luxury to feel himself once more free and unshackled.    \"I'm very much obliged to you,\" he said, gratefully. \"You can't imagine  how stiff I am.\"    \"I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22523"],[0,"The History of the American Expedition Fighting the Bolsheviki (#20)"],[1," same when one considers  that this detachment was composed of Americans, Canadians, and Russians,  of every conceivable, type and description, and orders issued to one  body might be and usually were entirely misunderstood by the others.    Shortly after this, however, the Cossack Colonel desired to vindicate  his troops and a new attack was planned in which the Cossacks, supported  by their own artillery, were to launch a drive against the enemy at  Kodima. After a big night's pow-wow and a typical Cossack demonstration  of swearing eternal allegiance to their leader and boasting of the dire  punishment they were going to inflict upon the enemy, they sallied forth  from Shenkursk with their banners gaily flying. No word was heard from  them until the following evening when just at dusk across the river  came, galloping like mad, the first news-bearers of our valiant cohorts.  On gaining the shelter of Shenkursk, most of them were completely  exhausted and many of their horses dropped dead from over-exertion on  the way, while others died in Shenkursk.    Our first informants described at great detail a thrilling engagement in  which they had participated and how they had fought until their  ammunition became exhausted, when they were forced to retreat. Others  described in detail how Prince Aristoff and his Adjutant, Captain  Robins, of the British Army, had fought bravely to the last and when  about to be taken prisoners, used the last bullets remaining in their  pistols to end their lives, thus preventing capture. More and more of  the scattered legion were constantly arriving, and each one had such a  remarkably different story to tell from that of his predecessor, that by  the following morning, we were all inclined to doubt all of the stories.    However, it is true that Colonel Aristoff and Robins failed to return,  and we were compelled for the time being to assume that at least part of  the stories were true. The Cossacks immediately went into deep mourning  for the loss of their valiant leader and affected great grief and  sorrow. This, however, did not prevent them from ransacking the  Colonel's headquarters and carrying off all his money and jewelry and,  in fact, about everything that he owned. Four days later, however, in  the midst of all this mourning and demonstrations, we were again treated  to a still greater surprise, for that afternoon who should come riding  into the village but the Colonel himself along with his adjutant. It can  be readily imagined what scrambling and endeavor there was on the part  of the sorrowing ones to return undetected to the Colonel's headquarters  his stolen property and belongings. For days thereafter, the garrison  resounded to the cracking of the Colonel's knout, and this time the  wailing and shedding of tears was undoubtedly more real than any that  had been shed previously to that time. These various unfortunate  affairs, while harmful enough in themselves, did far greater harm than  such incidents would ordinarily warrant, in this respect, that they gave  the enemy greater and greater confidence all along, meanwhile lowering  the morale of our Russian cohorts as well as our own troops.    And here we leave these hardy Yanks, far, far to the south of Archangel.  When their story is picked up again in the narrative, it will be found  to be one of the most thrilling stories in American military exploits.        VIII    PEASANTRY OF THE ARCHANGEL PROVINCE    Russian Peasant Born Linguist--Soldiers See Village Life--Communal  Strips Of Land Tilled By Grandfather's Methods--Ash Manure--Rapid Growth  During Days Of Perpetual Daylight--Sprinkling Cattle With Holy  Water--\"Sow In Mud And You Will Be A Prince\"--Cabbage Pie At  Festival--Home-Brewed \"Braga\" More Villainous Than Vodka--Winter  Occupations And Sports--North Russian Peasants Less Illiterate Than  Commonly Supposed.    The province of Archangel is in the far north or forest region of  Russia. It is a land of forest and morass, plentifully supplied with  water in the form of rivers, lakes and marshes, along the banks of which  are scant patches of cultivated land, which is invariably the location  of a village. Throughout the whole of this province the climate is very  severe. For more than half of the year the ground is covered by deep  snow and the rivers are completely frozen. The arable land all told  forms little more than two per cent of the vast area. The population is  scarce and averages little more at the most than two to the square mile,  according to the latest figures, about 1905.    During the late fall and early winter, shortly after Company \"A\" had  been relieved at Ust Padenga, we were stationed in the village of  Shegovari. Here we had considerable leisure at our disposal and  consequently the writer began devoting more time to his linguistic  studies. Difficult as the language seems to be upon one's first  introduction to it, it was not long before I was able to understand much  of what was said to me, and to express myself in a vague roundabout way.  In the latter operation I was much assisted by a peculiar faculty of  divination which the Russian peasant possesses to a remarkably high  degree. If a foreigner succeeds in expressing about one-fourth of an  idea, the Russian peasant can generally fill up the remaining  three-fourths from his own intuition. This may perhaps be readily  understood when one considers that a great majority of the upper classes  speak French or German fluently and a great number English as well.  Then, too, the many and varied races that have united and intermingled  to form the Russian race may offer an equally satisfactory explanation.    Shegovari may be taken as a fair example of the villages throughout the  northern half of Russia, and a brief description of its inhabitants will  convey a correct notion of the northern peasantry in general. The  village itself is located about forty versts above Shenkursk on the  banks of the Vaga river, which meanders and winds about the village so  that the river is really on both sides. On account of this location  there is more arable land surrounding the village than is found in the  average community and dozens of villages are clustered about this  particular location, the villages devoting most of their time to  agricultural pursuits.    I believe it may safely be said that nearly the whole of the female  population and about one-half the male inhabitants are habitually  engaged in cultivating the communal land, which comprises perhaps five  hundred acres of light, sandy soil. As is typical throughout the  province this land is divided into three large fields, each of which is  again subdivided into strips. The first field is reserved for one of the  most important grains, i.e., rye, which in the form of black bread, is  the principal food of the population. In the second are raised oats for  the horses and here and there some buckwheat which is also used for  food. The third field lies fallow and is used in the summer for  pasturing the cattle.    This method of dividing the land is so devised in order to suit the  triennial rotation of crops, a very simple system, but quite practical  nevertheless. The field which is used this year for raising winter  grain, will be used next summer for raising summer grain and in the  following year will lie fallow. Every family possesses in each of the  two fields under cultivation one or more of the subdivided strips, which  he is accountable for and which he must cultivate and attend to.    The arable lands are of course carefully manured because the soil at its  best is none too good and would soon exhaust it. In addition to manuring  the soil the peasant has another method of enriching the soil. Though  knowing nothing of modern agronomical chemistry, he, as well as his  forefathers, have learned that if wood be burnt on a field and the ashes  be mixed with the soil, a good harvest may be expected. This simple  method accounts for the many patches of burned forest area, which we at  first believed to be the result of forest fires. When spring comes round  and the leaves begin to appear, a band of peasants, armed with their  short hand axes, with which they are most dextrous, proceed to some spot  previously decided upon and fell all trees, great and small within the  area. If it is decided to use the soil in that immediate vicinity, the  fallen trees are allowed to remain until fall, when the logs for  building or firewood are dragged away as soon as the first snow falls.  The rest of the piles, branches, etc., are allowed to remain until the  following spring, at which time fires may be seen spreading in all  directions. If the fire does its work properly, the whole of the space  is covered with a layer of ashes, and when they have been mixed with the  soil the seed is sown, and the harvest, nearly always good, sometimes  borders on the miraculous. Barley or rye may be expected to produce  about six fold in ordinary years and they may produce as much as thirty  fold under exceptional circumstances!    In most countries this method of treating the soil would be an absurdly  expensive one, for wood is entirely too valuable a commodity to be used  for such a purpose, but in this northern region the forests are so  boundless and the inhabitants so few that the latter do not make any  great inroad upon the former.    The agricultural year in this region begins in April, with the melting  snows. Nature which has been lying dormant for some six months, now  awakes and endeavors to make up for lost time. No sooner does the snow  disappear than the grass immediately sprouts forth and the shrubs and  trees begin to bud. The rapidity of this transition from winter to  spring certainly astonished the majority of us, accustomed as we were to  more temperate climes.
