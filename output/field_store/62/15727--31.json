Where wolves and coyotes are plentiful and natural conditions are  favorable, blind sets are very successful, especially for the wary  animals that refuse to take bait. Conditions must be favorable in  order to make blind set trapping feasible. There must be plenty of  good clear trails traversing the country, and a comparatively rough  locality will be found to be the best as, on rough ground, the wolves  are more certain to walk on the trails.    It is only, perhaps, a small per cent. of the trappers who are able  to make a success of blind sets, for it requires one who is very  observing and a diligent worker. To make a fair catch requires that  one runs a long line of traps, for he must depend on putting his trap  just where the wolf will step, instead of decoying the animal into  the trap by means of a bait, and no matter how careful he is in this  matter, he is certain to set a lot of traps in bad places.    On the other hand, if food is plentiful and the wolves do not take  bait well, or if they have become shy and wary because of persistent  trapping, one is more likely to make a showing if he uses blind sets,  in part at least. Then, too, he may be more certain of pulling in the  \"old veterans.\"    The reason that the blind set is more certain for the wary animals is  that there is no bait to arouse the suspicions of the intended  victim, and it is taken when completely off its guard. Such animals  as the wolf, coyote and fox are always suspicious of a bait even  though there is no trap there, and will sometimes steer clear of it  for several days, simply because they think there may be something  wrong there. They approach a baited trap warily and if they detect  any disturbance or sign of human presence, they are off for good.  With the blind set, that would not occur and if the trap is in the  proper place, the trapper may be pretty certain of the animal when it  comes that way.    In all parts of the wolf and coyote country, trails of some kind are  to be found. On the Western Plains the stock trails are numerous and  offer great possibilities for blind trapping. In the mountains, game  trails are to be found and as such trails invariably lead through  passes and other natural passage-ways they make excellent places for  wolf sets, if on the animals' route. In the northern forests, moose,  caribou, and deer trails are plentiful and good places for blind sets  are to be found.    Main trails are the best always, unless one finds that the animals  are traveling on the branches. The trail leading to the crossing  place of a deep washout is an excellent place in which to set a trap.  Unless the trail traverses a natural pass or leads to the crossing of  a ravine, it is always best to be sure that the animals are traveling  the trail before setting traps.      [Illustration: A Good Catch.]    A narrow, well defined portion of the trail should be selected, and  if there are bunches of brush, cactus or weeds on either side, so  much better. A single trap may be used but as the animal is likely to  step over it without springing, two traps are better. They should be  attached to drags of some sort; either stones, chunks of wood or the  pronged, iron drags. If the traps are staked the captured animal will  tear up the trail and the next one that passes that way will stop to  investigate and may locate the trap. With other sets, it is sometimes  better to let the captured coyote or wolf scratch up the setting but  with the trail set, it is best to use a drag.    A piece of canvas or cow or sheep hide should be spread on the ground  and the trapper should stand on it while making the set, and should  also use it as a receptacle for the loose dirt. A hole should be dug  for each trap, the same shape as the trap when set, but a little  larger, and of such a depth that when the trap is covered, the  covering will be even with the surface of the ground. A narrow trench  should be made for the chain and a hole in which to place the drag.  The drag should be buried as far from the trap as the chain will  allow.    The traps should be set with the jaws lying lengthwise of the trail.  After filling in neatly with dirt around the springs and the outside  of the jaws, a sheet of clean paper should be placed over the trap  and covered with from one fourth to one half inch of fine dirt,  covering the edges of the paper first to prevent it from sagging.  When finished the whole should be brushed smooth and the surplus dirt  carried away.    Sometimes one can find a long, deep ravine which is practically  impassable to wolves and coyotes. At such places one may find small  branches running out to the side and wherever there is such a branch,  there is sure to be a trail at the first crossing place. Such a trail  is sure to be used by the animals when traveling along the canyon for  when they strike the lateral branch, they are certain to follow it to  the first crossing place. That is the place to set a trap for them.    One of the trappers who is located on the coyote range of the  Northwest, writes: \"There are several ways of trapping for the coyote  but none of them will hold good very long. The coyote will soon get  on to the way you trap, and know as well where your trap is as you  do.\"    The most successful way I have found is to take two No. 3 and No. 4  Newhouse traps and wire the rings together hard and fast. Set them in  trails that are used by the coyotes. Dig a hole in the trails the  right size for the traps. Double the chains up and put them under the  traps, cover the traps lightly with dust, leaving everything as  normal as possible. Two traps together make your chances double for a  catch, and the loose trap answers for a drag. The coyote will not go  far until he becomes entangled for keeps. I never use bait only to  draw the coyote to some place where there are lots of trails leading  in all directions. These trails I monopolize with traps as just  described. I set it in the most likely looking place, then take a  large sized bait, fasten it in a thicket in the vicinity of the  traps, and your chances are good for a catch.\"    Another trapper gives his method in the following: \"In setting traps  for wolves and coyotes, I set them mostly on the trails made by  stock. I use steel pins made from rake teeth. With a short handled  axe I cut out a place in the trail so the trap will be level with the  top of the ground when covered. I use paper over the jaws and set two  No. 4 traps at a setting, putting them fourteen or twenty inches  apart. A wolfs foot is good for brushing the dirt over the traps so  as to make everything look as natural as possible. I use a pair of  gloves in handling my traps and set them where the trail is narrow  and on a little knoll, or where the trail goes around a bank or  between two hills.    \"Leave all wolf and coyote carcasses near the traps after skinning  them, as they make a good decoy. A good plan is to throw your rope  around a piece of meat and drag it from your saddle horn. Take a  dozen No. 4 traps and go up and down the dusty trail and set them on  the drag mark. If you hide them well, you will get Mr. Wolf or  Coyote. I do not use bait in warm weather and not much in cold  weather. A grey wolf is hard to catch by bait, unless very hungry and  he is seldom troubled that way where there are cattle and horses on  the range.\"        CHAPTER XVI.    SNOW SET METHODS.    When the ground is covered with snow, trapping for wolves is  exceedingly difficult and there are few, if any trappers who can make  a success of it. Throughout Northern Minnesota, Wisconsin and  Michigan, as well as in Canada, a few are caught by the most  persistent hunters, but the winter catch never amounts to much.    It is difficult to make a set in the snow and leave no signs when the  set is finished, and even if one can make a neat set it will seldom  remain long in working order. This is the rule, but there is one  exception, a set which is successful, but can only be used in places  where the winter temperature is such that the snow will remain a long  time in a loose, powdery condition. In other words it can only be  used successfully in the North, where the weather is very cold. The  method referred to is the one used by the northern Indians for  trapping both the fox and wolf. It is made as follows:    Having the trap attached to a heavy clog, and well cleaned by boiling  or washing, go out onto the ice of some windswept lake and scrape up  a pile of snow. Make it cone-shaped about three feet in height and  six or seven feet in diameter at the base. Bury the clog, or drag, in  the mound, and stretch up the chain, so as to bring the trap to the  top. Make the mound hard by beating it with a snowshoe, and in the  top, scoop a hole about five inches deep and somewhat larger than the  trap. Line this hole well with dry moss or cat-tail down, the down is  best, and place the trap in the nest. Fill inside of the jaws, and  under the pan with cat-tail down and after the trap has become cold,  so that there is no danger of the snow sticking to it, sift snow over  it, to the depth of an inch. Do not touch this snow with the hands or  it will freeze hard and the trap will not spring.      [Illustration: A Snow Set.]    The bait should be cut into small pieces and tucked into the sides of  the snow mound, where it will be out of sight of the birds. Brush out  your tracks as you go away and the wind will soon erase every vestige  of signs, leaving the snow as smooth as it was before the trap was  set, but the mound will freeze hard and no amount of wind can drift  it away.    Such a set will remain in working order as long as the weather stays  cold. A fresh fall of snow will bury the set for a short time but the  wind storm that always follows a snowfall will blow all loose snow  off the mound, leaving just a sufficient amount over the trap, as  that "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3457"],[0,"The Man of the Forest (#20)"],[1,"ls. The forest  that he struck into seemed ribbed like a washboard with deep ravines  so steep of slope as to make precarious travel. Mostly he kept to the  bottom where dry washes afforded a kind of trail. But it was necessary  to cross these ravines when they were too long to be headed, and this  crossing was work.    The locust thickets characteristic of these slopes were thorny and close  knit. They tore and scratched and stung both horses and riders. Ranger  appeared to be the most intelligent of the horses and suffered less.  Bo's white mustang dragged her through more than one brambly place. On  the other hand, some of these steep slopes, were comparatively free of  underbrush. Great firs and pines loomed up on all sides. The earth was  soft and the hoofs sank deep. Toward the bottom of a descent Ranger  would brace his front feet and then slide down on his haunches. This  mode facilitated travel, but it frightened Helen. The climb out then on  the other side had to be done on foot.    After half a dozen slopes surmounted in this way Helen's strength was  spent and her breath was gone. She felt light-headed. She could not get  enough air. Her feet felt like lead, and her riding-coat was a burden.  A hundred times, hot and wet and throbbing, she was compelled to stop.  Always she had been a splendid walker and climber. And here, to break up  the long ride, she was glad to be on her feet. But she could only drag  one foot up after the other. Then, when her nose began to bleed, she  realized that it was the elevation which was causing all the trouble.  Her heart, however, did not hurt her, though she was conscious of an  oppression on her breast.    At last Roy led into a ravine so deep and wide and full of forest  verdure that it appeared impossible to cross. Nevertheless, he started  down, dismounting after a little way. Helen found that leading Ranger  down was worse than riding him. He came fast and he would step right  in her tracks. She was not quick enough to get away from him. Twice  he stepped on her foot, and again his broad chest hit her shoulder and  threw her flat. When he began to slide, near the bottom, Helen had to  run for her life.    \"Oh, Nell! Isn't--this--great?\" panted Bo, from somewhere ahead.    \"Bo--your--mind's--gone,\" panted Helen, in reply.    Roy tried several places to climb out, and failed in each. Leading down  the ravine for a hundred yards or more, he essayed another attempt.  Here there had been a slide, and in part the earth was bare. When he had  worked up this, he halted above, and called:    \"Bad place! Keep on the up side of the hosses!\"    This appeared easier said than done. Helen could not watch Bo, because  Ranger would not wait. He pulled at the bridle and snorted.    \"Faster you come the better,\" called Roy.    Helen could not see the sense of that, but she tried. Roy and Bo had dug  a deep trail zigzag up that treacherous slide. Helen made the mistake  of starting to follow in their tracks, and when she realized this Ranger  was climbing fast, almost dragging her, and it was too late to get  above. Helen began to labor. She slid down right in front of Ranger. The  intelligent animal, with a snort, plunged out of the trail to keep from  stepping on her. Then he was above her.    \"Lookout down there,\" yelled Roy, in warning. \"Get on the up side!\"    But that did not appear possible. The earth began to slide under Ranger,  and that impeded Helen's progress. He got in advance of her, straining  on the bridle.    \"Let go!\" yelled Roy.    Helen dropped the bridle just as a heavy slide began to move with  Ranger. He snorted fiercely, and, rearing high, in a mighty plunge he  gained solid ground. Helen was buried to her knees, but, extricating  herself, she crawled to a safe point and rested before climbing farther.    \"Bad cave-in, thet,\" was Roy's comment, when at last she joined him and  Bo at the top.    Roy appeared at a loss as to which way to go. He rode to high ground and  looked in all directions. To Helen, one way appeared as wild and rough  as another, and all was yellow, green, and black under the westering  sun. Roy rode a short distance in one direction, then changed for  another.    Presently he stopped.    \"Wal, I'm shore turned round,\" he said.    \"You're not lost?\" cried Bo.    \"Reckon I've been thet for a couple of hours,\" he replied, cheerfully.  \"Never did ride across here I had the direction, but I'm blamed now if I  can tell which way thet was.\"    Helen gazed at him in consternation.    \"Lost!\" she echoed.        CHAPTER IX    A silence ensued, fraught with poignant fear for Helen, as she gazed  into Bo's whitening face. She read her sister's mind. Bo was remembering  tales of lost people who never were found.    \"Me an' Milt get lost every day,\" said Roy. \"You don't suppose any man  can know all this big country. It's nothin' for us to be lost.\"    \"Oh!... I was lost when I was little,\" said Bo.    \"Wal, I reckon it'd been better not to tell you so offhand like,\"  replied Roy, contritely. \"Don't feel bad, now. All I need is a peek at  Old Baldy. Then I'll have my bearin'. Come on.\"    Helen's confidence returned as Roy led off at a fast trot. He rode  toward the westering sun, keeping to the ridge they had ascended, until  once more he came out upon a promontory. Old Baldy loomed there, blacker  and higher and closer. The dark forest showed round, yellow, bare spots  like parks.    \"Not so far off the track,\" said Roy, as he wheeled his horse. \"We'll  make camp in Milt's senaca to-night.\"    He led down off the ridge into a valley and then up to higher altitude,  where the character of the forest changed. The trees were no longer  pines, but firs and spruce, growing thin and exceedingly tall, with  few branches below the topmost foliage. So dense was this forest that  twilight seemed to have come.    Travel was arduous. Everywhere were windfalls that had to be avoided,  and not a rod was there without a fallen tree. The horses, laboring  slowly, sometimes sank knee-deep into the brown duff. Gray moss  festooned the tree-trunks and an amber-green moss grew thick on the  rotting logs.    Helen loved this forest primeval. It was so still, so dark, so gloomy,  so full of shadows and shade, and a dank smell of rotting wood, and  sweet fragrance of spruce. The great windfalls, where trees were jammed  together in dozens, showed the savagery of the storms. Wherever a single  monarch lay uprooted there had sprung up a number of ambitious sons,  jealous of one another, fighting for place. Even the trees fought one  another! The forest was a place of mystery, but its strife could be read  by any eye. The lightnings had split firs clear to the roots, and others  it had circled with ripping tear from top to trunk.    Time came, however, when the exceeding wildness of the forest, in  density and fallen timber, made it imperative for Helen to put all her  attention on the ground and trees in her immediate vicinity. So the  pleasure of gazing ahead at the beautiful wilderness was denied her.  Thereafter travel became toil and the hours endless.    Roy led on, and Ranger followed, while the shadows darkened under the  trees. She was reeling in her saddle, half blind and sick, when Roy  called out cheerily that they were almost there.    Whatever his idea was, to Helen it seemed many miles that she followed  him farther, out of the heavy-timbered forest down upon slopes of low  spruce, like evergreen, which descended sharply to another level, where  dark, shallow streams flowed gently and the solemn stillness held a low  murmur of falling water, and at last the wood ended upon a wonderful  park full of a thick, rich, golden light of fast-fading sunset.    \"Smell the smoke,\" said Roy. \"By Solomon! if Milt ain't here ahead of  me!\"    He rode on. Helen's weary gaze took in the round senaca, the circling  black slopes, leading up to craggy rims all gold and red in the  last flare of the sun; then all the spirit left in her flashed up in  thrilling wonder at this exquisite, wild, and colorful spot.    Horses were grazing out in the long grass and there were deer grazing  with them. Roy led round a corner of the fringed, bordering woodland,  and there, under lofty trees, shone a camp-fire. Huge gray rocks loomed  beyond, and then cliffs rose step by step to a notch in the mountain  wall, over which poured a thin, lacy waterfall. As Helen gazed in  rapture the sunset gold faded to white and all the western slope of the  amphitheater darkened.    Dale's tall form appeared.    \"Reckon you're late,\" he said, as with a comprehensive flash of eye he  took in the three.    \"Milt, I got lost,\" replied Roy.    \"I feared as much.... You girls look like you'd done better to ride with  me,\" went on Dale, as he offered a hand to help Bo off. She took it,  tried to get her foot out of the stirrups, and then she slid from the  saddle into Dale's arms. He placed her on her feet and, supporting her,  said, solicitously: \"A hundred-mile ride in three days for a tenderfoot  is somethin' your uncle Al won't believe.... Come, walk if it kills  you!\"    Whereupon he led Bo, very much as if he were teaching a child to walk.  The fact that the voluble Bo had nothing to say was significant to  Helen, who was following, with the assistance of Roy.    One of the huge rocks resembled a sea-shell in that it contained a  hollow over which the wide-spreading shelf flared out. It reached toward  branches of great pines. A spring burst from a crack in the solid rock.  The campfire blazed under a pine, and the blue column of smoke rose just  in front of the shelving rock. Packs were lying on the grass and some  of them were open. There were no signs here of a permanent habitation of  the hunter. But farther on were other huge rocks, leaning, cracked, and  forming caverns, some of which perhaps he utilized.    \"My camp is just back,\" said Dale, as if he had read Helen's mind.  \"To-morrow we'll fix "]]]
