Scoop out the soft pulp and seeds, brush  each basket over lightly with olive oil and sprinkle with finely chopped  garden cress or parsley. Fill the baskets with Mayonnaise Dressing or  Sauce Tartare (see recipe Page 84). Chill and serve in nests of  peppergrass or lettuce heart leaves.      FRENCH FRIED POTATOES    Wash and pare medium-sized potatoes, cut them lengthwise in eight pieces  of a uniform size. Soak them in cold water two hours, changing the water  several times. Drain from water and dry between towels. Then fry a few  at a time in deep hot Cottolene. Drain on brown paper and sprinkle with  salt. This is an easy method of preparing potatoes in hot weather. The  potatoes may be prepared beforehand and the process of cooking is both  simply and quickly done. Be sure the Cottolene is not too hot as the  potatoes must be cooked through, as well as browned.      BOILED SWEET CORN    Have the water boiling. Remove the husks and silk from the corn and drop  them at once into the boiling water; bring water quickly to boiling  point and let boil rapidly five to ten minutes (depending somewhat on  age of corn). Drain from water and arrange in a napkin-covered platter;  serve at once.      FROZEN APRICOTS    Drain the apricots from the liquor in the can. Reserve liquor and cut  fruit in one-fourth inch cubes. To the syrup add sufficient water to  make four cups; add one cup orange juice; add one and one-half cups  sugar. Cook five minutes, strain and pour over apricots; chill and  freeze. Fresh apricots or peaches may be used when in season. The fresh  fruit should be cooked until clear, in a syrup made of four cups of  water and two cups sugar. When this mixture is frozen to a mush, two  cups of Whipped Cream may be added, if one desires a richer dessert.      SULTANA CAKE              1/3 cup Cottolene.            1 cup sugar.            2 eggs.            1 egg yolk.            1 cup Sultana raisins.            1/2 cup milk.            2-1/4 cups pastry flour.            4 teaspoons baking powder.            1/4 teaspoon salt.            1/2 teaspoon mace.    PROCESS: Cream Cottolene, add sugar gradually, stirring constantly; add  well-beaten eggs and yolk. Mix and sift flour (except one tablespoon),  baking powder and salt and mace; add to first mixture alternately with  milk. Dredge raisins with tablespoon flour, add to mixture and beat  thoroughly. Turn mixture into a well-greased, brick-shaped bread pan and  bake forty minutes in a moderate oven. Frost if desired.

CHAPTER XIV. A PRODIGAL RETURNS      Aunt Olivia and the Story Girl lived in a whirlwind of dressmaking after  that, and enjoyed it hugely. Cecily and Felicity also had to have  new dresses for the great event, and they talked of little else for a  fortnight. Cecily declared that she hated to go to sleep because she  was sure to dream that she was at Aunt Olivia's wedding in her old faded  gingham dress and a ragged apron.    \"And no shoes or stockings,\" she added, \"and I can't move, and everyone  walks past and looks at my feet.\"    \"That's only in a dream,\" mourned Sara Ray, \"but I may have to wear my  last summer's white dress to the wedding. It's too short, but ma says  it's plenty good for this summer. I'll be so mortified if I have to wear  it.\"    \"I'd rather not go at all than wear a dress that wasn't nice,\" said  Felicity pleasantly.    \"I'd go to the wedding if I had to go in my school dress,\" cried Sara  Ray. \"I've never been to anything. I wouldn't miss it for the world.\"    \"My Aunt Jane always said that if you were neat and tidy it didn't  matter whether you were dressed fine or not,\" said Peter.    \"I'm sick and tired of hearing about your Aunt Jane,\" said Felicity  crossly.    Peter looked grieved but held his peace. Felicity was very hard on him  that spring, but his loyalty never wavered. Everything she said or did  was right in Peter's eyes.    \"It's all very well to be neat and tidy,\" said Sara Ray, \"but I like a  little style too.\"    \"I think you'll find your mother will get you a new dress after all,\"  comforted Cecily. \"Anyway, nobody will notice you because everyone will  be looking at the bride. Aunt Olivia will make a lovely bride. Just  think how sweet she'll look in a white silk dress and a floating veil.\"    \"She says she is going to have the ceremony performed out here in  the orchard under her own tree,\" said the Story Girl. \"Won't that be  romantic? It almost makes me feel like getting married myself.\"    \"What a way to talk,\" rebuked Felicity, \"and you only fifteen.\"    \"Lots of people have been married at fifteen,\" laughed the Story Girl.  \"Lady Jane Gray was.\"    \"But you are always saying that Valeria H. Montague's stories are silly  and not true to life, so that is no argument,\" retorted Felicity, who  knew more about cooking than about history, and evidently imagined that  the Lady Jane Gray was one of Valeria's titled heroines.    The wedding was a perennial source of conversation among us in those  days; but presently its interest palled for a time in the light of  another quite tremendous happening. One Saturday night Peter's mother  called to take him home with her for Sunday. She had been working at Mr.  James Frewen's, and Mr. Frewen was driving her home. We had never seen  Peter's mother before, and we looked at her with discreet curiosity. She  was a plump, black-eyed little woman, neat as a pin, but with a rather  tired and care-worn face that looked as if it should have been rosy and  jolly. Life had been a hard battle for her, and I rather think that her  curly-headed little lad was all that had kept heart and spirit in her.  Peter went home with her and returned Sunday evening. We were in the  orchard sitting around the Pulpit Stone, where we had, according to the  custom of the households of King, been learning our golden texts and  memory verses for the next Sunday School lesson. Paddy, grown sleek and  handsome again, was sitting on the stone itself, washing his jowls.    Peter joined us with a very queer expression on his face. He seemed  bursting with some news which he wanted to tell and yet hardly liked to.    \"Why are you looking so mysterious, Peter?\" demanded the Story Girl.    \"What do you think has happened?\" asked Peter solemnly.    \"What has?\"    \"My father has come home,\" answered Peter.    The announcement produced all the sensation he could have wished. We  crowded around him in excitement.    \"Peter! When did he come back?\"    \"Saturday night. He was there when ma and I got home. It give her an  awful turn. I didn't know him at first, of course.\"    \"Peter Craig, I believe you are glad your father has come back,\" cried  the Story Girl.    \"'Course I'm glad,\" retorted Peter.    \"And after you saying you didn't want ever to see him again,\" said  Felicity.    \"You just wait. You haven't heard my story yet. I wouldn't have been  glad to see father if he'd come back the same as he went away. But he is  a changed man. He happened to go into a revival meeting one night this  spring and he got converted. And he's come home to stay, and he says  he's never going to drink another drop, but he's going to look after his  family. Ma isn't to do any more washing for nobody but him and me, and  I'm not to be a hired boy any longer. He says I can stay with your Uncle  Roger till the fall 'cause I promised I would, but after that I'm to  stay home and go to school right along and learn to be whatever I'd like  to be. I tell you it made me feel queer. Everything seemed to be upset.  But he gave ma forty dollars--every cent he had--so I guess he really is  converted.\"    \"I hope it will last, I'm sure,\" said Felicity. She did not say it  nastily, however. We were all glad for Peter's sake, though a little  dizzy over the unexpectedness of it all.    \"This is what I'D like to know,\" said Peter. \"How did Peg Bowen know my  father was coming home? Don't you tell me she isn't a witch after that.\"    \"And she knew about your Aunt Olivia's wedding, too,\" added Sara Ray.    \"Oh, well, she likely heard that from some one. Grown up folks talk  things over long before they tell them to children,\" said Cecily.    \"Well, she couldn't have heard father was coming home from any one,\"  answered Peter. \"He was converted up in Maine, where nobody knew him,  and he never told a soul he was coming till he got here. No, you can  believe what you like, but I'm satisfied at last that Peg is a witch and  that skull of hers does tell her things. She told me father was coming  home and he come!\"    \"How happy you must be,\" sighed Sara Ray romantically. \"It's just like  that story in the Family Guide, where the missing earl comes home to his  family just as the Countess and Lady Violetta are going to be turned out  by the cruel heir.\"    Felicity sniffed.    \"There's some difference, I guess. The earl had been imprisoned for  years in a loathsome dungeon.\"    Perhaps Peter's father had too, if we but realized it--imprisoned in the  dungeon of his own evil appetites and habits, than which none could  be more loathsome. But a Power, mightier than the forces of evil, had  struck off his fetters and led him back to his long-forfeited liberty  and light. And no countess or lady of high degree could have welcomed a  long-lost earl home more joyfully than the tired little washerwoman had  welcomed the erring husband of her youth.    But in Peter's ointment of joy there was a fly or two. So very, very few  things are flawless in this world, even on the golden road.    \"Of course I'm awful glad that father has come back and that ma won't  have to wash any more,\" he said with a sigh, \"but there are two things  that kind of worry me. My Aunt Jane always said that it didn't do any  good to worry, and I s'pose it don't, but it's kind of a relief.\"    \"What's worrying you?\" asked Felix.    \"Well, for one thing I'll feel awful bad to go away from you all. I'll  miss you just dreadful, and I won't even be able to go to the same  school. I'll have to go to Markdale school.\"    \"But you must come and see us often,\" said Felicity graciously.  \"Markdale isn't so far away, and you could spend every other Saturday  afternoon with us anyway.\"    Peter's black eyes filled with adoring gratitude.    \"That's so kind of you, Felicity. I'll come as often as I can, of  course; but it won't be the same as being around with you all the time.  The other thing is even worse. You see, it was a Methodist revival  father got converted in, and so of course he joined the Methodist  church. He wasn't anything before. He used to say he was a Nothingarian  and lived up to it--kind of bragging like. But he's a strong Methodist  now, and is going to go to Markdale Methodist church and pay to the  salary. Now what'll he say when I tell him I'm a Presbyterian?\"    \"You haven't told him, yet?\" asked the Story Girl.    \"No, I didn't dare. I was scared he'd say I'd have to be a Methodist.\"    \"Well, Methodists are pretty near as good as Presbyterians,\" said  Felicity, with the air of one making a great concession.    \"I guess they're every bit as good,\" retorted Peter. \"But that ain't the  point. I've got to be a Presbyterian, 'cause I stick to a thing when I  once decide it. But I expect father will be mad when he finds out.\"    \"If he's converted he oughtn't to get mad,\" said Dan.    \"Well, lots o' people do. But if he isn't mad he'll be sorry, and  that'll be even worse, for a Presbyterian I'm bound to be. But I expect  it will make things unpleasant.\"    \"You needn't tell him anything about it,\" advised Felicity. \"Just keep  quiet and go to the Methodist church until you get big, and then you can  go where you please.\"    \"No, that wouldn't be honest,\" said Peter sturdily. \"My Aunt Jane  always said it was best to be open and above board in everything, and  especially in religion. So I'll tell father right out, but I'll wait a  few weeks so as not to spoil things for ma too soon if he acts up.\"    Peter was not the only one who had secret cares. Sara Ray was beginning  to feel worried over her looks. I heard her and Cecily talking over  their troubles one evening while I was weeding the onion bed and they  were behind the hedge knitting lace. I did not mean to eavesdrop.  I supposed they knew I was there until Cecily overwhelmed me with  indignation later on.    \"I'm so afraid, Cecily, that I'm going to be homely all my life,\" said  poor Sara with a tremble in her voice. \"You can stand being ugly when"]]]
