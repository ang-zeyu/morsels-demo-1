Nor did their trouble go  unrewarded. The expectations of the most sanguine were outdone by the  wonders disclosed.    Baily (to whose narrative we again have recourse) had set up his  Dollond's achromatic in an upper room of the University of Pavia, and  was eagerly engaged in noting a partial repetition of the singular  appearances seen by him in 1836, when he was \"astounded by a tremendous  burst of applause from the streets below, and at the same moment was  electrified at the sight of one of the most brilliant and splendid  phenomena that can well be imagined. For at that instant the dark body  of the moon was suddenly surrounded with a corona, or kind of bright  glory similar in shape and relative magnitude to that which painters  draw round the heads of saints, and which by the French is designated an  _aureole_. Pavia contains many thousand inhabitants, the major part of  whom were, at this early hour, walking about the streets and squares or  looking out of windows, in order to witness this long-talked-of  phenomenon; and when the total obscuration took place, which was  _instantaneous_, there was a universal shout from every observer, which  'made the welkin ring,' and, for the moment, withdrew my attention from  the object with which I was immediately occupied. I had indeed  anticipated the appearance of a luminous circle round the moon during  the time of total obscurity; but I did not expect, from any of the  accounts of preceding eclipses that I had read, to witness so  magnificent an exhibition as that which took place.... The breadth of  the corona, measured from the circumference of the moon, appeared to me  to be nearly equal to half the moon's diameter. It had the appearance of  brilliant rays. The light was most dense close to the border of the  moon, and became gradually and uniformly more attenuate as its distance  therefrom increased, assuming the form of diverging rays in a  rectilinear line, which at the extremity were more divided, and of an  unequal length; so that in no part of the corona could I discover the  regular and well-defined shape of a ring at its _outer_ margin. It  appeared to me to have the sun for its centre, but I had no means of  taking any accurate measures for determining this point. Its colour was  quite white, not pearl-colour, nor yellow, nor red, and the rays had a  vivid and flickering appearance, somewhat like that which a gaslight  illumination might be supposed to assume if formed into a similar  shape.... Splendid and astonishing, however, as this remarkable  phenomenon really was, and although it could not fail to call forth the  admiration and applause of every beholder, yet I must confess that there  was at the same time something in its singular and wonderful appearance  that was appalling; and I can readily imagine that uncivilised nations  may occasionally have become alarmed and terrified at such an object,  more especially at times when the true cause of the occurrence may have  been but faintly understood, and the phenomenon itself wholly  unexpected.    \"But the most remarkable circumstance attending the phenomenon was the  appearance of _three large protuberances_ apparently emanating from the  circumference of the moon, but evidently forming a portion of the  corona. They had the appearance of mountains of a prodigious elevation;  their colour was red, tinged with lilac or purple; perhaps the colour of  the peach-blossom would more nearly represent it. They somewhat  resembled the snowy tops of the Alpine mountains when coloured by the  rising or setting sun. They resembled the Alpine mountains also in  another respect, inasmuch as their light was perfectly steady, and had  none of that flickering or sparkling motion so visible in other parts of  the corona. All the three projections were of the same roseate cast of  colour, and very different from the brilliant vivid white light that  formed the corona; but they differed from each other in magnitude....  The whole of these three protuberances were visible even to the last  moment of total obscuration; at least, I never lost sight of them when  looking in that direction; and when the first ray of light was admitted  from the sun, they vanished, with the corona, altogether, and daylight  was instantaneously restored.\"[154]    Notwithstanding unfavourable weather, the \"red flames\" were perceived  with little less clearness and no less amazement from the Superga than  at Pavia, and were even discerned by Mr. Airy with the naked eye. \"Their  form\" (the Astronomer Royal wrote) \"was nearly that of saw-teeth in the  position proper for a circular saw turned round in the same direction in  which the hands of a watch turn.... Their colour was a full lake-red,  and their brilliancy greater than that of any other part of the  ring.\"[155]    The height of these extraordinary objects was estimated by Arago at two  minutes of arc, representing, at the sun's distance, an actual elevation  of 54,000 miles. When carefully watched, the rose-flush of their  illumination was perceived to fade through violet to white as the light  returned, the same changes in a reversed order having accompanied their  first appearance. Their forms, however, during about three minutes of  visibility, showed no change, although of so apparently unstable a  character as to suggest to Arago \"mountains on the point of crumbling  into ruins\" through topheaviness.[156]    The corona, both as to figure and extent, presented very different  appearances at different stations. This was no doubt due to varieties in  atmospheric conditions. At the Superga, for instance, all details of  structure seem to have been effaced by the murky air, only a  comparatively feeble ring of light being seen to encircle the moon.  Elsewhere, a brilliant radiated formation was conspicuous, spreading at  four opposite points into four vast luminous expansions, compared to  feather-plumes or _aigrettes_.[157] Arago at Perpignan noticed  considerable irregularities in the divergent rays. Some appeared curved  and twisted, a few lay _across_ the others, in a direction almost  tangential to the moon's limb, the general effect being described as  that of a \"hank of thread in disorder.\"[158] At Lipeszk, where the sun  stood much higher above the horizon than in Italy or France, the corona  showed with surprising splendour. Its apparent extent was judged by  Struve to be no less than twenty-five minutes (more than six times  Airy's estimate), while the great plumes spread their radiance to three  or four degrees from the dark lunar edge. So dazzling was the light that  many well-instructed persons denied the totality of the eclipse. Nor was  the error without precedent, although the appearances attending  respectively a total and an annular eclipse are in reality wholly  dissimilar. In the latter case, the surviving ring of sunlight becomes  so much enlarged by irradiation, that the interposed dark lunar body is  reduced to comparative insignificance, or even invisibility. Maclaurin  tells us[159] that during an eclipse of this character which he observed  at Edinburgh in 1737, \"gentlemen by no means shortsighted declared  themselves unable to discern the moon upon the sun without the aid of a  smoked glass;\" and Baily (who, however, _was_ shortsighted) could  distinguish, in 1836, with the naked eye, no trace of \"the globe of  purple velvet\" which the telescope revealed as projected upon the face  of the sun.[160] Moreover, the diminution of light is described by him  as \"little more than might be caused by a temporary cloud passing over  the sun\"; the birds continued in full song, and \"one cock in particular  was crowing with all his might while the annulus was forming.\"    Very different were the effects of the eclipse of 1842, as to which some  interesting particulars were collected by Arago.[161] Beasts of burthen,  he tells us, paused in their labour, and could by no amount of  punishment be induced to move until the sun reappeared. Birds and beasts  abandoned their food; linnets were found dead in their cages; even ants  suspended their toil. Diligence-horses, on the other hand, seemed as  insensible to the phenomenon as locomotives. The convolvulus and some  other plants closed their leaves, but those of the mimosa remained open.  The little light that remained was of a livid hue. One observer  described the general coloration as resembling the lees of wine, but  human faces showed pale olive or greenish. We may, then, rest assured  that none of the remarkable obscurations recorded in history were due to  eclipses of the annular kind.    The existence of the corona is no modern discovery. Indeed, it is too  conspicuous an apparition to escape notice from the least attentive or  least practised observer of a total eclipse. Nevertheless, explicit  references to it are rare in early times. Plutarch, however, speaks of a  \"certain splendour\" compassing round the hidden edge of the sun, as a  regular feature of total eclipses;[162] and the corona is expressly  mentioned in a description of an eclipse visible at Corfu in 968  A.D.[163] The first to take the phenomenon into scientific consideration  was Kepler. He showed, from the orbital positions at the time of the sun  and moon, that an eclipse observed by Clavius at Rome in 1567 could not  have been annular,[164] as the dazzling coronal radiance visible during  the obscuration had caused it to be believed. Although he himself never  witnessed a total eclipse of the sun, he carefully collected and  compared the remarks of those more fortunate, and concluded that the  ring of \"flame-like splendour\" seen on such occasions was caused by the  reflection of the solar rays from matter condensed in the neighbourhood  either of the sun"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28257"],[0,"The Story of the Great War, Volume 1 (#20)"],[1,"was fatally exposed, should Bulgaria enter the war  against Serbia. In the Treaty of Bucharest, Greece and Rumania had  undertaken to join Serbia should she be attacked by Bulgaria, and  the mission of Greece was to cover the Saloniki railroad as far  north as it was necessary to join hands with the Serbians.    Now, while the Bulgarians were beginning to mobilize and the  Austro-German hosts were gathering to the north, Serbia appealed to  her former allies to keep their agreement. Both declined, and their  refusal was fatal. The Allies had relied upon Greek promises, and  had failed to collect any considerable force at Saloniki. They had  trusted Bulgaria and refused to let Serbia attack her neighbor  before Bulgarian mobilization was complete. Once Bulgaria had  mobilized the doom of Serbia was settled.    What happened was this: The Germans forced the passage of the Danube  north and east of Belgrade and came south along the broad Morava  River Valley, driving the Serbs before them. Thanks to the heavy  artillery of the invaders Serbian resistance was impotent. The  Austrians, meantime, crossed the Drin and came east from Bosnia.  Think of Serbia as a rectangle and you can visualize two sides of  the figure as closing in on the center, which was the heart of  Serbia.    At the appointed moment the Bulgarians struck west from a third side  of the rectangle, speedily crossed the Belgrade-Nish-Saloniki  railroad, and thus cut off the true line of Serbian retreat, that  upon Saloniki.    Very early in the campaign the Bulgars seized Uskub, thus  interposing a wedge between the small Anglo-French force at Saloniki  and the Serbs about Nish to the north of Uskub. Meantime a desperate  concentration was taking place at Saloniki, and an Anglo-French  force, commanded by Sarrail, was being pushed up the Saloniki  railroad toward Uskub to open a road to the Serbs to join their  allies. The operation suggested that successfully conducted in  Flanders in the opening months of the war, which enabled the Belgian  army to escape from Antwerp and join their allies in Flanders.    But this operation failed. The French came north to the outskirts of  Veles, twenty miles from Uskub, just too late to save the Serbians,  who now fled west to Monastir and south to Montenegro and Albania.  As a fighting force the Serbs were eliminated, the wrecks of their  armies barely escaping to the Adriatic and Aegean coasts at Durazzo  and Saloniki. Bulgarian troops forced the Katchanik gorges and took  Prisrend, and German and Austrian forces entered the ill-omened  Plain of Kossovo and overran the ancient Sanjak of Novibazar.    Before the storm that was now moving south, the French and British  retreated upon Saloniki, and presently began to construct about this  Greek city lines and defenses recalling those Wellington built at  Torres Vedras before Lisbon to restrain the flood of Napoleonic  invasion in the Iberian peninsula. The conquest of the Balkan  peninsula, save for Greece, was now as complete as Napoleon's own  success in Spain had been more than a century before.    In due course of time an Austrian army repeated the operations of  the Germans, this time succeeding in reducing the strongholds of  Montenegro, which had defied the Turk through long centuries. Mount  Lovetcen, the peak which looks down upon Cattaro and commands the  inner bay, was at last taken, Scutari followed, northern Albania was  overrun, Nicholas followed Peter into exile. All Macedonia was taken  and the Allies forced out of Serbia, which had become an entirely  conquered country. To complete the conquest of the Near East there  was needed nothing but a successful siege of Saloniki, but this  required preparation and the rebuilding of destroyed railroads, and  so the Allies found respite in this Aegean port for a brief time.    Such was Germany's third campaign. Her victory enabled her to send  munitions to Constantinople, and insured the failure of the allied  attack at the Dardanelles. Only a few weeks later the allied armies  evacuated the Gallipoli Peninsula; thus testifying to the decisive  character of the German operation. Still later Turkish reenforcements,  doubtless drawing upon German sources for munitions, defeated another  British expedition almost under the walls of Bagdad and drove it in  retreat down the Tigris, ultimately surrounding it at Kut-el-Amara, a  hundred miles to the south.    Again, there came immediately forecasts of another Turkish thrust at  Suez, under German direction, a first attack having failed in the  previous winter. Whether Germany actually obtained any considerable  stock of provisions or foodstuffs may be doubted by her succor, but  it is clear that her campaign had enabled her to make use of many  thousands of Turkish troops, who were waiting only for arms, it had  given her control of the Bulgarian army, a small but efficient  force, and it had provided an eventual means of attacking the  British Empire by land, once the advance upon Egypt could be  organized.    This last circumstance is worth noting, for the time had now arrived  when the Germans perceived that Great Britain had so far escaped  injury, was the single one of the larger powers who had drawn profit  without terrible loss from the war and was becoming the determining  force in the allied camp, because its resources were still  unexhausted and its armies only just coming into the field, while  German numbers were approaching a positive decline. If Germany could  reach Suez, conquer Egypt, using Turkish armies and German genius  and munitions, she would deal a heavy blow to the British Empire,  and she might compel the British to listen to proposals for peace,  which were now contemptuously thrust aside by London.    In sum, the Serbian campaign saved Turkey, disposed of Serbia,  enlisted Bulgaria, opened the road to the Near East and to  subsequent attacks upon Egypt and perhaps upon India, but it did not  bring peace, and it did not inflict any immediate injury upon any  one of Germany's larger foes, only Serbia and Montenegro actually  suffered serious loss, and the destruction of their armies was but a  detail in a world war.      ITALY    For the purposes of a summary it is unnecessary to review in detail  the Italian operations. They have no distinctive challenge to the  reader. Italian statesmanship imposed upon the Italian high command  a task which made immediate victory impossible, and assigned to  Italy the useful but inglorious role of occupying some 400,000  Austrian troops, and thus contributing to the strain imposed upon  the Central Powers and to the hastening of the moment when  exhaustion might be expected to set in.    Had Italy decided to enter the war at the moment when Russia was  destroying Austrian armies in Galicia in September and October of  1914 she would almost unquestionably have supplied the necessary  numbers to bring a speedy and decisive defeat for the Central  Powers. Again, had she selected the moment when Russian armies were  at the crests of the Carpathians, and Przemysl had just fallen, she  would have probably made the German offense against Russia  impossible, brought Rumania in with her, and produced the collapse  of Austria. Bulgaria would not have enlisted with the Central  Powers, Greece would almost certainly have attacked Turkey, and the  Balkan campaign would not have taken place.    But German diplomacy averted the second peril, and Italian alignment  with Austria and with Germany in the Triple Alliance made an attack  at the opening of the war unthinkable. When Italy did come in, the  German victory in Galicia had been won, Russia was in retreat, the  allied defeat before the Dardanelles forts and the Russian disasters  had produced a profound effect in Balkan capitals, and Austria was  able to find the troops to meet and check the Italian advance almost  at the frontier. Since that time the Italian operations have been  merely trench conflicts, and Italy has nowhere penetrated a score of  miles into Austrian territory, nor has she taken Trieste, Trent, or  even Gorizia.    If one desires a parallel for the Italian operations it is to be  found in the later phases of the Peninsula War against Napoleon.  This field was never of decisive importance, but it did require the  attention of several of Napoleon's best marshals, and drew off  thousands of French soldiers needed by the great emperor in the  campaigns in eastern Germany, where his fortunes were finally  decided. What Wellington did, the Italians under Cadorna have been  imitating in their own peninsula, and their service to their allies  has thus been very considerable.    Nor is it necessary for the purposes of so rapid a review of the  main phases of the war to dwell upon the allied failure in the west  between the end of the battles of Flanders in November, 1914, and  February, 1916. At the beginning of 1915 what were allied hopes and  purposes in the west? Unquestionably French and British public  believed that with the coming year the Grand Alliance would be able  to crush Germany. Unquestionably French and British high commands  planned to open the summer with a drive that would clear France and  Belgium. As for the Germans, having laid their plans to go to  Russia, they asked nothing of their western armies save that the  lines should be held.    The French began their spring drive in Artois and in Champagne. The  Artois fighting of May and June was exceedingly severe, incidental  gains were made, but the British were suddenly disclosed lacking in  all proper ammunition, lacking in numbers to support the French  offensive, and barely able to hold their own lines about Ypres,  after desperate fighting, made memorable by the first use by the  Germans of gas as a weapon of offense.    From June until September the western armies stood still, while  Britain organized her munition manufactures and continued to send  her new troops to"]]]
