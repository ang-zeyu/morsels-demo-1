In extreme cases it may be necessary to break the mold  carefully. However, there should be no undercuts to hold the fish.    Carefully wash the fish as it lays on the board to remove all clay and  plaster which may be on the upper surface. With the fingers smooth out  any wrinkles or uneven places. Sometimes, when drying, small wrinkles or  bubbles may appear in the skin of such fish as trout, but they will soon  disappear. If you placed the fish in a natural position when making the  mold and properly adjusted the cleaned skin to the mold, there should be  no wrinkles.    Place thin pieces of wood the shape of the fins between the board and  the dorsal and anal fins, which should stand out from the board a little  way. Cover the tail and the fins which lie flat with thin pieces of  wood, pinning them to the board until dry. The fins which do not lie  flat should be spread between thin pieces of wood held in place with  pins or clips.    When the surface of the fish is dry, which will be in from six to twelve  hours, give it a coat of the very best white varnish (the ordinary  yellow varnish will not do) and put the specimen in a well ventilated  place out of the sun to dry. In three or four days when the fins are  dry, remove the thin pieces of wood and apply another coat of varnish.    CAUTION.--Arsenic is poison and should be kept out of the way of  children and animals. Keep the box covered when not in use.    Cuts in the hand can be protected by covering them with liquid court  plaster. Clean the finger nails carefully when through work, washing the  hands in warm water containing a few drops of carbolic acid.    FINISHING.--While the fish is drying secure uncolored glass eyes with  the properly shaped black pupils and paint the iris from your sketch.  When the specimen is thoroughly dry, in two or three weeks, dig a  sufficient amount of clay out of the eye opening and put in the glass  eye, setting it in papier mache. Use the prepared mache, which only  requires boiling with water for preparation. When the mache is dry, give  the exposed portion of it one or two coats of paint of the proper color.    Now do such painting as may be necessary--for instance, the spots and  fins of the brook trout, colors of which have doubtless vanished by this  time. Use tube paint, thinned with the white varnish. Usually it is  sufficient to place a small quantity of the paint of the proper color  directly into the varnish. Do not use much of the paint--just enough to  secure the color and yet not obscure the scales. Where the markings are  prominent, put some of the paint directly on the fish and spread it with  the varnish. Brilliant spots, such as those of the trout, can be  reproduced by the use of the paints without the varnish.    While the specimen is drying prepare a panel for it. To show the fish to  the best advantage, the panel should be of polished hardwood, although  stained pine will answer. Bore two holes about half way through the  panel from the back, slanting upward, by which to hang it. (See Fig. 8.)  Bore two holes entirely through the panel in the proper places and screw  the fish to it, putting in the screws from the back of the panel and  into the fish where the wood is thickest. Countersink the screws.    [Illustration: HOME MADE PANEL. (Fig. 8)]    Finally, apply a last coat of the varnish. Do not varnish the glass eye.  By keeping a piece of writing paper between the panel and your brush you  can varnish the fish without getting any on the panel. It is best to put  on the final coat after the specimen is mounted on the panel, because if  the fish is handled before the varnish is hard finger marks will show.    [Illustration: SIDE VIEW. (Fig. 9)]    MOUNTING HEADS.--With a sharp knife or saw cut the head off squarely  just back of first (pectoral) fins, as shown in Figs. 9 and 10, which  show the head of a black bass. In this case the ventral fins are also  left on. Place the head on a board with the cut part down, spreading the  fins as in Fig. 10. If it is to be displayed with open mouth, fill the  mouth with cotton or cloth to exclude the plaster. Cover the whole head  with plaster.    [Illustration: FRONT VIEW. (Fig. 10)]    After the plaster sets, with a saw and knife cut the mold into two parts  lengthwise, being careful not to cut into the head. Use the saw first  and when the plaster is cut down close to the skin use the knife  carefully. Do not attempt to remove the head before cutting the mold in  two.    Remove flesh and cartilage from the head, line with aluminum leaf, and  proceed as previously instructed. Of course none of the tongue is to be  removed if the mouth is to be left open, in which case do not remove the  bony parts of the gills. Before placing the cleaned skin in the mold,  tie the two parts of the mold together. Cut a neck board to fit and set  it in plaster. Finish as previously advised.          CHAPTER XXII.    MOUNTING REPTILES, FROGS AND TOADS.      The largest reptile of the United States, the alligator, is mounted by  methods applied to medium sized animals. Leg, head and tail rods are  stapled to a stout back board and after building up the legs from tow  the larger part of the body is filled by stuffing with coarse tow or  fine excelsior. Let the skin rest back down while engaged in this,  sewing up the skin as it proceeds, with stout twine and a sail needle.  You may even need to use the awl to pierce the armor like skin.    For any natural position the leg irons need not be heavy as this animal  usually keeps its body and tail in contact with the ground. The leg rods  are clinched or bolted beneath the pedestal as in other quadrupeds and  in addition some long screws are turned into the back board from below  and the tail held down by wire fastened to its central support and  clinched beneath the pedestal.    All but the smallest lizards are mounted in the same way as the small  fur-bearers. There is apparently no known mode of \"stuffing\" a snake so  as to resemble its natural state.    The skin must be placed on a carefully modelled manikin with a plastic  layer between. For small snakes tow is wound on a wire and shaped with  thread, and excelsior is used in the same way for the large ones.    The larger manikins are to be posed and paper coated in most cases  before receiving the skin. Frogs and toads are also very difficult to  mount in natural positions, but are nicely represented in painted casts.    Frogs, however, possess the distinction of not having to be sewed up,  when skinned as they usually are through the mouth. In doing this the  entire body is dissected away through the mouth and the legs are  detached and skinned the same way.    After turning completely wrong side out and poisoning the legs are  wired, wrapped with tow or cotton in the same manner as other small  animals. One hind leg wire is cut long enough to reach through the body  and head and to this the other leg wires are twisted. Some claim that to  leave the vertebral column attached to the skin of the back is an  invaluable aid in giving that part its proper shape.    [Illustration: WIRING SYSTEM FOR FROG.]    The body filling is tow or cotton placed through the mouth in small  pieces until the proper shape is acquired. Dry sand has been used to  fill the bodies of frogs, being poured in the mouth through a funnel and  retained by a cotton plug until the skin was dry, when it was poured  out.    Painting and varnishing are required to finish mounted frogs. The frog  is a favorite with the caricaturist as it can be made to take almost any  human posture with laughable results.    Turtles may be mounted by wrapping and wiring legs, tail and head like  other small animals, after detaching the under shell on three sides,  removing the body and skinning the limbs. The tow wrapped legs should  have a covering of soft clay which can be shaped with the fingers after  they are returned to the skin.    Twisting the wires together is all right for the small turtles, large  ones need a block of wood to clinch the wires in. The under shell is  replaced and fastened with small wires and as enough skin was left  attached to it to sew to, all cuts are closed that way. Heavy wires are  seldom necessary in turtles. Those having bright colored shells will  need to be touched up with paint and all should be varnished thinly to  give a fresh appearance.          CHAPTER XXIII.    SKULLS AND SKELETONS.      While the preparation of skeletons for the cabinet is sometimes  undertaken by the general taxidermist it is more often the work of a  trained osteologist. Collectors in the field are often asked to preserve  rough skeletons of desirable varieties and the skulls at least should be  preserved with the skin of each quadruped taken for mounting.    A specimen with a damaged or imperfect skin may yield a good skeleton  and in the case of something very rare both the skin and skeleton may be  mounted separately. This process is one calling for a skilled operator  as all claws, nails or hoofs should remain on the skin while their bony  cores are part of the skeleton.    In the preservation of rough skeletons, skinning by any method is the  first step, next the removal of the viscera, etc., then the most of the  flesh and muscle should be dissected off the bones, after which poison  with dry arsenic and put where it will dry out quickly and be out of the  reach of foraging animals.    The legs of small animals should be unjointed as well as the skull and  after trimming be put inside the body cavity and securely tied to  prevent loss; birds are treated about the same and all large animals are  pretty thoroughly taken apart in order to properly clean the bones.    Always remember that a skeleton with parts cut away or bones lost is  about as good as none. Leave any cartilage attachments and any parts of  a bony nature for the osteologist, to be "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23280"],[0,"The Shirley Letters from California Mines in 1851-52 (#20)"],[1," the monotony. I must  mention that the floor is so uneven that no article of furniture gifted  with four legs pretends to stand upon but three at once, so that the  chairs, tables, etc., remind you constantly of a dog with a sore foot.    At each end of the mantelpiece is arranged a candlestick, not, much to  my regret, a block of wood with a hole in the center of it, but a real  britanniaware candlestick. The space between is gayly ornamented with  F.'s meerschaum, several styles of clay pipes, cigars, cigarritos, and  every procurable variety of tobacco, for, you know, the aforesaid  individual is a perfect devotee of the Indian weed. If I should give  you a month of Sundays, you would never guess what we use in lieu of a  bookcase, so I will put you out of your misery by informing you  instantly that it is nothing more nor less than a candle-box which  contains the library, consisting of a Bible and prayer-book,  Shakespeare, Spenser, Coleridge, Shelley, Keats, Lowell's Fable for  Critics, Walton's Complete Angler, and some Spanish books,--spiritual  instead of material lights, you see.    There, my dainty Lady Molly, I have given you, I fear, a wearisomely  minute description of my new home. How would you like to winter in such  an abode? in a place where there are no newspapers, no churches,  lectures, concerts, or theaters; no fresh books; no shopping, calling,  nor gossiping little tea-drinkings; no parties, no balls, no picnics,  no tableaus, no charades, no latest fashions, no daily mail (we have an  express once a month), no promenades, no rides or drives; no vegetables  but potatoes and onions, no milk, no eggs, no _nothing_? Now, I expect  to be very happy here. This strange, odd life fascinates me. As for  churches, \"the groves were God's first temples,\" \"and for the strength  of the hills, the Swiss mountains bless him\"; and as to books, I read  Shakespeare, David, Spenser, Paul, Coleridge, Burns, and Shelley, which  are never old. In good sooth, I fancy that nature intended me for an  Arab or some other nomadic barbarian, and by mistake my soul got packed  up in a Christianized set of bones and muscles. How I shall ever be  able to content myself to live in a decent, proper, well-behaved house,  where toilet-tables are toilet-tables, and not an ingenious combination  of trunk and claret-cases, where lanterns are not broken bottles,  bookcases not candle-boxes, and trunks not wash-stands, but every  article of furniture, instead of being a makeshift, is its own useful  and elegantly finished self, I am sure I do not know. However, when too  much appalled at the humdrummish prospect, I console myself with the  beautiful promises, that \"sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof,\"  and \"as thy days, so shall thy strength be,\" and trust that when it is  again my lot to live amid the refinements and luxuries of civilization,  I shall endure them with becoming philosophy and fortitude.

Letter _the_ Eighth    LIFE _and_ CHARACTERS _at_ INDIAN BAR    _From our Log Cabin_, INDIAN BAR,    _October_ 20, 1851.      Having seen me, dear M., safely enthroned in my beautiful log palace  with its outer walls all tapestried with moss, perhaps you would like a  description of the coronation-dinner!    You must know that \"Ned,\" the Paganini of the Humboldt, (who, by the  way, is almost an historic, or, better perhaps, naval, character,  inasmuch as he was _cook_ on board of the Somers when her captain  performed his little tragedy, to the horror of an entire nation,) had  been in such a state of ecstasy ever since he had heard of the promised  advent of Mrs. ----, that his _proprietors_, as Ned grandly calls them,  had serious fears of being compelled to strait-jacket him.    \"You see, sir,\" said Ned, \"when the queen\" (with Ned, as with the rest  of the world, \"a substitute shines brightly as a queen until a queen be  by,\"--and I am the only petticoated astonishment on this Bar) \"arrives,  _she_ will appreciate my culinary efforts. It is really discouraging,  sir, after I have exhausted my skill in preparing a dish, to see the  gentlemen devour it with as much unconcern as though it had been cooked  by a mere bungler in our art\"!    When we entered our new home, we found the cloth--it was a piece left  of that which lined the room overhead--already laid. As it was unhemmed  and somewhat tattered at the ends, an imaginative mind might fancy it  fringed on purpose, though, like the poor little Marchioness with her  orange-peel and water, one would have to _make believe_ very hard.  Unfortunately, it was not wide enough for the table, and a dashing  border of white pine banded each side of it. Ned had invested an  unknown quantity of gold-dust in a yard of diaper,--awfully  coarse,--which, divided into four pieces, and fringed to match the  tablecloth, he had placed napkin-wise in the tumblers. He had evidently  ransacked the whole bar to get viands wherewith to decorate the various  dishes, which were as follows.        _First Course_      OYSTER SOUP        _Second Course_      FRIED SALMON CAUGHT FROM THE RIVER        _Third Course_      ROAST BEEF & BOILED HAM        _Fourth Course_      FRIED OYSTERS        _Vegetables_      POTATOES & ONIONS        _Pastry_      MINCE PIE, & PUDDING MADE WITHOUT EGGS OR MILK        _Dessert_      MADEIRA NUTS & RAISINS        _Wines_      CLARET & CHAMPAGNE        _Coffee_    I found that Ned had not overrated his powers. The dinner, when one  considers the materials of which it was composed, was really excellent.  The soup was truly a great work of art; the fried oysters dreamily  delicious; and as to the coffee, Ned must have got the receipt for  making it from the very angel who gave the beverage to Mahomet to  restore that individual's decayed moisture.    Ned himself waited, dressed in a brand-new flannel shirt and calico  ditto, his hair--he is a light mulatto--frizzled to the most intense  degree of corkscrewity, and a benign and self-satisfied smile  irradiating his face, such as _should_ illumine the features of a great  artist when he knows that he has achieved something, the memory of  which the world will not willingly let die. In truth, he needed but  white kid gloves to have been worthy of standing behind the chair of  Count d'Orsay himself. So grand was his air, so ceremonious his every  motion, that we forgot we were living in the heart of the Sierra  Nevada; forgot that our home was a log cabin of mere primitive  rudeness; forgot that we were sitting at a rough pine table covered  with a ragged piece of four-cent cotton cloth, eating soup with iron  spoons!    I wish, my funny little Molly, that you could have been here  clairvoyantly. It was one of those scenes, just touched with that fine  and almost imperceptible _perfume_ of the ludicrous, in which you  especially delight. There are a thousand minute shreds of the absurd  which my duller sense overlooks, but which never can hope to escape  your mirth-loving vision.    Ned really plays beautifully on the violin. There is a white man, by  the name of \"Chock,\" who generally accompanies him. Of course, true  daughter of Eve that you are, you will wish to know \"right off\" what  Chock's _other_ name is. Young woman, I am ashamed of you! Who ever  asks for the _other_ name of Alexander, of Hannibal, of Homer? Suffice  it that he is Chock by himself,--Chock, and assistant violinist to  Paganini Vattal Ned.    Ned and one of his musical cronies--a white man--gave me a serenade the  other evening. As it was quite cold, F. made them come inside the  cabin. It was the richest thing possible, to see the patronizing and  yet serene manner with which Ned directed his companion what marches,  preludes, etc., to play for the amusement of that profound culinary and  musical critic, Dame Shirley.    It must be confessed that Ned's love of the beautiful is not quite so  correct as his taste in cooking and violin-playing. This morning a  gentle knock at my door was followed by that polite person, bearing in  triumph a small waiter, purloined from the Humboldt, on which stood in  state, festooned with tumblers, a gaudy pitcher, which would have  thrown Tearsoul and Lelie into ecstasies of delight. It was almost as  wonderful a specimen of art as my chintz hanging. The groundwork is  pure white, upon which, in bas-relief, are _executed_ two  diabolical-looking bandits, appallingly bewhiskered and mustached,  dressed in red coats, yellow pantaloons, green boots, orange-colored  caps with brown feathers in them, and sky-blue bows and arrows. Each of  the fascinating vagabonds is attended by a bird-of-paradise-colored  dog, with a crimson tail waggingly depicted. They are embowered beneath  a morning-glory vine, evidently a species of the Convolvulus unknown in  America, as each one of its pink leaves, springing from purple stems,  is three times the size of the bandit's head."]]]
