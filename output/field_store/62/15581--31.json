I will explain there.\"    He followed her into the little enclosure where the red and white  roses were now in full blow.    \"Father isn't angry with you,\" said Lynde in a low shamed voice. \"It's  just--he takes strange moods sometimes. Then he seems to hate us  all--even me--and he is like that for days. He seems to suspect and  dread everybody as if they were plotting against him. You--perhaps you  think he has been drinking? No, that is not the trouble. These  terrible moods come on without any cause that we know of. Even Mother  could not do anything with him when he was like that. You must go away  now--and do not come back until his dark mood has passed. He will be  just as glad to see you as ever then, and this will not make any  difference with him. Don't come back for a week at least.\"    \"I do not like to leave you in such trouble, Miss Oliver.\"    \"Oh, it doesn't matter about me--I have Emily. And there is nothing  you could do. Please go at once. Father knows I am talking to you and  that will vex him still more.\"    Alan, realizing that he could not help her and that his presence only  made matters worse, went away perplexedly. The following week was a  miserable one for him. His duties were distasteful to him and meeting  his people a positive torture. Sometimes Mrs. Danby looked dubiously  at him and seemed on the point of saying something--but never said it.  Isabel King watched him when they met, with bold probing eyes. In his  abstraction he did not notice this any more than he noticed a certain  subtle change which had come over the members of his congregation--as  if a breath of suspicion had blown across them and troubled their  confidence and trust. Once Alan would have been keenly and instantly  conscious of this slight chill; now he was not even aware of it.    When he ventured to go back to Four Winds he found the Captain on the  point of starting off for a cruise in his yacht. He was urbane and  friendly, utterly ignoring the incident of Alan's last visit and  regretting that business compelled him to go down the lake. Alan saw  him off with small regret and turned joyfully to Lynde, who was  walking under the pines with her dogs. She looked pale and tired and  her eyes were still troubled, but she smiled proudly and made no  reference to what had happened.    \"I'm going to put these flowers on Mother's grave,\" she said, lifting  her slender hands filled with late white roses. \"Mother loved flowers  and I always keep them near her when I can. You may come with me if  you like.\"    Alan had known Lynde's mother was buried under the pines but he had  never visited the spot before. The grave was at the westernmost end of  the pine wood, where it gave out on the lake, a beautiful spot, given  over to silence and shadow.    \"Mother wished to be buried here,\" Lynde said, kneeling to arrange her  flowers. \"Father would have taken her anywhere but she said she wanted  to be near us and near the lake she had loved so well. Father buried  her himself. He wouldn't have anyone else do anything for her. I am so  glad she is here. It would have been terrible to have seen her taken  far away--my sweet little mother.\"    \"A mother is the best thing in the world--I realized that when I lost  mine,\" said Alan gently. \"How long is it since your mother died?\"    \"Three years. Oh, I thought I should die too when she did. She was  very ill--she was never strong, you know--but I never thought she  could die. There was a year then--part of the time I didn't believe in  God at all and the rest I hated Him. I was very wicked but I was so  unhappy. Father had so many dreadful moods and--there was something  else. I used to wish to die.\"    She bowed her head on her hands and gazed moodily on the ground. Alan,  leaning against a pine tree, looked down at her. The sunlight fell  through the swaying boughs on her glory of burnished hair and lighted  up the curve of cheek and chin against the dark background of wood  brown. All the defiance and wildness had gone from her for the time  and she seemed like a helpless, weary child. He wanted to take her in  his arms and comfort her.    \"You must resemble your mother,\" he said absently, as if thinking  aloud. \"You don't look at all like your father.\"    Lynde shook her head.    \"No, I don't look like Mother either. She was tiny and dark--she had a  sweet little face and velvet-brown eyes and soft curly dark hair. Oh,  I remember her look so well. I wish I did resemble her. I loved her  so--I would have done anything to save her suffering and trouble. At  least, she died in peace.\"    There was a curious note of fierce self-gratulation in the girl's voice  as she spoke the last sentence. Again Alan felt the unpleasant  impression that there was much in her that he did not understand--might  never understand--although such understanding was necessary to perfect  friendship. She had never spoken so freely of her past life to him  before, yet he felt somehow that something was being kept back in  jealous repression. It must be something connected with her father,  Alan thought. Doubtless, Captain Anthony's past would not bear  inspection, and his daughter knew it and dwelt in the shadow of her  knowledge. His heart filled with aching pity for her; he raged secretly  because he was so powerless to help her. Her girlhood had been  blighted, robbed of its meed of happiness and joy. Was she likewise to  miss her womanhood? Alan's hands clenched involuntarily at the  unuttered question.    On his way home that evening he again met Isabel King. She turned and  walked back with him but she made no reference to Four Winds or its  inhabitants. If Alan had troubled himself to look, he would have seen  a malicious glow in her baleful brown eyes. But the only eyes which  had any meaning for him just then were the grey ones of Lynde Oliver.           *       *       *       *       *    During Alan's next three visits to Four Winds he saw nothing of Lynde,  either in the house or out of it. This surprised and worried him.  There was no apparent difference in Captain Anthony, who continued to  be suave and friendly. Alan always enjoyed his conversations with the  Captain, who was witty, incisive, and pungent; yet he disliked the man  himself more at every visit. If he had been compelled to define his  impression, he would have said the Captain was a charming scoundrel.    But it occurred to him that Emily was disturbed about something.  Sometimes he caught her glance, full of perplexity and--it almost  seemed--distrust. She looked as if she felt hostile towards him. But  Alan dismissed the idea as absurd. She had been friendly from the  first and he had done nothing to excite her disapproval. Lynde's  mysterious absence was a far more perplexing problem. She had not gone  away, for when Alan asked the Captain concerning her, he responded  indifferently that she was out walking. Alan caught a glint of  amusement in the older man's eyes as he spoke. He could have sworn it  was malicious amusement.    One evening he went to Four Winds around the shore. As he turned the  headland of the cove, he saw Lynde and her dogs not a hundred feet  away. The moment she saw him she darted up the bank and disappeared  among the firs.    Alan was thunderstruck. There was no room for doubt that she meant to  avoid him. He walked up to the house in a tumult of mingled feelings  which he did not even then understand. He only realized that he felt  bitterly hurt and grieved--puzzled as well. What did it all mean?    He met Emily in the yard of Four Winds on her way to the spring and  stopped her resolutely.    \"Miss Oliver,\" he said bluntly, \"is Miss Lynde angry with me? And  why?\"    Emily looked at him piercingly.    \"Have you no idea why?\" she asked shortly.    \"None in the world.\"    She looked at him through and through a moment longer. Then, seeming  satisfied with her scrutiny, she picked up her pail.    \"Come down to the spring with me,\" she said.    As soon as they were out of sight of the house, Emily began abruptly.    \"If you don't know why Lynde is acting so, I can't tell you, for I  don't know either. I don't even know if she is angry. I only thought  perhaps she was--that you had done or said something to vex  her--plaguing her to go to church maybe. But if you didn't, it may not  be anger at all. I don't understand that girl. She's been different  ever since her mother died. She used to tell me everything before  that. You must go and ask her right out yourself what is wrong. But  maybe I can tell you something. Did you write her a letter a  fortnight ago?\"    \"A letter? No.\"    \"Well, she got one then. I thought it came from you--I didn't know who  else would be writing to her. A boy brought it and gave it to her at  the door. She's been acting strange ever since. She cries at  night--something Lynde never did before except when her mother died.  And in daytime she roams the shore and woods like one possessed. You  must find out what was in that letter, Mr. Douglas.\"    \"Have you any idea who the boy was?\" Alan asked, feeling somewhat  relieved. The mystery was clearing up, he thought. No doubt it was the  old story of some cowardly anonymous letter. His thoughts flew  involuntarily to Isabel King.    Emily shook her head.    \"No. He was just a half-grown fellow with reddish hair and he limped a  little.\"    \"Oh, that is the postmaster's son,\" said Alan disappointedly. \"That  puts us further off the scent than ever. The letter was probably  dropped in the box at the office and there will consequently be no way  of tracing the writer.\"    \"Well, I can't tell you anything more,\" said Emily. \"You'll have to  ask Lynde for the truth.\"    This Alan was determined to do whenever he should meet her. He did not  go to the house with Emily but wandered about the shore, watching for  Lynde and not seeing her.

Below was what in dry  weather--so, at least, I was told--was merely a pretty, grassy little  valley, but which was now a considerable creek of muddy yellow water,  rising daily. Beyond was a cheerless prospect of sodden prairie and  dripping \"bluff.\"    \"It would be a golden, mellow land, with purple hazes over the bluffs,  in a normal fall,\" assured Kate. \"Even now if the sun were just to  shine out for a day and a good 'chinook' blow you'd see a surprising  change. I feel like chanting continually that old rhyme I learned in  the first primer,        'Rain, rain, go away,      Come again some other day:      --some other day next summer--      Phil and Katie want to play.'    Philippa, dear girl, don't look so dismal. It's bound to clear up  sometime.\"    \"I wish the 'sometime' would come soon, then,\" I said, rather  grumpily.    \"You know it hasn't really rained for three days,\" protested Kate.  \"It's been damp and horrid and threatening, but it hasn't rained. I  defy you to say that it has actually rained.\"    \"When it's so wet underfoot that you can't stir out without rubber  boots it might as well be wet overhead too,\" I said, still grumpily.    \"I believe you're homesick, girl,\" said Kate anxiously.    \"No, I'm not,\" I answered, laughing, and feeling ashamed of my  ungraciousness. \"Nobody could be homesick with such a jolly good  fellow as you around, Kate. It's only that this weather is getting on  my nerves a bit. I'm fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils. If your  chinook doesn't come soon, Kitty, I'll do something quite desperate.\"    \"I feel that way myself,\" admitted Kate. \"Real reckless, Phil. Anyhow,  let's put on our despised rubber boots and sally out for a wade.\"    \"Here's Jim Nash coming on horseback down the trail,\" I said. \"Let's  wait and see if he's got the mail.\"    We hurried down, Kate humming, \"Somewhere the sun is shining,\" solely,  I believe, because she knew it aggravated me. At any other time I  should probably have thrown a pillow at her, but just now I was too  eager to see if Jim Nash had brought any mail.    I had come from Ontario, the first of September, to visit Uncle  Kenneth Morrison's family. I had been looking forward to the trip for  several years. My cousin Kate and I had always corresponded since they  had \"gone west\" ten years before; and Kate, who revelled in the  western life, had sung the praises of her adopted land rapturously and  constantly. It was quite a joke on her that, when I did finally come  to visit her, I should have struck the wettest autumn ever recorded in  the history of the west. A wet September in Saskatchewan is no joke,  however. The country was almost \"flooded out.\" The trails soon became  nearly impassable. All our plans for drives and picnics and  inter-neighbour visiting--at that time a neighbour meant a man who  lived at least six miles away--had to be given up. Yet I was not  lonesome, and I enjoyed my visit in spite of everything. Kate was a  host in herself. She was twenty-eight years old--eight years my  senior--but the difference in our ages had never been any barrier to  our friendship. She was a jolly, companionable, philosophical soul,  with a jest for every situation, and a merry solution for every  perplexity. The only fault I had to find with her was her tendency to  make parodies. Kate's parodies were perfectly awful and always got on  my nerves.    She was dreadfully ashamed of the way the Saskatchewan weather was  behaving after all her boasting. She was thin at the best of times,  but now she grew positively scraggy with the worry of it. I am afraid  I took an unholy delight in teasing her, and abused the western  weather even more than was necessary.    Jim Nash--the lank youth who was hired to look after the place during  Uncle Kenneth's absence on a prolonged threshing expedition--had  brought some mail. Kate's share was a letter, postmarked Bothwell, a  rising little town about one hundred and twenty miles from Arrow  Creek. Kate had several friends there, and one of our plans had been  to visit Bothwell and spend a week with them. We had meant to drive,  of course, since there was no other way of getting there, and equally  of course the plan had been abandoned because of the wet weather.    \"Mother,\" exclaimed Kate, \"Mary Taylor is going to be married in a  fortnight's time! She wants Phil and me to go up to Bothwell for the  wedding.\"    \"What a pity you can't go,\" remarked Aunt Jennie placidly. Aunt Jennie  was always a placid little soul, with a most enviable knack of taking  everything easy. Nothing ever worried her greatly, and when she had  decided that a thing was inevitable it did not worry her at all.    \"But I am going,\" cried Kate. \"I will go--I must go. I positively  cannot let Mary Taylor--my own beloved Molly--go and perpetrate  matrimony without my being on hand to see it. Yes, I'm going--and if  Phil has a spark of the old Blair pioneer spirit in her, she'll go  too.\"    \"Of course I'll go if you go,\" I said.    Aunt Jennie did not think we were in earnest, so she merely laughed at  first, and said, \"How do you propose to go? Fly--or swim?\"    \"We'll drive, as usual,\" said Kate calmly. \"I'd feel more at home in  that way of locomotion. We'll borrow Jim Nash's father's democrat, and  take the ponies. We'll put on old clothes, raincoats, rubber caps and  boots, and we'll start tomorrow. In an ordinary time we could easily  do it in six days or less, but this fall we'll probably need ten or  twelve.\"    \"You don't really mean to go, Kate!\" said Aunt Jennie, beginning to  perceive that Kate did mean it.    \"I do,\" said Kate, in a convincing tone.    Aunt Jennie felt a little worried--as much as she could feel worried  over anything--and she tried her best to dissuade Kate, although she  plainly did not have much hope of doing so, having had enough  experience with her determined daughter to realize that when Kate said  she was going to do a thing she did it. It was rather funny to listen  to the ensuing dialogue.    \"Kate, you can't do it. It's a crazy idea! The road is one hundred and  twenty miles long.\"    \"I've driven it twice, Mother.\"    \"Yes, but not in such a wet year. The trail is impassable in places.\"    \"Oh, there are always plenty of dry spots to be found if you only look  hard for them.\"    \"But you don't know where to look for them, and goodness knows what  you'll get into while you are looking.\"    \"We'll call at the M.P. barracks and get an Indian to guide us.  Indians always know the dry spots.\"    \"The stage driver has decided not to make another trip till the  October frosts set in.\"    \"But he always has such a heavy load. It will be quite different with  us, you must remember. We'll travel light--just our provisions and a  valise containing our wedding garments.\"    \"What will you do if you get mired twenty miles from a human being?\"    \"But we won't. I'm a good driver and I haven't nerves--but I have  nerve. Besides, you forget that we'll have an Indian guide with us.\"    \"There was a company of Hudson Bay freighters ambushed and killed  along that very trail by Blackfoot Indians in 1839,\" said Aunt Jennie  dolefully.    \"Fifty years ago! Their ghosts must have ceased to haunt it by this  time,\" said Kate flippantly.    \"Well, you'll get wet through and catch your deaths of cold,\"  protested Aunt Jennie.    \"No fear of it. We'll be cased in rubber. And we'll borrow a good  tight tent from the M.P.s. Besides, I'm sure it's not going to rain  much more. I know the signs.\"    \"At least wait for a day or two until you're sure that it has cleared  up,\" implored Aunt Jennie.    \"Which being interpreted means, 'Wait for a day or two, because then  your father may be home and he'll squelch your mad expedition,'\" said  Kate, with a sly glance at me. \"No, no, my mother, your wiles are in  vain. We'll hit the trail tomorrow at sunrise. So just be good,  darling, and help us pack up some provisions. I'll send Jim for his  father's democrat.\"    Aunt Jennie resigned herself to the inevitable and betook herself to  the pantry with the air of a woman who washes her hands of the  consequences. I flew upstairs to pack some finery. I was wild with  delight over the proposed outing. I did not realize what it actually  meant, and I had perfect confidence in Kate, who was an expert driver,  an experienced camper out, and an excellent manager. If I could have  seen what was ahead of us I would certainly not have been quite so  jubilant and reckless, but I would have gone all the same. I would not  miss the laughter-provoking memories of that trip out of my life for  anything. I have always been glad I went.           *       *       *       *       *    We left at sunrise the next morning; there was a sunrise that morning,  for a wonder. The sun came up in a pinky-saffron sky and promised us a  fine day. Aunt Jennie bade us goodbye and, estimable woman that she  was, did not trouble us with advice or forebodings.    Mr. Nash had sent over his \"democrat,\" a light wagon with springs; and  Kate's \"shaganappies,\" Tom and Jerry--native ponies, the toughest  horse flesh to be found in the world--were hitched to it. Kate and I  were properly accoutred for our trip and looked--but I try to forget  how we looked! The memory is not flattering.    We drove off in the gayest of spirits. Our difficulties began at the  start, for we had to drive a mile before we could find a place to ford  the creek. Beyond that, however, we had a passable trail for three  miles to the little outpost of the Mounted Police, where five or six  men were stationed on detachment duty.    \"Sergeant Baker is a friend of mine,\" said Kate. \"He'll be only too  glad to lend me all we require.\"    The sergeant was a friend of Kate's,"]]]
