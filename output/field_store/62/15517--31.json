His hand was raised, the eye of every little girl was  fixed on him and instantly, in their soft, shrill voices, they began the  verse of a hymn. The traveller glanced down the nave. Every boy was on  his feet, white ribbons hanging bravely from the right arm, the Crown of  Thorns correctly held in one white-gloved hand, a Crucifix fastened with  a bow of ribbon to the coat lapel. Every eye was on the young priest,  who also raised his hand. Then they sang, as the girls had sung, and  with a right lusty will. And then, under the guiding hands, both boys  and girls sang together. There was a silence when their voices died  away, and from the altar a deep voice slowly chanted \"Ite; missa est,\"  and the High Mass of the First Communion Day was over.    Outside, little country carts stood near the church, and fathers and  brothers in blue blouses were waiting for the little communicants who  had had so long and so exciting a morning. Walking about with the  crowds, the traveller saw an exterior whose facade was plainly  commonplace and whose bare lateral walls were patched, and crowded by  other walls. Finally he came upon the apse, the most interesting part of  the church's exterior; and he leaned against a cafe wall and looked  across the little square.    Externally, the apse of Saint-Veran has five sides, and each side seems  supported by a channelled column. The capitals of these columns are  carved with leaves or with leaves and grotesques; on them round arches  rest; and above is a narrow foliated cornice. In relieving contrast to  the artificial classicism of the Renaissance of the interior, the  feeling of this apse is quite truly ancient and pagan, and it is not  less unique nor less charming because it is placed against a plain,  uninteresting wall. The eye travelling upward, above the choir-dome,  meets the lantern with its rounded windows and pointed roof, and by its  side the high little bell-turret which completes a curious exterior; an  exterior which is interesting and even beautiful in detail, but  irregular and heterogeneous as a whole.    The Cathedral of Cavaillon is one of many possibilities. Although small  like those of its Provencal kindred, it has more dignity than Orange,  more simplicity of interior line than the present Avignon, and it is to  be regretted that it should have suffered no less from restoration than  from old age.    [Illustration: THE CATHEDRAL'S TOWER AND TURRET.--CAVAILLON.]      [Sidenote: Apt.]    Few of the Cathedral-churches of the Midi are without holy relics, but  none is more famous, more revered, and more authentic a place of  pilgrimage than the Basilica of Apt. It came about in this way, says  local history. When Martha, Lazarus, and the Holy Marys of the Gospels  landed in France, they brought with them the venerated body of Saint  Anne, the Virgin's Mother; and Lazarus, being a Bishop, kept the holy  relic at his episcopal seat of Marseilles. Persecutions arose, and  dangers innumerable; and for safety's sake the Bishop removed Saint  Anne's body to Apt and sealed it secretly in the wall. For centuries,  Christians met and prayed in the little church, unconscious of the  wonder-working relic hidden so near them; and it was only through a  miracle, in Charlemagne's time and some say in his presence, that the  holy body was discovered. This is the history which a sacristan recites  to curious pilgrims as he leads them to the sub-crypt.    The sub-crypt of Sainte-Anne, one of the earliest of Gallo-Roman  \"churches,\" is not more than a narrow aisle; its low vault seems to  press over the head; the air is damp and chill; and the one little  candle which the patient sacristan moves to this side and to that, shows  the plain, un-ornamented stone-work and the undoubted masonry of Roman  times. It was part of the Aqueduct which carried water to the Theatre in  Imperial days, and had become a chapel in the primitive Christian era.  At the end which is curved as a choir is a heavy stone, used as an  altar; and high in the wall is the niche where the body of the church's  patron lay buried for those hundreds of years. It is a gloomy, cell-like  place, most curious and most interesting; and as the traveller saw faith  in the earnest gaze of some of his fellow-visitors, and doubt in the  smiles of others, he wondered what ancient ceremonials, secret Masses,  or secret prayers had been said in this tiny chamber, and what rows of  phantom-like worshippers had filed in and out the dark corridor.    Directly above is the higher upper crypt of the church, a diminutive but  true choir, with its tiny altar and ambulatory,--a jewel of the  Romanesque, heavy and plain and beautifully proportioned, with columns  and vaulting in perfect miniature. This, from its absolute purity of  style, is the most interesting part of the church; and being a crypt, it  is also the most difficult to see. In vain the sacristan ran from side  to side with his little candle, in vain the traveller gazed and  peered,--the little church was full of shadows and mysteries, dark and  lost under the weight of the great choir above.    [Illustration: \"THE MAIN BODY OF THE CHURCH.\"--APT.]    Even the main body of the church, above ground, is dimly lighted by  small, rounded windows above the arches of the nave, and from the dome  of Saint Anne's Chapel. Doubtless, on Sundays after High Mass, when the  great doors are opened, the merry sun of Provence casts its cheerful  rays far up the nave. But this is a church which is the better for its  shadows. A Romanesque aisle of the IX or X century, built by that same  Bishop Alphant who had seen the construction of the little crypt church,  a central nave of the XI century, Romanesque in conception, and a north  aisle of poor Provencal Gothic make a large but inharmonious  interior. Restoration following restoration, chapels of the XVIII  century, new vaultings, debased and conglomerate Gothic, and spectacular  decorations of gilded wood have destroyed the architectural value and  real beauty of the Cathedral's interior. Yet in the dim light, which is  the light of its every-day life, the great height of the church and its  sombre massiveness are not without impressiveness.    The exterior dominates the city, but it is so hopelessly confused and  commonplace that its natural dignity is lost. The heavy arch which  supports the clock tower forms an arcade across a narrow street and  makes it picturesque without adding dignity to the church itself. The  walls are unmeaning, often hidden by buildings, and there is not a  portal worthy of description. There is the dome of Saint Anne's Chapel  with a huge statue of the Patron, and the lantern of the central dome  ending in a pointed roof; but each addition to the exterior seems only  an ignorant or a spiteful accentuation of the general architectural  confusion.    To the faithful Catholic, the interest of Sainte-Anne of Apt lies in its  wonderful and glorious relics. Here are the bodies of Saint Eleazer and  Sainte Delphine his wife, a couple so pious that every morning they  dressed a Statue of the Infant Jesus, and every night they undressed it  and laid it to rest in a cradle. There is also the rosary of Sainte  Delphine whose every bead contained a relic; and before the Revolution  there were other treasures innumerable. During many years Apt has been  the pilgrim-shrine of the Faithful, and great and small offerings of  many centuries have been laid before the miracle-working body of the  Virgin's sainted Mother.    [Illustration: THE VIRGIN AND SAINT ANNE. _By Benzoni._]    The most famous of those who came praying and bearing gifts was Anne of  Austria, whose petition for the gift of a son, an heir for France, was  granted in the birth of Louis XIV. In gratitude, the Queen enriched the  church by vestments wrought in thread of gold and many sacred ornaments;  and at length she commanded Mansart to replace the little chapel in  which she had prayed, by a larger and more sumptuous one, a somewhat  uninteresting structure in the showy style of the XVII century, which is  now the resting-place of Saint Anne. In this chapel is the most  beautiful of the church's treasures which, strange to say, is a piece of  modern sculpture given by the present \"Monseigneur of Avignon.\" It is  small, and badly placed on a marble altar of discordant toning, with a  draped curtain of red gilt-fringed velvet for its background. Yet in  spite of these inartistic surroundings it has lost none of its tender  charm. Seated, with a scroll on her knees, the aged mother is earnestly  teaching the young Virgin who stands close by her side. The slender old  hand with its raised forefinger emphasises the lesson, and the loving  expression of the wrinkled, ascetic face, the attentiveness of the  Virgin and her slim young figure, make a touching picture, and a  beautiful example of the power of the modern chisel. Yet faith in  shrines and miraculous power is not, in this XX century, as pure nor as  universal as in the days of the past; and Faith, in Provencal Apt which  possesses so large a part of the Saint's body, is not as simple, and  therefore not as strong as in Breton Auray which has but a part of her  finger. Republicanism in the south country is not too friendly to the  Church, kings and queens no longer come with prodigal gifts, and  Sainte-Anne of Apt has not the peasant strength of Sainte-Anne of Auray.  And in spite of the great feast-day of July, in spite of Aptoisian  pride, in spite of the devotion and prayers of faithful worshippers, the  Cathedral of Apt is a church of past rather than of present glories.      [Sidenote: Riez.]    Just as the church-bells were chiming the morning Angelus, and the warm  sun was rising on a day of the early fall, a traveller drove out of old  Manosque.

In fact such contrivances exist in so very many  hermaphrodite flowers by which an occasional cross may take place, that  I cannot avoid suspecting (with Mr Knight) that the reproductive action  requires, at _intervals_, the concurrence of distinct individuals{204}.  Most breeders of plants and animals are firmly convinced that benefit is  derived from an occasional cross, not with another race, but with  another family of the same race; and that, on the other hand, injurious  consequences follow from long-continued close interbreeding in the same  family. Of marine animals, many more, than was till lately believed,  have their sexes on separate individuals; and where they are  hermaphrodite, there seems very generally to be means through the water  of one individual occasionally impregnating another: if individual  animals can singly propagate themselves for perpetuity, it is  unaccountable that no terrestrial animal, where the means of observation  are more obvious, should be in this predicament of singly perpetuating  its kind. I conclude, then, that races of most animals and plants, when  unconfined in the same country, would tend to blend together.         {204} The so-called Knight-Darwin Law is often misunderstood. See       Goebel in _Darwin and Modern Science_, 1909, p. 419; also F.       Darwin, _Nature_, Oct. 27, 1898.      _Whether our domestic races have descended from one or more wild  stocks._    Several naturalists, of whom Pallas{205} regarding animals, and Humboldt  regarding certain plants, were the first, believe that the breeds of  many of our domestic animals such as of the horse, pig, dog, sheep,  pigeon, and poultry, and of our plants have descended from more than one  aboriginal form. They leave it doubtful, whether such forms are to be  considered wild races, or true species, whose offspring are fertile when  crossed _inter se_. The main arguments for this view consist, firstly,  of the great difference between such breeds, as the Race-and Cart-Horse,  or the Greyhound and Bull-dog, and of our ignorance of the steps or  stages through which these could have passed from a common parent; and  secondly that in the most ancient historical periods, breeds resembling  some of those at present most different, existed in different countries.  The wolves of N. America and of Siberia are thought to be different  species; and it has been remarked that the dogs belonging to the  savages in these two countries resemble the wolves of the same country;  and therefore that they have probably descended from two different wild  stocks. In the same manner, these naturalists believe that the horse of  Arabia and of Europe have probably descended from two wild stocks both  apparently now extinct. I do not think the assumed fertility of these  wild stocks any very great difficulty on this view; for although in  animals the offspring of most cross-bred species are infertile, it is  not always remembered that the experiment is very seldom fairly tried,  except when two near species _both_ breed freely (which does not readily  happen, as we shall hereafter see) when under the dominion of man.  Moreover in the case of the China{206} and common goose, the canary and  siskin, the hybrids breed freely; in other cases the offspring from  hybrids crossed with either pure parent are fertile, as is practically  taken advantage of with the yak and cow; as far as the analogy of plants  serves, it is impossible to deny that some species are quite fertile  _inter se_; but to this subject we shall recur.         {205} Pallas' theory is discussed in the _Origin_, Ed. i. pp. 253,       254, vi. p. 374.         {206} See Darwin's paper on the fertility of hybrids from the       common and Chinese goose in _Nature_, Jan. 1, 1880.    On the other hand, the upholders of the view that the several breeds of  dogs, horses, &c., &c., have descended each from one stock, may aver  that their view removes all _difficulty about fertility_, and that the  main argument from the high antiquity of different breeds, somewhat  similar to the present breeds, is worth little without knowing the date  of the domestication of such animals, which is far from being the case.  They may also with more weight aver that, knowing that organic beings  under domestication do vary in some degree, the argument from the great  difference between certain breeds is worth nothing, without we know the  limits of variation during a long course of time, which is far from the  case. They may argue that almost every county in England, and in many  districts of other countries, for instance in India, there are slightly  different breeds of the domestic animals; and that it is opposed to all  that we know of the distribution of wild animals to suppose that these  have descended from so many different wild races or species: if so, they  may argue, is it not probable that countries quite separate and exposed  to different climates would have breeds not slightly, but considerably,  different? Taking the most favourable case, on both sides, namely that  of the dog; they might urge that such breeds as the bull-dog and  turnspit have been reared by man, from the ascertained fact that  strictly analogous breeds (namely the Niata ox and Ancon sheep) in other  quadrupeds have thus originated. Again they may say, seeing what  training and careful selection has effected for the greyhound, and  seeing how absolutely unfit the Italian greyhound is to maintain itself  in a state of nature, is it not probable that at least all  greyhounds,--from the rough deerhound, the smooth Persian, the common  English, to the Italian,--have descended from one stock{207}? If so, is  it so improbable that the deerhound and long-legged shepherd dog have so  descended? If we admit this, and give up the bull-dog, we can hardly  dispute the probable common descent of the other breeds.         {207} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 19, vi. p. 22.    The evidence is so conjectural and balanced on both sides that at  present I conceive that no one can decide: for my own part, I lean to  the probability of most of our domestic animals having descended from  more than one wild stock; though from the arguments last advanced and  from reflecting on the slow though inevitable effect of different races  of mankind, under different circumstances, saving the lives of and  therefore selecting the individuals most useful to them, I cannot doubt  but that one class of naturalists have much overrated the probable  number of the aboriginal wild stocks. As far as we admit the difference  of our races <to be> due to the differences of their original stocks, so  much must we give up of the amount of variation produced under  domestication. But this appears to me unimportant, for we certainly know  in some few cases, for instance in the Dahlia, and potato, and rabbit,  that a great number of varieties have proceeded from one stock; and, in  many of our domestic races, we know that man, by slowly selecting and by  taking advantage of sudden sports, has considerably modified old races  and produced new ones. Whether we consider our races as the descendants  of one or several wild stocks, we are in far the greater number of cases  equally ignorant what these stocks were.      _Limits to Variation in degree and kind._    Man's power in making races deends, in the first instance, on the stock  on which he works being variable; but his labours are modified and  limited, as we have seen, by the direct effects of the external  conditions,--by the deficient or imperfect hereditariness of new  peculiarities,--and by the tendency to continual variation and  especially to reversion to ancestral forms. If the stock is not variable  under domestication, of course he can do nothing; and it appears that  species differ considerably in this tendency to variation, in the same  way as even sub-varieties from the same variety differ greatly in this  respect, and transmit to their offspring this difference in tendency.  Whether the absence of a tendency to vary is an unalterable quality in  certain species, or depends on some deficient condition of the  particular state of domestication to which they are exposed, there is no  evidence. When the organization is rendered variable, or plastic, as I  have expressed it, under domestication, different parts of the frame  vary more or less in different species: thus in the breeds of cattle it  has been remarked that the horns are the most constant or least variable  character, for these often remain constant, whilst the colour, size,  proportions of the body, tendency to fatten &c., vary; in sheep, I  believe, the horns are much more variable. As a general rule the less  important parts of the organization seem to vary most, but I think there  is sufficient evidence that every part occasionally varies in a slight  degree. Even when man has the primary requisite variability he is  necessarily checked by the health and life of the stock he is working  on: thus he has already made pigeons with such small beaks that they can  hardly eat and will not rear their own young; he has made families of  sheep with so strong a tendency to early maturity and to fatten, that in  certain pastures they cannot live from their extreme liability to  inflammation; he has made (_i.e._ selected) sub-varieties of plants with  a tendency to such early growth that they are frequently killed by the  spring frosts; he has made a breed of cows having calves with such large  hinder quarters that they are born with great difficulty, often to the  death of their mothers{208}; the breeders were compelled to remedy this  by the selection of a breeding stock with smaller hinder quarters; in  such a case, however, it is possible by long patience and great loss, a "]]]
