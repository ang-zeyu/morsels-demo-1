And that is why the latter was said to have taught the  Peruvian women the art of spinning and weaving. This is a mythological  conception suggested by likening the moonbeams to twisted threads, out  of which on fair clear nights the brilliant verdure in which the earth  is clad is spun.    But before going on to the gods who form the usual retinue of these two  official and imperial deities, I must speak of two great Peruvian gods  whose worship was likewise widely spread, but who nevertheless are not  attached to the solar family, or at least are only so attached by an  after-thought and by dint of harmonizing efforts which the Incas had  their motives of policy for favouring: I mean the two great deities,  _Viracocha_ and _Pachacamac_.    The myth of Viracocha is the first instance we shall cite of traces of a  certain civilization prior to the Incas, or at any rate of a belief  widely spread in some parts of Peru that civilization had not really  been, as the legend of the Incas would have it, the sole work of that  sacerdotal family. The name of Viracocha must be very ancient, for it  became a generic name to signify divine beings. It was given to Manco  Capac himself as a title of honour, and the Spaniards on their arrival  passed as _Viracochas_ in the eyes of the people. This name, according  to Spanish authorities, followed by Prescott,[77] signifies _Foam of the  sea_ or of the _lake_. This would make the deity a male Aphrodite. He  was represented with a long beard, and human victims were sacrificed to  him. At the same time, they said that he had neither flesh nor bone,  that he ran swiftly, and that he lowered mountains and lifted up  valleys. The following legend was told of him.[78]    There were men on the earth before the Sun appeared, and the temples of  Viracocha, for instance, on the shores of Lake Titicaca, are older than  the Sun. One day Viracocha rose out of the lake. He made the sun, the  moon, the stars, and prescribed their course for them. Then he made  stone statues, put life into them, and commanded them to go out of the  caverns in which he had made them and follow him to Cuzco. There he  summoned the inhabitants, and set a man over them called Allca Vica, who  was the common ancestor of the Incas. Then he departed and disappeared  in the water.    Evidently this myth belongs to a different body of tradition from that  of the Incas. When it says that the earth was peopled before the Sun  appeared, it is only a mythical way of asserting that there were men and  even cities in Peru before the establishment of Sun-worship by the  Incas. Now the latter claimed direct descent from the Sun, the supreme  god, and they would not have readily allowed that this supreme deity had  been made by another. One is rather tempted to find in this myth the  echo of the claims put forward with equal resignation and persistency by  a priesthood of Viracocha, that bowed its head before the supremacy  acquired by the solar priesthood, but insisted all the same upon the  fact that it was itself its elder brother.    But to what element can we affiliate the god Viracocha himself?    His aquatic name, _Foam of the sea_ or _lake_, in itself leads us to  suppose that he was closely related to the water. The supposition is  confirmed by the saying that he had neither flesh nor bone, and yet ran  swiftly. We can understand, too, why he lowers mountains and raises  valleys. He rises from the water and disappears in it. He is bearded,  like all aquatic gods, with their fringes of reeds. Finally, his consort  and sister Cocha is the lake itself, and also the goddess of rain. An  old Peruvian hymn that was chanted under the Incas, and has fortunately  been preserved, raises the character we have assigned to Viracocha  above all doubt.[79] The goddess Cocha is represented as carrying an urn  full of water and snow on her head. Her brother Viracocha breaks the  urn, that its contents may spread over the earth. Here is the hymn,  which is composed in nineteen short verses or lines:         1. Fair Princess,       3. Thy urn       2. Thy brother       4. Shatters.       5. At the blow       6. It thunders, lightens       7. Flashes;       8. But thou, Princess,      10. Rainest down       9. Thy waters.      11. At the same time      12. Hailest,      13. Snowest.      14. World-former,      15. World-animator,      16. Viracocha,      17. To this office      18. Thee has destined,      19. Consecrated.    It admits of no doubt, therefore, that Viracocha held a place in the  Peruvian Pantheon closely analogous to that of Tlaloc, the rain-god, in  its Mexican counterpart. The blow with which he breaks his sister's urn  is the thunder-stroke. Inasmuch as rain is a fertilizing agent,  Viracocha represents its generative force. His resemblance to Tlaloc  extends to his demand for human victims, in which he is less ferociously  insatiable, but quite as pronounced, as his Mexican analogue. Since his  legend makes him rise out of the Lake of Titicaca, we must think of him  as the chief god of the religion in honour before that of the Incas rose  to supremacy. When it is said that after accomplishing his task he  disappeared, we are reminded that the river Desaguadero, which carries  off the waters of Lake Titicaca, sinks into the earth and is lost to  sight.    But there was yet another great deity whose pretensions the Incas had  allowed by making room for him in the official religion, although he  really belonged to a totally different group of mythical formations: I  refer to Pachacamac, whose name signifies \"animator of the earth,\" from  _caman_, \"to animate,\" and _pacha_, \"earth.\"[80] The primitive centre of  his worship was in the valley of Lurin, south of Lima, as well as in  that valley of Rimac which has given its name to the city of Lima  itself, for the latter is but a transformation of _Rimac_. It was there  that Pachacamac's colossal temple rose. It was left standing by the  Incas, but is now in ruins.[81] The branch of the Yuncas who resided  there were already possessed of a certain civilization when the Inca  Pachacutec annexed their country, at the close of the fourteenth  century, partly by persuasion and partly by terror. Pachacamac was the  divine civilizer who had taught this people the arts and crafts.[82] It  would even seem that he had supplanted a still more ancient worship of  Viracocha in these same valleys, for it is said that the latter was  worsted in war by him and put to flight, upon which the new god renewed  the world by changing the people he found on the earth into jaguars and  monkeys, and creating a new and higher race. This opposition to  Viracocha, god of the waters, puts us on the traces of Pachacamac's  original significance. He must have been a god of fire, and especially  of the internal fire of the earth, which displays itself in the volcanos  and warms the spirit of man. He was a kind of Peruvian Dionysus. There  was something gloomy and violent about his worship. He demanded human  victims. The valley of Rimac really means the valley of the _Speaker_,  of him who answers when questioned. There was a kind of oracle inspired  by the god of internal fire there. A certain feeling of mystery, as  though in Pachacamac they had to do with a god less visible, less  palpable, more spiritual than the rest, seems to have impressed itself  upon his Peruvian worshippers. Garcilasso, who perhaps exaggerates a  little, here as elsewhere, goes near to making him a god who could only  be adored in the heart, without temple and without sacrifices.[83]    Thus, if the myth of Viracocha, god of the waters, makes the stars and  the earth rise out of the moist element which he has fertilized and  organized, the myth of Pachacamac makes him a kind of demiurge working  within to form the world and enlighten mankind. I need not stay to point  out what close analogies these two conceptions find in several of the  cosmogonies of the Old World.    This confusion and rivalry of the Peruvian gods has left its traces in  the crude and obscure legend of the Collas, or mountaineers of Pacari  Tambo, to the south-west of Cuzco. \"From the caves of Pacari Tambo (i.e.  'the house of the dawn') issued one day four brothers and four sisters.  The eldest ascended a mountain, and flung stones towards the four  cardinal points, which was his way of taking possession of all the land.  This aroused the displeasure of the other three. The youngest of all was  the cunningest, and he resolved to get rid of his three brothers and  reign alone. He persuaded his eldest brother to enter a cave, and as  soon as he had done so closed the mouth with an enormous stone, and  imprisoned him there for ever.\" This seems to refer to the  quasi-subterranean cultus of Pachacamac, the internal fire, the first  revelation of whom must have been a volcano hurling stones in every  direction.--\"The youngest brother then persuaded the second to ascend a  high mountain with him, to seek their lost brother, and when they stood  on the summit he hurled him down the precipice and changed him into a  stone by a spell.\" I cannot say to what special deity this part of the  legend alludes, unless it simply refers to an ancient worship of stones  or rocks, many vestiges of which remained under the Incas, though it  ceased to have any official importance in presence of the radiant  worship of the Sun promulgated and favoured by the ruling family.--\"Then  the third brother fled in terror.\" This fleeing god must be Viracocha,  the god of showers, who flees before the Sun.--\"Then the youngest  brother built Cuzco, caused himself to be adored as child of the Sun  under the name of Pirrhua Manco, and likewise built other cities on the  same model.\"[84]    This last trait puts it out of doubt that the legend is really an  attempt to explain how the religion of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34834"],[0,"A Text-Book of Astronomy (#20)"],[1,"anything from two hours downward.    [Illustration: FIG. 34.--Relation of the lunar nodes to eclipses.]    67. RELATION OF THE LUNAR NODES TO ECLIPSES.--To show why the moon  sometimes encounters the earth's shadow centrally and more frequently at  full moon passes by without touching it at all, we resort to Fig. 34,  which represents a part of the orbit of the earth about the sun, with  dates showing the time in each year at which the earth passes the part  of its orbit thus marked. The orbit of the moon about the earth, _M M´_,  is also shown, with the new moon, _M_, casting its shadow toward the  earth and the full moon, _M´_, apparently immersed in the earth's  shadow. But here appearances are deceptive, and the student who has  made the observations set forth in Chapter III has learned for himself  a fact of which careful account must now be taken. The apparent paths of  the moon and sun among the stars are great circles which lie near each  other, but are not exactly the same; and since these great circles are  only the intersections of the sky with the planes of the earth's orbit  and the moon's orbit, we see that these planes are slightly inclined to  each other and must therefore intersect along some line passing through  the center of the earth. This line, _N´ N´´_, is shown in the figure,  and if we suppose the surface of the paper to represent the plane of the  earth's orbit, we shall have to suppose the moon's orbit to be tipped  around this line, so that the left side of the orbit lies above and the  right side below the surface of the paper. But since the earth's shadow  lies in the plane of its orbit--i. e., in the surface of the paper--the  full moon of March, _M´_, must have passed below the shadow, and the new  moon, _M_, must have cast its shadow above the earth, so that neither a  lunar nor a solar eclipse could occur in that month. But toward the end  of May the earth and moon have reached a position where the line  _N´ N´´_ points almost directly toward the sun, in line with the shadow  cones which hide it. Note that the line _N´ N´´_ remains very nearly  parallel to its original position, while the earth is moving along its  orbit. The full moon will now be very near this line and therefore very  close to the plane of the earth's orbit, if not actually in it, and must  pass through the shadow of the earth and be eclipsed. So also the new  moon will cast its shadow in the plane of the ecliptic, and this shadow,  falling upon the earth, produced the total solar eclipse of May 28,  1900.    _N´ N´´_ is called the line of nodes of the moon's orbit (§ 39), and the  two positions of the earth in its orbit, diametrically opposite each  other, at which _N´ N´´_ points exactly toward the sun, we shall call  the _nodes_ of the lunar orbit. Strictly speaking, the nodes are those  points of the sky against which the moon's center is projected at the  moment when in its orbital motion it cuts through the plane of the  earth's orbit. Bearing in mind these definitions, we may condense much  of what precedes into the proposition: Eclipses of either sun or moon  can occur only when the earth is at or near one of the nodes of the  moon's orbit. Corresponding to these positions of the earth there are in  each year two seasons, about six months apart, at which times, and at  these only, eclipses can occur. Thus in the year 1900 the earth passed  these two points on June 2d and November 24th respectively, and the  following list of eclipses which occurred in that year shows that all of  them were within a few days of one or the other of these dates:            _Eclipses of the Year 1900_        Total solar eclipse          May 28th.      Partial lunar eclipse        June 12th.      Annular (solar) eclipse      November 21st.    68. ECLIPSE LIMITS.--If the earth is exactly at the node at the time of  new moon, the moon's shadow will fall centrally upon it and will produce  an eclipse visible within the torrid zone, since this is that part of  the earth's surface nearest the plane of its orbit. If the earth is near  but not at the node, the new moon will stand a little north or south of  the plane of the earth's orbit, and its shadow will strike the earth  farther north or south than before, producing an eclipse in the  temperate or frigid zones; or the shadow may even pass entirely above or  below the earth, producing no eclipse whatever, or at most a partial  eclipse visible near the north or south pole. Just how many days' motion  the earth may be away from the node and still permit an eclipse is shown  in the following brief table of eclipse limits, as they are called:                      _Solar Eclipse Limits_      If at any new moon the earth is      Less than 10 days away from a node, a central eclipse is certain.    Between 10 and 16 days   \"  \"  \"    some kind of eclipse is certain.    Between 16 and 19 days   \"  \"  \"    a partial eclipse is possible.    More than 19 days        \"  \"  \"    no eclipse is possible.                    _Lunar Eclipse Limits_      If at any full moon the earth is      Less than 4 days away from a node, a total eclipse is certain.    Between 4 and 10 days   \"  \"  \"    some kind of eclipse is certain.    Between 10 and 14 days  \"  \"  \"    a partial eclipse is possible.    More than 14 days       \"  \"  \"    no eclipse is possible.    From this table of eclipse limits we may draw some interesting  conclusions about the frequency with which eclipses occur.    69. NUMBER OF ECLIPSES IN A YEAR.--Whenever the earth passes a node of  the moon's orbit a new moon must occur at some time during the 2 × 16  days that the earth remains inside the limits where some kind of eclipse  is certain, and there must therefore be an eclipse of the sun every time  the earth passes a node of the moon's orbit. But, since there are two  nodes past which the earth moves at least once in each year, there must  be at least two solar eclipses every year. Can there be more than two?  On the average, will central or partial eclipses be the more numerous?    A similar line of reasoning will not hold true for eclipses of the moon,  since it is quite possible that no full moon should occur during the 20  days required by the earth to move past the node from the western to the  eastern limit. This omission of a full moon while the earth is within  the eclipse limits sometimes happens at both nodes in the same year, and  then we have a year with no eclipse of the moon. The student may note in  the list of eclipses for 1900 that the partial lunar eclipse of June  12th occurred 10 days after the earth passed the node, and was therefore  within the doubtful zone where eclipses may occur and may fail, and  corresponding to this position the eclipse was a very small one, only a  thousandth part of the moon's diameter dipping into the shadow of the  earth. By so much the year 1900 escaped being an illustration of a year  in which no lunar eclipse occurred.    A partial eclipse of the moon will usually occur about a fortnight  before or after a total eclipse of the sun, since the full moon will  then be within the eclipse limit at the opposite node. A partial eclipse  of the sun will always occur about a fortnight before or after a total  eclipse of the moon.    [Illustration: FIG. 35.--The eclipse of May 28, 1900.]    70. ECLIPSE MAPS.--It is the custom of astronomers to prepare, in  advance of the more important eclipses, maps showing the trace of the  moon's shadow across the earth, and indicating the times of beginning  and ending of the eclipses, as is shown in Fig. 35. While the actual  construction of such a map requires much technical knowledge, the  principles involved are simple enough: the straight line passed through  the center of sun and moon is the axis of the shadow cone, and the map  contains little more than a graphical representation of when and where  this cone meets the surface of the earth. Thus in the map, the \"Path of  Total Eclipse\" is the trace of the shadow cone across the face of the  earth, and the width of this path shows that the earth encountered the  shadow considerably inside the vertex of the cone. The general direction  of the path is from west to east, and the slight sinuousities which it  presents are for the most part due to unavoidable distortion of the  map caused by the attempt to represent the curved surface of the earth  upon the flat surface of the paper. On either side of the Path of Total  Eclipse is the region within which the eclipse was only partial, and the  broken lines marked Begins at 3h., Ends at 3h., show the intersection of  the penumbral cone with the surface of the earth at 3 P. M., Greenwich  time. These two lines inclose every part of the earth's surface from  which at that time any eclipse whatever could be seen, and at this  moment the partial eclipse was just beginning at every point on the  eastern edge of the penumbra and just ending at every point on the  western edge, while at the center of the penumbra, on the Path of Total  Eclipse, lay the shadow of the moon, an oval patch whose greatest  diameter was but little more than 60 miles in length, and within which  lay every part of the earth where the eclipse was total at that moment.    The position of the penumbra at other hours is also shown on the map,  although with more distortion, because it then meets the surface of the  earth more obliquely, and from these lines it is easy to obtain the time  of beginning and end of the eclipse at any desired place, and to  estimate by the distance of the place from the Path of Total Eclipse how  much of the sun's face was obscured.    Let the student make these \"predictions\" for Washington, Chicago,  London, and Algiers.    The points in the map marked First Contact, Last Contact, show the  places at which the penumbral cone first touched the earth and finally  left it.
