A husband,  therefore, is to lie only with his wife whom he hath married; but to  have to do with another man's wife is a wicked thing, which, if any one  ventures upon, death is inevitably his punishment: no more can he  avoid the same who forces a virgin betrothed to another man, or entices  another man's wife. The law, moreover, enjoins us to bring up all our  offspring, and forbids women to cause abortion of what is begotten, or  to destroy it afterward; and if any woman appears to have so done, she  will be a murderer of her child, by destroying a living creature,  and diminishing human kind; if any one, therefore, proceeds to such  fornication or murder, he cannot be clean. Moreover, the law enjoins,  that after the man and wife have lain together in a regular way, they  shall bathe themselves; for there is a defilement contracted thereby,  both in soul and body, as if they had gone into another country; for  indeed the soul, by being united to the body, is subject to miseries,  and is not freed therefrom again but by death; on which account the law  requires this purification to be entirely performed.    26. Nay, indeed, the law does not permit us to make festivals at the  births of our children, and thereby afford occasion of drinking to  excess; but it ordains that the very beginning of our education should  be immediately directed to sobriety. It also commands us to bring those  children up in learning, and to exercise them in the laws, and make  them acquainted with the acts of their predecessors, in order to their  imitation of them, and that they might be nourished up in the laws from  their infancy, and might neither transgress them, nor have any pretense  for their ignorance of them.    27. Our law hath also taken care of the decent burial of the dead, but  without any extravagant expenses for their funerals, and without the  erection of any illustrious monuments for them; but hath ordered that  their nearest relations should perform their obsequies; and hath showed  it to be regular, that all who pass by when any one is buried should  accompany the funeral, and join in the lamentation. It also ordains that  the house and its inhabitants should be purified after the funeral is  over, that every one may thence learn to keep at a great distance from  the thoughts of being pure, if he hath been once guilty of murder.    28. The law ordains also, that parents should be honored immediately  after God himself, and delivers that son who does not requite them for  the benefits he hath received from them, but is deficient on any such  occasion, to be stoned. It also says that the young men should pay due  respect to every elder, since God is the eldest of all beings. It does  not give leave to conceal any thing from our friends, because that is  not true friendship which will not commit all things to their fidelity:  it also forbids the revelation of secrets, even though an enmity arise  between them. If any judge takes bribes, his punishment is death: he  that overlooks one that offers him a petition, and this when he is able  to relieve him, he is a guilty person. What is not by any one intrusted  to another ought not to be required back again. No one is to touch  another's goods. He that lends money must not demand usury for its loan.  These, and many more of the like sort, are the rules that unite us in  the bands of society one with another.    29. It will be also worth our while to see what equity our legislator  would have us exercise in our intercourse with strangers; for it will  thence appear that he made the best provision he possibly could, both  that we should not dissolve our own constitution, nor show any  envious mind towards those that would cultivate a friendship with us.  Accordingly, our legislator admits all those that have a mind to observe  our laws so to do; and this after a friendly manner, as esteeming that  a true union which not only extends to our own stock, but to those that  would live after the same manner with us; yet does he not allow those  that come to us by accident only to be admitted into communion with us.    30. However, there are other things which our legislator ordained for us  beforehand, which of necessity we ought to do in common to all men; as  to afford fire, and water, and food to such as want it; to show them  the roads; not to let any one lie unburied. He also would have us treat  those that are esteemed our enemies with moderation; for he doth not  allow us to set their country on fire, nor permit us to cut down those  trees that bear fruit; nay, further, he forbids us to spoil those that  have been slain in war. He hath also provided for such as are taken  captive, that they may not be injured, and especially that the women  may not be abused. Indeed he hath taught us gentleness and humanity  so effectually, that he hath not despised the care of brute beasts,  by permitting no other than a regular use of them, and forbidding any  other; and if any of them come to our houses, like supplicants, we are  forbidden to slay them; nor may we kill the dams, together with their  young ones; but we are obliged, even in an enemy's country, to spare and  not kill those creatures that labor for mankind. Thus hath our lawgiver  contrived to teach us an equitable conduct every way, by using us  to such laws as instruct us therein; while at the same time he hath  ordained that such as break these laws should be punished, without the  allowance of any excuse whatsoever.    31. Now the greatest part of offenses with us are capital; as if any  one be guilty of adultery; if any one force a virgin; if any one be so  impudent as to attempt sodomy with a male; or if, upon another's making  an attempt upon him, he submits to be so used. There is also a law for  slaves of the like nature, that can never be avoided. Moreover, if any  one cheats another in measures or weights, or makes a knavish bargain  and sale, in order to cheat another; if any one steals what belongs to  another, and takes what he never deposited; all these have punishments  allotted them; not such as are met with among other nations, but more  severe ones. And as for attempts of unjust behavior towards parents, or  for impiety against God, though they be not actually accomplished, the  offenders are destroyed immediately. However, the reward for such as  live exactly according to the laws is not silver or gold; it is not a  garland of olive branches or of small age, nor any such public sign of  commendation; but every good man hath his own conscience bearing witness  to himself, and by virtue of our legislator's prophetic spirit, and of  the firm security God himself affords such a one, he believes that God  hath made this grant to those that observe these laws, even though they  be obliged readily to die for them, that they shall come into being  again, and at a certain revolution of things shall receive a better life  than they had enjoyed before. Nor would I venture to write thus at this  time, were it not well known to all by our actions that many of our  people have many a time bravely resolved to endure any sufferings,  rather than speak one word against our law.    32. Nay, indeed, in case it had so fallen out, that our nation had not  been so thoroughly known among all men as they are, and our voluntary  submission to our laws had not been so open and manifest as it is, but  that somebody had pretended to have written these laws himself, and had  read them to the Greeks, or had pretended that he had met with men out  of the limits of the known world, that had such reverent notions of God,  and had continued a long time in the firm observance of such laws  as ours, I cannot but suppose that all men would admire them on a  reflection upon the frequent changes they had therein been themselves  subject to; and this while those that have attempted to write somewhat  of the same kind for politic government, and for laws, are accused  as composing monstrous things, and are said to have undertaken an  impossible task upon them. And here I will say nothing of those other  philosophers who have undertaken any thing of this nature in their  writings. But even Plato himself, who is so admired by the Greeks on  account of that gravity in his manners, and force in his words, and that  ability he had to persuade men beyond all other philosophers, is little  better than laughed at and exposed to ridicule on that account, by those  that pretend to sagacity in political affairs; although he that shall  diligently peruse his writings will find his precepts to be somewhat  gentle, and pretty near to the customs of the generality of mankind.  Nay, Plato himself confesseth that it is not safe to publish the true  notion concerning God among the ignorant multitude. Yet do some men look  upon Plato's discourses as no better than certain idle words set off  with great artifice. However, they admire Lycurgus as the principal  lawgiver, and all men celebrate Sparta for having continued in the firm  observance of his laws for a very long time. So far then we have gained,  that it is to be confessed a mark of virtue to submit to laws. [24] But  then let such as admire this in the Lacedemonians compare that duration  of theirs with more than two thousand years which our political  government hath continued; and let them further consider, that though  the Lacedemonians did seem to observe their laws exactly while they  enjoyed their liberty, yet that when they underwent a change of their  fortune,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28491"],[0,"Dishes & Beverages of the Old South (#20)"],[1,"so it  shall not scorch. It must be tender throughout but not mushy-soft.    _Cauliflower Pickle_: Drop two heads cauliflower in salted boiling  water, cook fifteen minutes, take up, drop in cold water, separate into  neat florets, and pack down in a clean crock. Pour upon the florets,  hot, a quart of vinegar, seasoned with a mixture of two tablespoonfuls  salad oil, teaspoonful dry mustard, tablespoonful sugar, teaspoonful  salt, half-teaspoonful onion juice, half-teaspoonful black pepper, dash  of paprika, ten drops tabasco. Bring all to a boil, and pour over the  pickle, first strewing well through it blade mace, whole cloves, alspice  and cinnamon, broken small but not powdered.    _Pear Relish_: Wash and stem a gallon of sound ripe, but not mellow  Seckel pears, remove the blossoms with a very sharp narrow pen-knife,  and stick a clove in each cut. Drain, and drop into a syrup, made of  three pounds of sugar and a quart of vinegar. Bring to a quick boil,  skim, and set back to simmer. Add after skimming, cloves, alspice, mace,  ginger, cinnamon, and black pepper, pounded small but not powdered. Cut  up a large sweet red pepper, and drop in the shreds. Let cook till the  pears are tender. If the syrup is thin, add more sugar--some pears yield  more juice than others. Sliced lemon gives a piquant tang, but is  optional. Put in glass or stone jars, and cover tight, laying a brandy  paper on top.    _Cherries Piquant_: Wash well, and stem but do not pit, half a gallon  ripe Morello cherries. Drain well, strew spices well through them, lay  thin sliced lemon on top, add a dozen whole pepper corns, and a tiny pod  of Cayenne pepper, then pour over a pint of sharp vinegar, boiled with  four pounds of sugar, and skimmed clean. Let stand all night, drain off  syrup in the morning, boil up, skim, and pour again over the fruit. Next  day, put all in a kettle, and cook for fifteen minutes, then put in  glass jars, seal and keep dark. Especially good with game or any meat  highly seasoned.    _Gooseberry Jam Spiced_: Wash, and nub half a gallon of green  gooseberries, picked just before they ripen. Put them in a kettle with  six large cups of sugar, a cup of water, half a teaspoonful each of  cloves, alspice, mace, grated nutmeg, and cinnamon, the grated yellow  peel of an orange and the strained juice. Cook slowly until thick--it  should jelly when dropped on a plate. Pack in small jars. One of the  very finest accompaniments to any sort of fowl. By leaving out the  spices, and merely cooking the berries thick enough to cut like cheese,  it is as fine as _bar le duc_ for serving with salad.    _Frozen Cranberry Sauce_: (Mrs. R. Heim.) Gives a new tang to game,  roast turkey, capon or duck. Cook a quart of cranberries until very soft  in one pint water, strain through coarse sieve, getting all the pulp,  add to it one and a half pints sugar, the juice--strained--of four  lemons, one quart boiling water, bring to a boil, skim clean, let cool,  and freeze rather soft.    \"_Apple Sauce Gone To Heaven_\": Thus a poet names it, though I, the  architect thereof, insist that it is wholly and beautifully mundane. To  make it, pare eight firm apples, the higher-flavored the better, core,  drop into cold water, as pared, let stand till you make the syrup. Take  a cup of sugar to each two apples and a cup of water to each two cups of  sugar. Bring to a boil, skim, clean twice, then throw in half a dozen  blades of mace, bits of thin yellow peel from two lemons, a few bits of  stick cinnamon, and one pepper corn--no more. Stick four cloves in each  apple, drop them in the syrup, which must be on the bubbling boil. After  the apples are in--they should just cover the pan, add the strained  juice of two lemons. Boil hard for five minutes, turn over the apples,  simmer till done--they will look clear all through. Skim out with a  perforated ladle, letting all syrup drain away from them, arrange in a  deepish glass dish, or pile on a glass platter. Boil the syrup until it  jellies when dropped on a plate, then dip it by spoonfuls over the  apples, letting it harden as it is dipped.    Another way, and easier, is to wash and core the apples, without  peeling, stick in the cloves, put in an earthen or agate baking dish,  add the sugar, water, spices, cover close, and set in a hot oven. Cook  until the apples are soft through, then uncover, and crisp a little on  top. The peel will be edible, and the flavor richer than when boiled,  but the dish is not so decorative.    _Spiced Grapes_: Wash and drain sound full-ripe grapes, pick from the  stems, then pop out the grapes singly from the hulls. Save the hulls and  juice. Put the pulp and seeds over the fire, cook until soft, strain  through a colander to remove the seed, then add the pulp to the hulls  and juice, put all over the fire, with equal weight of sugar, and spices  to taste. I like cloves, alspice, mace and cinnamon, all pounded small,  but not powdered. Cook until thick, take care not to burn, put into  glasses like jelly, and serve with any sort of meat, or as a sweet.    Wild grapes washed, picked from stems, stewed and passed through a  colander, furnish a pulp that is worth sugar, spices and so on. Cook as  directed for vineyard grapes. By leaving out the most part of spices,  and putting in vinegar, a cupful to the quart of syrup, the result is a  very piquant jelly, or more properly, fruit cheese.    _Sweet-Sour Pears_: The pears must be ripe, but very firm. If large,  pare and quarter, cutting out the core, stick a clove in each quarter,  and drop as pared in cold ginger tea. If small or medium, wash instead  of paring, take out cores, stick two cloves in each cavity, pack close  in the kettle and cover when all are in with strained ginger tea. Boil  in the tea fifteen minutes, until a fork will pierce without too much  exertion. Skim out then, pack in jars, strewing spices liberally  through, then cover with vinegar boiling hot, to which you had added a  cupful of sugar for each quart. Let stand twenty-four hours, drain off,  boil, and pour over again. Do this three times, then put all in the  kettle, bring to a boil, cook five minutes, and put while hot in clean  stone jars.    _Spiced Plums_: All manner of plums, even the red wild fruit, make the  finest sort of relishes when cooked properly. Wash, pick, and weigh,  take four pounds of sugar to five of fruit, with what spices you choose,  never forgetting a tiny pod of Cayenne pepper, put all over the fire,  let boil slowly, skimming off froth. Stir with a perforated skimmer--it  will take out the most part of stones. A few stones left in give a fine  bitter almond flavor after the plums have stood a while. Take care not  to scorch, cook until very thick, then add strong vinegar, a cupful to  the half-gallon of fruit. Boil three minutes longer, put hot into  well-scalded jars, lay brandy paper over, or seal with paraffin.    _Baked Peaches_: Especially fine with barbecued lamb or roast duck or  smothered chicken. Peel one dozen large, ripe, juicy peaches, stick two  cloves in each, set in an agate or earthen pan they will just fill, add  two cups sugar, a tablespoonful butter, a very little water, and a good  strewing of mace and lemon peel. Cover close, and bake until done. Serve  hot. Instead of butter, a gill of whiskey may be used, putting it in  just before the peaches are taken up, and letting them stand covered  until the spirit goes through them. So prepared, they are better cold  than warm. The pits flavor the fruit so delicately they should never be  removed.          [Illustration: _Vegetables, Fruit Desserts, Sandwiches_]      _Tomato Layer_: Peel and slice a dozen meaty tomatoes, slice thin six  mild onions, cut the corn from half a dozen large ears, saving the milk.  Cover an earthen baking dish with a layer of tomatoes, season well with  salt and pepper, also the least suspicion of sugar. Lay onion slices  over, sprinkle lightly with salt, then add a layer of corn, seasoning it  with salt and a little sugar. Repeat till the dish is full. Pour over  the corn milk, the tomato juice, and a heaping tablespoonful of melted  butter. Bake in a hot oven half an hour, covering it for twenty  minutes, then browning uncovered. When corn is not in season, very crisp  brown bread crumbs may take its place. But it should be against the law  to put soft crumbs or any sort of bread uncrisped, into cooked tomatoes.  A green pepper shredded and mixed through the layers adds to the  flavor--for the devotees of green peppers.    _Corn Pudding_: Slit lengthwise the grains in eight large ears of corn,  scrape out the pulp carefully, saving all milk that runs. The corn  should be full, but not the least hard--if it has reached the dough  state, the grains will keep shape. Beat three eggs very light, with half  a teaspoonful salt, a tablespoonful sugar, plenty of black pepper, and  paprika, half a cup of very soft butter, and half a cup sweet cream. Add  the corn pulp and milk, stir well together--if too thick, thin with a  little milk. Pour into a pudding dish, cover and bake ten minutes, then  uncover, and bake until done.    _Fried Corn_: Fry crisp, half-pound streaky bacon, take up, and put into  the fat, bubbling hot, eight large ears of corn cut from the cob, and  seasoned with salt and black pepper. Add also the corn-milk, stir well  together for five minutes, then put an asbestos mat under the skillet  and let stand till the corn forms a thick brown crust over the bottom.  Pour out, loosen this crust with a knife, lay on top the corn, lay on  also the crisp bacon, and serve very hot. A famous breakfast dish down  south all through \"Roas'in' ear time.\" That is to say, from July to  October.    _Hulled Corn_: Known otherwise as lye hominy, and samp. Put a pint of  clean strong wood ashes into half a gallon of water, boil twenty  minutes--or until the water feels slippery. Let settle, drain off the  clear lye,"]]]
