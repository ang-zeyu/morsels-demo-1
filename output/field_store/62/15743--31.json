(#20)"],[1," exception of the Crinoids, the anatomy of which is,  however, so imperfectly understood, that we are hardly justified in  assuming that it does not exist even in that order. This organ is  known as the madreporic body; it is a small sieve or limestone filter  opening into a tube or canal; by means of this tube, which connects  with the ambulacral system, the water from without, first filtered  through the madreporic body and thus freed from any impurities, is  conveyed to the ambulacra. In the more detailed account of the  different orders we shall see what is the position of this singular  organ in each group, and how it is adapted in them all to their  special structure. The development of Echinoderms forms one of the  most wonderful chapters in the annals of Natural History. Marvellous  as is the embryonic history of the Acalephs, including all the  different aspects they assume in the cycle of their growth, it is  thrown into the shade by the transformations which Echinoderms undergo  before assuming their adult condition. This singular mode of  development, although it has features recalling the development of  Jelly-fishes from Hydroids, is nevertheless entirely distinct from it,  and is known only in the class of Echinoderms. As the whole story is  given at length in the chapter on the embryology of the Echinoderms,  we need only allude to it here in general terms. We owe the discovery  of this remarkable process to Johannes Mueller, one of the greatest  anatomists of this century.           *       *       *       *       *          HOLOTHURIANS.      _Synapta_. (_Synapta tenuis_ AYRES.)        [Illustration: Fig. 124. Synapta, natural size.]    This is one of the most curious of the Holothurians, and easily  observed on account of its transparency, which allows us to see its  internal structure. It has a long cylindrical body (Fig. 124) along  the length of which run the five rows of ambulacra, which are in this  instance closed tubes without any projecting suckers or locomotive  organs of any kind attached to them, so that the name is retained only  on account of their correspondence in position, and not from any  similarity of function to the ambulacra in Star-fishes and  Sea-urchins. But though the ambulacra in Synapta are in fact mere  water-tubes like the vertical tubes in the Ctenophorae, by means of  which the water, first filtered through the madreporic body,  circulates along the skin, they are as organs perfectly homologous  with the ambulacra in all other Echinoderms. The mouth has a circular  tube around the aperture, and a wreath of branching tentacles  encircling it. The habits of these animals are singular. They live in  very coarse mud, but they surround themselves with a thin envelope of  finer sand, which they form by selecting the small particles with  their tentacles, and making a ring around their anterior extremity.  This ring they then push down along the length of the body, and  continue this process, adding ring after ring, till they have entirely  encircled themselves with a sand tube. They move the rings down partly  by means of contractions of the body, but also by the aid of  innumerable appendages over the whole surface. To the naked eye these  appendages appear like little specks on the skin; but under the  microscope they are seen to be warts projecting from the surface, each  one containing a little anchor with the arms turned upward (Fig. 125).  Around the mouth these warts are larger, but do not contain any  anchors. It will be seen hereafter that these appendages are  homologous with certain organs in other Holothurians, the warts with  the anchors corresponding to the limestone pavement covering or  partially covering the surface of the Cuvieria, for instance, while  those without anchors correspond to the so-called false ambulacra in  Pentacta. By means of these appendages, though aided also by the  contractions of the body, the Synaptae move through the mud and collect  around themselves the sand tube in which they are encased. Their food  is very coarse for animals so delicate in structure. When completely  empty of food they are white, perfectly transparent, and the spiral  tube forming the digestive cavity may be seen wound up and hanging  loosely in the centre for the whole length of the body. In such a  condition it is of a pale yellow color. But look at one that is gorged  with food. The whole length of the alimentary canal is then crowded  with sand, pebbles, and shells, distinctly seen through the  transparent skin, and giving a dark gray color to the whole body. They  swallow the sand for the sake of the nutritious substance it contains,  and having assimilated and digested this, they then eject the harder  materials. The motion of the body in consequence of its contractions  is much like that of leeches, and on this account these Synaptae were  long supposed to be a transition type between the Radiates and worms.  The body grows to a great length, often half a yard and more, but  constantly drops large portions from its posterior part, by means of  its own contractions, or breaks itself up by the expulsion of the  intestines, which are very readily cast out. The tentacles are hollow,  consisting of a central rib with branches from either side. In the  Synaptae, as in all the Holothurians, the madreporic body is placed  near the mouth, between two of the ambulacra, and opposite the fifth  or odd one. The tube, connecting with the central tube around the  mouth, by means of which it communicates with the ambulacral tubes, is  very short.        [Illustration: Fig. 125. Anchor of Synapta; _a_ anchor, _w_ plate      upon which anchor is attached; greatly magnified.]      _Caudina_. (_Caudina arenata_ STIMPS.)        [Illustration: Fig. 126. Caudina arenata; natural size.]    Several other Holothurians are frequently met with on our shores.  Among them is the _Caudina arenata_ (Fig. 126), a small Holothurian,  yellowish in color, and thick in texture, by no means so pretty as the  white transparent Synapta; the tentacles are short, resembling a crown  of cloves around the mouth. It lives in the sand, and may be found in  great numbers on the sandy beaches after a storm.      _Cuvieria_. (_Cuvieria squamata_ D. & K.)        [Illustration: Fig. 127. Cuvieria; natural size.]    The Holothurian of our coast, excelling all the rest in beauty, is the  Cuvieria. (Fig. 127.) As it lies on the sand, a solid red lump, with  neither grace of form nor beauty of color, even the vividness of its  tint growing dull and dead when it is removed from its native element,  certainly no one could suspect that it possessed any hidden charm; but  place it in a glass bowl with fresh sea-water; the dull red changes to  deep vivid crimson, the tentacles creep out (Fig. 127) softly, and  slowly, till the mouth is surrounded by a spreading wreath, comparable  for richness of tint, and for delicate tracery, to the most beautiful  sea-weeds. These tentacles, when fully expanded, are as long as the  body itself. A limestone pavement composed of numerous pieces covers  almost the whole surface of the animal; this apparatus corresponds, as  we have already mentioned, to the warts containing anchors in the  Synapta; but in the latter, the limestone particles are smaller,  whereas in the Cuvieria they are developed to a remarkable extent.  This animal is very sluggish, the ambulacral suckers, found only on  three of the tubes, being arranged in such a way as to form a sort of  sole on which they creep; the sole is tough and leathery in texture,  but free from the limestone pavement described above. The young (Figs.  128, 129) are very common, swimming freely about, and more readily  found than the adult; they are of a bright vermilion color, but the  tentacles hardly branch at that age, nor is the limestone pavement  formed, which gives such a peculiar aspect to the full-grown animal.  The young Cuvieria, somewhat older than that represented in Fig. 129,  are found in plenty under stones at low-water mark, just after they  have given up their nomadic habits, and when the limestone pavement  begins to be developed.        [Illustration: Fig. 128. Young Cuvieria, much enlarged; _l_ body,      _g_ tentacles.]        [Illustration: Fig. 129. Somewhat older Cuvieria; _l_ body, _g_      tentacle round mouth, _g'_ testaete of sole, _b_ madreporic      tentacle.]      _Pentacta_. (_Pentacta frondosa_ JAeG.)    The highest of our Holothurians in structure, is the Pentacta. (Fig.  130) It is very rare on our beaches, though occasionally found under  stones at low-water mark; farther north, in Maine, and at Grand Manan,  it is very common, covering all the rocks near low-water mark. It is a  chocolate brown in color, and measures, when fully expanded, some  fifteen to eighteen inches in length. Unlike the Cuvieria, the  ambulacral suckers are evenly distributed and almost equally developed  on all the tubes; between the five rows of ambulacral suckers are  scattered irregularly certain appendages resembling suckers, but found  on examination not to be true locomotive suckers, and called on that  account false ambulacra. These are the organs corresponding to the  warts around the mouth of the Synapta. Although the ambulacral suckers  are, as we have said, equally developed on all the tubes, yet the  Pentacta does not use them indiscriminately as locomotive organs. In  Pentacta, as well as in all Holothurians, whether provided with  ambulacral suckers, or, like the Synapta and Caudina, deprived of  them, the odd ambulacrum, viz. the one placed opposite the madreporic  body, is always used to creep upon, and forms the under surface of the  animal.        [Illustration: Fig. 130.

It is wholly beyond our purpose to classify or describe the hybrid  offspring resulting from the unnatural union of pagan philosophy and  Christian truth; nor shall we attempt to follow in detail the  dissensions and quarrels on theological points and questions of  doctrine. Our purpose is achieved when by statement of fact and  citation of authority, the reality of the apostasy is established. We  shall consider therefore only the most important of the dissensions by  which the Church was troubled.--(See Note 4, end of chapter.)    15. About the middle of the third century, Sibellius, a presbyter or  bishop of the church in Africa, strongly advocated the doctrine of  \"trinity in unity\" as characterizing the Godhead. He claimed that the  divine nature of Christ was no distinct nor personal attribute of the  man Jesus, but merely a portion of the divine energy, an emanation  from the Father, with which the Son was temporarily endowed; and that  in like manner the Holy Ghost was a part of the divine Father. These  views were as vigorously opposed by some as defended by others, and  the disagreement was rife when Constantine so suddenly changed the  status of the Church, and brought to its support the power of the  state. Early in the fourth century the dispute assumed a threatening  aspect in a bitter contention between Alexander, bishop of Alexandria,  and Arius, one of the subordinate officers of the same church.  Alexander proclaimed that the Son was in all respects the equal of the  Father, and also of the same substance or essence. Arius insisted that  the Son had been created by the Father, and therefore could not be  co-eternal with His divine Parent; that the Son was the agent through  whom the will of the Father was executed, and that for this reason  also the Son was inferior to the Father both in nature and dignity. In  like manner the Holy Ghost was inferior to the other members of the  Godhead.    16. Arianism, as the doctrine came to be known, was preached with  vigor and denounced with energy; and the dissension thus occasioned  threatened to rend the Church to its foundation. At last the emperor,  Constantine, was forced to intervene in an effort to establish peace  among his contending churchmen. He summoned a council of church  dignitaries which assembled in the year 325, and which is known from  its place of session as the Council of Nice. This council condemned  the doctrine of Arius, and pronounced sentence of banishment against  its author. What was declared to be the orthodox doctrine of the  universal or Catholic church respecting the Godhead was promulgated as  follows:    17. \"We believe in one God, the Father, Almighty, the maker of all  things visible and invisible; and in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the Son  of God, begotten of the Father, only begotten, (that is) of the  substance of the Father; God of God, Light of Light; Very God of Very  God; begotten not made; of the same substance with the Father, by whom  all things were made, that are in heaven and that are in earth: who  for us men, and for our salvation, descended and was incarnate, and  became man; suffered and rose again the third day, ascended into the  heavens and will come to judge the living and the dead; and in the  Holy Spirit. But those who say there was a time when he [the Son] was  not, and that he was not before he was begotten, and that he was made  out of nothing, or affirm that he is of any other substance or  essence, or that the Son of God was created, and mutable, or  changeable, the Catholic Church doth pronounce accursed.\"    18. This is the generally accepted version of the Nicene Creed as  originally promulgated. In form it was somewhat modified, though left  practically unchanged as to essentials, by the council held at  Constantinople half a century later. What is regarded as a restatement  of the Nicene Creed has been attributed to Athanasius, one of the  chief opponents of Arianism, though his right to be considered the  author is questioned by many and emphatically denied by some  authorities on ecclesiastical history. Nevertheless, the statement  referred to has found a place in literature as the \"Creed of  Athanasius,\" and whether rightly or wrongly named it persists as a  declaration of belief professed by some Christian sects today. It has  a present place in the prescribed ritual of the Church of England. The  \"Creed of Athanasius\" reads as follows:    19. \"We worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity, neither  confounding the persons, nor dividing the substance. For there is one  person of the Father, another of the Son, and another of the Holy  Ghost. But the Godhead of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, is all one:  the glory equal, the majesty co-eternal. Such as the Father is, such  is the Son; and such is the Holy Ghost. The Father uncreate, the Son  uncreate and the Holy Ghost uncreate. The Father incomprehensible, the  Son incomprehensible and the Holy Ghost incomprehensible. The Father  eternal, the Son eternal, the Holy Ghost eternal. And yet there are  not three eternals; but one eternal. As also there are not three  incomprehensibles, nor three uncreated; but one uncreated, and one  incomprehensible. So likewise the Father is Almighty, the Son  Almighty, and the Holy Ghost Almighty; and yet there are not three  Almighties, but one Almighty. So the Father is God, the Son is God,  and the Holy Ghost is God, and yet they are not three Gods but one  God.\"    20. The Council of Nice is known in ecclesiastical history as one of  the most famous and important gatherings ever assembled as an official  body concerned with church administration. Not only was the Arian  dispute disposed of, so far as ecclesiastical decree could dispose of  a question vitally affecting the individual conscience, but many other  subjects of controversy were similarly quieted for the time. Thus the  long-standing dispute as to the time of celebrating Easter was settled  by vote, as was also the question agitated by Novatus and his  followers--as to the propriety of re-admitting repentant apostates to  the Church; and the schism caused by Meletius, a bishop of Upper  Africa, who had refused to recognize the superior authority of the  bishop of Alexandria. From the number and diversity of the questions  brought before the Nicene Council for adjudication, we may safely  conclude that the newly enthroned Church was not characterized by  unity of purpose nor harmony of action. However, compared with the  bitter contentions that follow, the dissensions in the reign of  Constantine were but as the beginnings of trouble.    21. The moral effect of the potent spirit of apostasy operating  through the first three centuries of the Church's existence and  nourished by the contributions of heathen philosophy, proved, as was  inevitable, highly injurious and evil. Some of the most pernicious of  these effects it becomes our duty to consider.    22. _Perverted Views of Life_. One of the heresies of early origin and  rapid growth in the Church was the doctrine of antagonism between body  and spirit, whereby the former was regarded as an incubus and a curse.  From what has been said this will be recognized as one of the  perversions derived from the alliance of Gnosticism with Christianity.  A result of this grafting in of heathen doctrines was an abundant  growth of hermit practices, by which men sought to weaken, torture,  and subdue their bodies, that their spirits or \"souls\" might gain  greater freedom. Many who adopted this unnatural view of human  existence retired to the solitude of the desert, and there spent their  time in practices of stern self-denial and in acts of frenzied  self-torture. Others shut themselves up as voluntary prisoners,  seeking glory in privation and self-imposed penance. It was this  unnatural view of life that gave rise to the several orders of  recluses, hermits and monks.    23. Think you not that the Savior had such practices in mind, when,  warning the disciples of the false claims to sanctity that would  characterize the times then soon to follow, He said: \"Wherefore if  they shall say unto you, Behold he (Christ) is in the desert; go not  forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not.\"--(Matt.  24:26.)    24. When the Church came into the favor of the state under Constantine  in the fourth century, there sprang up many orders of recluses who  \"maintained that communion with God was to be sought by mortifying  sense, by withdrawing the mind from all external objects, by  macerating the body with hunger and labor, and by a holy sort of  indolence, which confined all the activity of the soul to a lazy  contemplation of things spiritual and external.\" Mosheim, the author  just quoted, continues: \"The Christian church would never have been  disgraced by this cruel and unsocial enthusiasm, nor would any have  been subjected to those keen torments of mind and body to which it  gave rise, had not many Christians been unwarily caught by the  specious appearance and the pompous sound of that maxim of the ancient  philosophy: 'That in order to the attainment of true felicity and  communion with God, it was necessary that the soul should be separated  from the body, even here below; and that the body was to be macerated  and mortified for this purpose.'\"--(Mosheim, \"Eccl. Hist.,\" Cent. IV,  Part II, ch. 3:12, 13.)    25. The fruit of this ill-sowing was the growth of numerous orders of  monks, and the maintenance of monasteries. Celibacy was taught as a  virtue, and came to be made a requirement of the clergy, as it is in  the Roman Catholic church to-day. An unmarried clergy, deprived of the  elevating influences of home life, fell into many excesses, and the  corruption of the priests has been a theme of reproach throughout the  centuries. \"The Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be  alone; I will make "]]]
