It was a current jest of the time that the wares were made to sell and  not to use; a jest which you, as coming from another planet, may  understand, but which our folk could not.\"    Said I: \"What! did they make nothing well?\"    \"Why, yes,\" said he, \"there was one class of goods which they did make  thoroughly well, and that was the class of machines which were used for  making things.  These were usually quite perfect pieces of workmanship,  admirably adapted to the end in view.  So that it may be fairly said that  the great achievement of the nineteenth century was the making of  machines which were wonders of invention, skill, and patience, and which  were used for the production of measureless quantities of worthless make-  shifts.  In truth, the owners of the machines did not consider anything  which they made as wares, but simply as means for the enrichment of  themselves.  Of course the only admitted test of utility in wares was the  finding of buyers for them--wise men or fools, as it might chance.\"    \"And people put up with this?\" said I.    \"For a time,\" said he.    \"And then?\"    \"And then the overturn,\" said the old man, smiling, \"and the nineteenth  century saw itself as a man who has lost his clothes whilst bathing, and  has to walk naked through the town.\"    \"You are very bitter about that unlucky nineteenth century,\" said I.    \"Naturally,\" said he, \"since I know so much about it.\"    He was silent a little, and then said: \"There are traditions--nay, real  histories--in our family about it: my grandfather was one of its victims.  If you know something about it, you will understand what he suffered when  I tell you that he was in those days a genuine artist, a man of genius,  and a revolutionist.\"    \"I think I do understand,\" said I: \"but now, as it seems, you have  reversed all this?\"    \"Pretty much so,\" said he.  \"The wares which we make are made because  they are needed: men make for their neighbours' use as if they were  making for themselves, not for a vague market of which they know nothing,  and over which they have no control: as there is no buying and selling,  it would be mere insanity to make goods on the chance of their being  wanted; for there is no longer anyone who can be compelled to buy them.  So that whatever is made is good, and thoroughly fit for its purpose.  Nothing can be made except for genuine use; therefore no inferior goods  are made.  Moreover, as aforesaid, we have now found out what we want, so  we make no more than we want; and as we are not driven to make a vast  quantity of useless things we have time and resources enough to consider  our pleasure in making them.  All work which would be irksome to do by  hand is done by immensely improved machinery; and in all work which it is  a pleasure to do by hand machinery is done without.  There is no  difficulty in finding work which suits the special turn of mind of  everybody; so that no man is sacrificed to the wants of another.  From  time to time, when we have found out that some piece of work was too  disagreeable or troublesome, we have given it up and done altogether  without the thing produced by it.  Now, surely you can see that under  these circumstances all the work that we do is an exercise of the mind  and body more or less pleasant to be done: so that instead of avoiding  work everybody seeks it: and, since people have got defter in doing the  work generation after generation, it has become so easy to do, that it  seems as if there were less done, though probably more is produced.  I  suppose this explains that fear, which I hinted at just now, of a  possible scarcity in work, which perhaps you have already noticed, and  which is a feeling on the increase, and has been for a score of years.\"    \"But do you think,\" said I, \"that there is any fear of a work-famine  amongst you?\"    \"No, I do not,\" said he, \"and I will tell why; it is each man's business  to make his own work pleasanter and pleasanter, which of course tends  towards raising the standard of excellence, as no man enjoys turning out  work which is not a credit to him, and also to greater deliberation in  turning it out; and there is such a vast number of things which can be  treated as works of art, that this alone gives employment to a host of  deft people.  Again, if art be inexhaustible, so is science also; and  though it is no longer the only innocent occupation which is thought  worth an intelligent man spending his time upon, as it once was, yet  there are, and I suppose will be, many people who are excited by its  conquest of difficulties, and care for it more than for anything else.  Again, as more and more of pleasure is imported into work, I think we  shall take up kinds of work which produce desirable wares, but which we  gave up because we could not carry them on pleasantly.  Moreover, I think  that it is only in parts of Europe which are more advanced than the rest  of the world that you will hear this talk of the fear of a work-famine.  Those lands which were once the colonies of Great Britain, for instance,  and especially America--that part of it, above all, which was once the  United states--are now and will be for a long while a great resource to  us.  For these lands, and, I say, especially the northern parts of  America, suffered so terribly from the full force of the last days of  civilisation, and became such horrible places to live in, that they are  now very backward in all that makes life pleasant.  Indeed, one may say  that for nearly a hundred years the people of the northern parts of  America have been engaged in gradually making a dwelling-place out of a  stinking dust-heap; and there is still a great deal to do, especially as  the country is so big.\"    \"Well,\" said I, \"I am exceedingly glad to think that you have such a  prospect of happiness before you.  But I should like to ask a few more  questions, and then I have done for to-day.\"          CHAPTER XVI: DINNER IN THE HALL OF THE BLOOMSBURY MARKET      As I spoke, I heard footsteps near the door; the latch yielded, and in  came our two lovers, looking so handsome that one had no feeling of shame  in looking on at their little-concealed love-making; for indeed it seemed  as if all the world must be in love with them.  As for old Hammond, he  looked on them like an artist who has just painted a picture nearly as  well as he thought he could when he began it, and was perfectly happy.  He  said:    \"Sit down, sit down, young folk, and don't make a noise.  Our guest here  has still some questions to ask me.\"    \"Well, I should suppose so,\" said Dick; \"you have only been three hours  and a half together; and it isn't to be hoped that the history of two  centuries could be told in three hours and a half: let alone that, for  all I know, you may have been wandering into the realms of geography and  craftsmanship.\"    \"As to noise, my dear kinsman,\" said Clara, \"you will very soon be  disturbed by the noise of the dinner-bell, which I should think will be  very pleasant music to our guest, who breakfasted early, it seems, and  probably had a tiring day yesterday.\"    I said: \"Well, since you have spoken the word, I begin to feel that it is  so; but I have been feeding myself with wonder this long time past:  really, it's quite true,\" quoth I, as I saw her smile, O so prettily!  But  just then from some tower high up in the air came the sound of silvery  chimes playing a sweet clear tune, that sounded to my unaccustomed ears  like the song of the first blackbird in the spring, and called a rush of  memories to my mind, some of bad times, some of good, but all sweetened  now into mere pleasure.    \"No more questions now before dinner,\" said Clara; and she took my hand  as an affectionate child would, and led me out of the room and down  stairs into the forecourt of the Museum, leaving the two Hammonds to  follow as they pleased.    We went into the market-place which I had been in before, a thinnish  stream of elegantly {1} dressed people going in along with us.  We turned  into the cloister and came to a richly moulded and carved doorway, where  a very pretty dark-haired young girl gave us each a beautiful bunch of  summer flowers, and we entered a hall much bigger than that of the  Hammersmith Guest House, more elaborate in its architecture and perhaps  more beautiful.  I found it difficult to keep my eyes off the  wall-pictures (for I thought it bad manners to stare at Clara all the  time, though she was quite worth it).  I saw at a glance that their  subjects were taken from queer old-world myths and imaginations which in  yesterday's world only about half a dozen people in the country knew  anything about; and when the two Hammonds sat down opposite to us, I said  to the old man, pointing to the frieze:    \"How strange to see such subjects here!\"    \"Why?\" said he.  \"I don't see why you should be surprised; everybody  knows the tales; and they are graceful and pleasant subjects, not too  tragic for a place where people mostly eat and drink and amuse  themselves, and yet full of incident.\"    I smiled, and said: \"Well, I scarcely expected to find record of the  Seven Swans and the King of the Golden Mountain and Faithful Henry, and  such curious pleasant imaginations as Jacob Grimm got together from the  childhood of the world, barely lingering even in his time: I should have  thought you would have forgotten such childishness by this time.\"    The old man smiled, and said nothing; but Dick turned rather red, and  broke out:    \"What _do_ you mean, guest?  I think them very beautiful, I mean not only  the pictures, but the stories; and when we were children we used to  imagine them going on in every wood-end, by the bight of every stream:  every house in the fields was the Fairyland King's House to us.  Don't  you remember, Clara?\"    \"Yes,\" she said; and it seemed to me as if a slight"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32677"],[0,"The Invention of the Sewing Machine (#20)"],[1,"        1880                            N.Y., N.Y.

Machines of this type were manufactured for only two years under the  patent of Thomas C. Thompson, March 29, 1853, and later under the  patents of Samuel J. Parker, April 11, 1854, and Simon Coon, May 9,  1854. On September 30, 1853, Elias Howe listed receipts of $1000 from  the American Magnetic Sewing Machine Co. for patent infringement. The  machines manufactured after that date carry the Howe name and 1846  patent date to show proper licensing. Judging by Howe's usual license  fee of $25 per machine, about 40 machines were manufactured prior to  September 1853. The company was reported to have made about 600 machines  in 1854 before it went out of business. The only American Magnetic  machine known to be in existence is in the collection of the Northern  Indiana Historical Society at South Bend, Indiana.

This machine  is typical of the many varieties manufactured for a very short time in  the 1860s and 1870s. It is about the size of the average hand-turned  variety, 8 by 10 inches, but lighter in weight. The frame design was the  patent of L. Porter, May 11, 1869, and the mechanism was patented by  Alonzo Porter, February 8, 1870. The latter patent model bears the  painted legend \"Atlantic\" and is stamped \"Aprl 1, 69,\" indicating that  it was probably already in commercial production. This date possibly may  refer also to L. Porter's design patent, since actual date of issue was  usually later than date of application. (Smithsonian photo 48329-A.)]    [Illustration: Figure 72.--A. BARTHOLF SEWING MACHINE, 1853. Abraham  Bartholf of New York began manufacturing Blodgett & Lerow machines (see  fig. 20) about 1850; the style and mechanics of these machines, however,  were primarily those of the Blodgett & Lerow patent as manufactured by  O. C. Phelps and Goddard, Rice & Co. For this reason they are considered  Blodgett & Lerow--not Bartholf--machines.    The true Bartholf machine evolved when the manufacturer substituted  Howe's reciprocating shuttle for the rotary shuttle of the Blodgett &  Lerow machine, continuing to manufacture the machine in his own adapted  style. Bartholf manufactured reciprocating-shuttle machines as early as  1853, and his was one of the first companies licensed by Howe.    All Bartholf machines licensed under Howe's patent carry the Howe name  and patent date. They are sometimes mistakenly referred to as Howe  machines, but they are no more Howe machines than those manufactured by  Wheeler & Wilson, Singer, or many others.    On April 6, 1858, Bartholf was granted a patent for an improvement of  the shuttle carrier. He continued to manufacture sewing machines under  the name \"Bartholf Sewing Machine Co.\" until about 1865.    Using serial numbers, Bartholf machines can be dated approximately as  follows:      _Serial Number_ _Year_      1-20             1850    21-50            1851    51-100           1852    101-235          1853    236-290          1854    291-321          1855    322-356          1856    357-387          1857    388-590          1858    591-1337         1859    No record of the number of machines produced by Bartholf after 1859 is  available.    The Bartholf machine illustrated bears the serial number 128 and the  inscription \"A. Bartholf Manfr., NY--Patented Sept. 1846 E. Howe, Jr.\"  This machine is in the collection of the Baltimore County Historical  Society. Note the close similarity between it and the 1850 Blodgett &  Lerow machine manufactured by Bartholf.

The Bartlett  machine was first manufactured in 1866 under the January 31, 1865, and  October 10, 1865, patents of Joseph W. Bartlett. The machines were made  by Goodspeed & Wyman for the Bartlett Co. and were so marked. The  inventor received another patent on April 7, 1868, and later machines  carry this third date also.
