Accordingly the apparatus has been modified  so that at present the tension-equalizer is attached directly to the  wall of the calorimeter independent of the air-pipe.    In most of the experiments made thus far it has been our custom to  conduct the supply of fresh oxygen through pet-cock K on the side of the  tension-equalizer. This is shown more in detail in fig. 32, in which,  also, is shown the interior construction of the can. Owing to the fact  that the air inside of this can is much dryer than the room air, we have  followed the custom with the earlier apparatus of placing a vessel  containing sulphuric acid inside the tension-equalizer, so that any  moisture absorbed by the dry air inside the diaphragm may be taken up by  the acid and not be carried into the chamber. The air passing through  the pipe to the calorimeter is, it must be remembered, absolutely dry  and hence there are the best conditions for the passage of moisture from  the outside air through the diaphragm to this dry air. Attaching the  tension-equalizer directly to the calorimeter obviates the necessity for  this drying process and hence the sulphuric-acid vessel has been  discarded.    The valve H (fig. 25) is used to cut off the tension-equalizer  completely from the rest of the system at the exact moment of the end of  the experimental period. After the motor has been stopped and the slight  amount of air partly compressed in the blower has leaked back into the  system, and the whole system is momentarily at equal tension, a process  occupying some 3 or 4 seconds, the gate-valve H is closed. Oxygen is  then admitted from the pet-cock K until there is a definite volume in J  as measured by the height to which the diaphragm can rise or a second  pet-cock is connected to the can I and a delicate petroleum manometer  attached in such a manner that the diaphragm can be filled to exactly  the same tension each time. Under these conditions, therefore,  the apparent volume of air in the system, exclusive of the  tension-equalizer, is always the same, since it is confined by the rigid  walls of the calorimeter and the piping. Furthermore, the apparent  volume of air in the tension-equalizer is arbitrarily adjusted to be the  same amount at the end of each period by closing the valve and  introducing oxygen until the tension is the same.      BAROMETER.    Recognizing the importance of measuring very accurately the barometric  pressure, or at least its fluctuations, we have installed an accurate  barometer of the Fortin type, made by Henry J. Green. This is attached  to the inner wall of the calorimeter laboratory, and since the  calorimeter laboratory is held at a constant temperature, temperature  corrections are unnecessary, for we have here to deal not so much with  the accurate measurement of the actual pressure as with the accurate  measurement of differences in pressure. For convenience in reading, the  ivory needle at the base of the instrument and the meniscus are well  illuminated with electric lamps behind a white screen, and a small lamp  illuminates the vernier. The barometer can be read to 0.05 millimeter.      ANALYSIS OF RESIDUAL AIR.    The carbon-dioxide production, water-vapor elimination, and oxygen  absorption of the subject during 1 or 2 hour periods are recorded in a  general way by the amounts of carbon dioxide and water-vapor absorbed by  the purifying vessels and the loss of weight of the oxygen cylinder;  but, as a matter of fact, there may be considerable fluctuations in the  amounts of carbon dioxide and water-vapor and particularly oxygen in the  large volume of residual air inside the chamber. With carbon dioxide and  water-vapor this is not as noticeable as with oxygen, for in the 1,300  liters of air in the chamber there are some 250 liters of oxygen, and  slight changes in the composition of this air indicate considerable  changes in the amount of oxygen. Great changes may also take place in  the amounts of carbon dioxide and water-vapor under certain conditions.  In some experiments, particularly where there are variations in muscular  activity from period to period, there may be a considerable amount of  carbon dioxide in the residual air and during the next period, when the  muscular activity is decreased, for example, the percentage composition  of the air may vary so much as to indicate a distinct fall in the amount  of carbon dioxide present. Under ordinary conditions of ventilation  during rest experiments the quantity of carbon dioxide present in the  residual air is not far from 8 to 10 grams. There are usually present in  the air not far from 6 to 9 grams of water-vapor, and hence this  residual amount can undergo considerable fluctuations. When it is  considered that an attempt is made to measure the total amount of carbon  dioxide expired in one hour to the fraction of a gram, it is obvious  that fluctuations in the composition of residual air must be taken into  consideration.    It is extremely difficult to get a fair sample of air from the chamber.  The air entering the chamber is free from water-vapor and carbon  dioxide. In the immediate vicinity of the entering air-tube there is air  which has a much lower percentage of carbon dioxide and water-vapor than  the average, and on the other hand close to the nose and mouth of the  subject there is air of a much higher percentage of carbon dioxide and  water-vapor than the average. It has been assumed that the composition  of the air leaving the chamber represents the average composition of the  air in the chamber. This assumption is only in part true, but in rest  experiments (and by far the largest number of experiments are rest  experiments) the changes in the composition of the residual air are so  slow and so small that this assumption is safe for all practical  purposes.    Another difficulty presents itself in the matter of determining the  amount of carbon dioxide and water-vapor; that is, to make a  satisfactory analysis of air without withdrawing too great a volume from  the chamber. The difficulty in analysis is almost wholly confined to the  determination of water-vapor, for while there are a large number of  methods for determining small amounts of carbon dioxide with great  accuracy, the method for determining water-vapor to be accurate calls  for the use of rather large quantities of air. From preliminary  experiments with a sling psychrometer it was found that its use was  precluded by the space required to successfully use this instrument, the  addition of an unknown amount of water to the chamber from the wet bulb,  and the difficulties of reading the instrument from without the chamber.  Recourse was had to the determination of moisture by the absolute  method, in that a definite amount of air is caused to pass over  pumice-stone saturated with sulphuric acid. It is of interest here to  record that at the moment of writing a series of experiments are in  progress in which an attempt is being made to use a hair hygrometer for  this purpose.    The method of determining the water-vapor and carbon dioxide in the  residual air is extremely simple, in that a definite volume of air is  caused to pass over sulphuric acid and soda-lime contained in U-tubes.  In other words, a small amount of air is caused to pass through a small  absorbing-system constructed of U-tubes rather than of porcelain vessels  and silver-plated cans. Formerly a very elaborate apparatus was employed  for aspirating the air from the chamber through U-tubes and then  returning the aspirated air to the chamber. This involved the use of a  suction-pump and called for a special installation for maintaining the  pressure of water constant. More recently a much simpler device has been  employed, in that we have taken advantage of the pressure in the  ventilating air-system developed by the passage of air through the  blower. After forcing a definite quantity of air through the reagents in  the U-tubes, it is then conducted back to the system after having been  measured in a gas-meter.    This procedure is best noted from fig. 30. The connected series of three  U-tubes on the rack on the table is joined on one end by well-fitting  rubber connections to the tube leading from the mercurial manometer and  on the other end to the rubber tube A leading to the gas-meter. On  lowering the mercury reservoir E, the mercury is drained out of the tube  D and air passes through both arms of the tube and then through the  three U-tubes. In the first of these it is deprived of moisture, and in  the last two of carbon dioxide. The air then enters the meter, where it  is measured and leaves the meter through the tube B, saturated with  water-vapor at the room temperature. To remove this water-vapor the air  is passed through a tower filled with pumice-stone drenched with  sulphuric acid. It leaves the tower through the tube C and enters the  ventilating air-pipe on its way to the calorimeter.    The method of manipulation is very simple. After connecting the U-tubes  the pet-cock connecting the tube C with the pipe is opened, the mercury  reservoir E is lowered, and air is allowed to pass through until the  meter registers 10 liters. By raising the reservoir E the air supply is  shut off, and after closing the stop-cock at C the tubes are  disconnected, a second set is put in place, and the operation repeated.  The U-tubes are of a size having a total length of the glass portion  equal to 270 millimeters and an internal diameter of 16 millimeters.  They permit the passage of 3 liters of air per minute through"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28233"],[0,"Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica (#20)"],[1,"verse; sitq; DL,  atq; adeo areæ nascens DLME, ut idem latus quadratum inverse: erit tempus  ut area DLME, & summa omnium temporum ut summa omnium arearum, hoc est (per  Corol.
