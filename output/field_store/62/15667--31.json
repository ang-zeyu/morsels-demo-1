His forces occupied the territory north of Verdun to  a southern point not far from Bar-le-Duc. Here the German secret service  seems to have been as efficient, as it failed to be with regard to  conditions only fifty miles away. General Sarrail's army, which  confronted the army of the crown prince, was somewhat weak. It consisted  of about two army corps with reserve divisions. Nor could General Joffre  send any reenforcements. Every available source of reenforcements had  been drawn upon to aid the Sixth Army, encamped upon the banks of the  Ourcq, in order that Paris might be well guarded. No troops could be  spared from the Fifth and Ninth Armies, which had to bear the brunt of  the attack from the German center. General Sarrail, therefore, had to  depend on the natural difficulties of the country and to avoid giving  battle too readily against the superior forces by which he was  confronted. It was a part of the plan of the French generalissimo,  however, to feel the strength of the German center, and if it proved  that they could be held, to release several divisions and send them to  the aid of General Sarrail.    Subordinate to this contemplated attack by the crown prince, yet forming  a part of it, and, in a measure, a fourth element in the campaign, was  the double effort from the garrisons of Metz and Saarbruecken, combining  with the armies of the Bavarian Crown Prince and the forces of General  von Heeringen. The Second French Army, therefore, could not come to the  aid of the Third, except in desperate need, for it was in the very  forefront of the attack on Nancy. If the German left could pierce the  French lines at Nancy and pour through the Gap of Lorraine, it would be  able to take General Sarrail's army in the rear at Bar-le-Duc, and would  thus completely hem it in, at the same time isolating Verdun, which,  thus invested in the course of time must fall, forming an invaluable  advanced fortress to the German advance.    [Illustration: Battle of the Marne--Situation on September 9, 1914.]    Before proceeding to the actual working out of this plan of campaign it  may be well to recapitulate it, in order that each development may be  clear. The German plan was to pierce the French line at three places, at  Meaux, at Bar-le-Duc and at Nancy. General von Kluck, at Meaux, would  cut off the Fifth and the Ninth Armies from communication with their  base at Paris, the Bavarian Crown Prince would weaken General Sarrail's  defense in the rear, and if possible come up behind him, and thus the  stage would be set for the great onrush of the Imperial Crown Prince,  who, with an almost fresh army, and with a most complete and elaborate  system of communications and supplies, should be able to crush the weak  point in France's defense, the army under General Sarrail. Such a  victory was designed to shed an especial luster upon the crown prince  and thus upon the Hohenzollern dynasty, a prestige much needed, for the  delays in the advance of the crown prince's army had already given rise  to mutterings of discontent. From a strategical point of view the plan  was sound and brilliant, the disposition of the forces was excellently  contrived, and the very utmost of military skill had been used in  bringing matters to a focus.    The French plan, is the next to be considered. From official orders and  dispatches and also from the developments of that week, it is clear that  General Joffre had perceived the possibility of such a plan as the  Germans had actually conceived. He had brought back his armies--and  there is nothing harder to handle than a retreating army--step by step  over northern France without losing them their morale. The loss of life  was fearful, but it never became appalling. The French soldiers had  faith in Joffre, even as their faith in France, and, while the Germans  had victories to cheer them on, the soldiers of the Allies had to keep  up their courage under the perpetual strain of retreat. The  administration had evacuated Paris. Everywhere it seemed that the  weakness of France was becoming apparent. To the three armies in the  field, those commanded severally by General Manoury, Sir John French,  and General Lanrezac, the generalissimo steadily sent reenforcements.  But he informed the French Government that he was not able to save the  capital from a siege. Yet, as after events showed, while these various  conditions could not rightly be considered as ruses upon General  Joffre's part to lure on the Germans, there is no doubt that he  understood and took full advantage of the readiness of the attacking  hosts to esteem all these points as prophetic of future victory. The  first feature of the French plan, therefore, was to lend color to the  German belief that the armies of the Allies were disheartened and  thereby to induce the attacking forces to join the issue quickly.    The second part of the French plan lay in General Joffre's decision not  to do the expected thing. With General Sarrail placed at the extremest  point of danger, it would have been a likely move to transfer the entire  British Expeditionary Force from the left wing to the weak point at  Bar-le-Duc. There is reason to believe that General von Kluck believed  that this had been done.    The third part of the defensive prepared by General Joffre was that of a  determination to turn the steady retreat into a counterdrive. Time after  time had the other generals implored their leader to give them leave to  take the offensive, and on every occasion a shake of the head had been  the reply. Sir John French had wondered. But when the French officers  found themselves in the region of the Marne, close to the marshes of St.  Gond, where in 1814 Napoleon had faced the Russians, they were more  content. It was familiar as well as historic ground. Even the youngest  officer knew every foot of that ground thoroughly. It was, at the same  time, the best point for the forward leap and one of the last points at  which a halt could be made.    The fourth part of the plan was the holding fast to the point of Verdun,  for thereby the communication of the armies of the Central Powers was  seriously weakened. It is to be remembered that this actual fighting  army of more than a million men depended for food and for ammunition  supplies upon the routes from Belgium and Luxemburg by way of Mezieres  and Montmedy, and the circuitous line to Brussels via St. Quentin. Had  Maubeuge fallen a little earlier the situation of the Central Powers  would have been less difficult, and both commissariat and ammunition  problems would have been easier of solution. But Maubeuge held out until  September 7, 1914, and by that time the prime results of the battles of  the Marne had been achieved. To this problem Verdun was the key, for  from Metz through Verdun ran the main line, less than one-half the  length of line to the Belgian bases of supplies, and, owing to the  nature of the country, a line that could be held with a quarter the  number of men. But Verdun stood, and General Joffre held the two armies  back to back, converging on the point at Verdun.    Such was the country over which the battles of the Marne were fought,  such were the numbers and dispositions of the several armies on each  side, and such, as far as can be judged, were the plans and counterplans  of the strategic leaders in the great conflict.          CHAPTER XIV    FIRST MOVES IN THE BATTLE      The first movement in this concerted plan was taken by the German  extreme right. This was the closing in of General von Kluck's army in a  southeasterly direction. It was a hazardous move, for it required  General von Kluck to execute a flank march diagonally across the front  of the Sixth French Army and the British Expeditionary Force. At this  time, according to the dispatches from Sir John French, the British army  lay south of the Marne between Lagny and Signy-Signets, defending the  passage of the river and blowing up the bridges before General von  Kluck.    On September 4, 1914, air reconnaissances showed that General von Kluck  had stopped his southward advance upon Paris, and that his columns were  moving in a southeasterly direction east of a line drawn through  Nanteuil and Lizy on the Ourcq. Meanwhile the French and British  generals more effectually concealed their armies in the forests, doing  so with such skill that their movements were unmarked by the German air  scouts. All that day General von Kluck moved his forces, leaving his  heavy artillery with about 100,000 men on the steep eastern bank of the  Ourcq and taking 150,000 troops south across the Marne toward La Ferte  Gaucher. He crossed the Petit Morin and the Grand Morin, all unconscious  that scores of field glasses were trained upon his troops.    Probably believing that the British army had been hurried to the aid of  General Sarrail, General von Kluck advanced confidently. Having  concealment in view, the commanders of the French army and the British  army between them had left a wide gap between the two armies. Through  one of these apparently unguarded openings a strong body of uhlan  patrols advanced, riding southward until they reached Nogent, south of  Paris, and seemingly with the whole rich country of central France laid  wide open to a sharp and sudden attack. Among the many strange features  of this series of the battles of the Marne this must certainly be  reckoned as one. Though possessing an unequaled military organization,  though priding itself on its cavalry scouts, though aided by aerial  scouts, and though well supplied with spies, yet the Allied armies, with  the age-old device of a forest, were able to cloak their movements from  this perfectly organized and powerful invading army. Much of the credit  of this may be assigned to the French and English aircraft, which kept  German scouting aircraft at"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29349"],[0,"Creatures of the Night: A Book of Wild Life in Western Britain (#20)"],[1,"  rat had been killed, and that the place was thickly strewn with the  feathers of two dying owls.    During the rest of the summer, Kweek led a strangely peaceful life,  having little to fear beyond an occasional visit from Reynard, or from  an astute old magpie that, evading with apparent ease the keeper's gun  and pole-traps, lived on till the late autumn, when, before a line of  beaters, he broke cover over some sportsmen waiting for their driven  game. As soon as the leaves began to fall and exhausted Nature longed  for winter's rest, the burrow in the pasture became the scene of  feverish activity. Kweek was now the proud sire of five or six healthy  families, and the grand-sire of many more. Even the youngest voles were  growing fat and strong; and, when the numerous members of the colony set  about harvesting their winter stores, ripe, delicious seeds were  plentiful everywhere along the margin of the wood.    The winter was uniformly mild, with exception of one short period of  great cold which brought a thorough, healthful sleep to the voles; and  in the earliest days of spring, when the love-calls of chaffinches and  tits were heard from almost every tree, Kweek and his tribe resumed  their work and throve amazingly. Every circumstance appeared to favour  their well-being. But for the fox, that sometimes crouched beside an  opening to the burrow and snapped up an incautious venturer peeping  above ground, a young sheep-dog, whose greatest pleasure in life seemed  to be found in digging a large round hole in the centre of the burrow,  and an adder, that stung a few of the weaklings to death, but found them  inconveniently big for swallowing, the voles were seldom troubled. Their  numbers, and those of every similar colony in the neighbourhood,  increased in such a fashion that, before the following autumn, both the  pasture and the near ploughland were barren wastes completely  honeycombed with their dwellings. Every grass-root in the pasture was  eaten up; every stalk in the cornfield was nibbled through so  that the grain might be easily reached and devoured; and the  root-crops--potatoes, turnips, and mangolds--on the far side of the  cornfield were utterly spoiled; and in the hedgerows and the copse the  leaves dropped from the lifeless trees, each of which was marked by a  complete ring where the bark was gnawed away close to the ground.    But capricious Nature, as if regretting the haste with which she had  brought into the world her destructive little children, and desiring,  even at the cost of untold suffering and the loss of countless lives, to  restore the pleasant Cerdyn valley to its beauty of green fields and  leafy woods, sent her twin plagues of disease and starvation among the  voles, till, like the sapless leaves, they withered and died. And from  far and near the hawks and the owls, the weasels, the stoats, and the  foxes hastened to the scene. The keeper, at a loss to know whence they  came, and not understanding the lesson he was being taught, bewailed his  misfortune, but dared not stay their advent. At almost any hour of the  day, five or six kestrels might be seen quartering the fields or  hovering here and there among the burrows. And, long before dark, the  stoats and the weasels, as if knowing that, fulfilling a special  mission, they were now safe from their arch-enemy, the keeper, hunted  their prey through the \"trash\" of the hedge-banks, or in and out of the  passages underground.    The farm labourers, in desperate haste, dug numerous pitfalls, wide at  the bottom but narrow at the mouth, and trapped hundreds of the voles,  which, maddened by hunger but unable to climb the sloping sides,  attacked one another--all at last dying a miserable death. Not only did  the customary enemies of the voles arrive on the scene: Nature called to  her great task a number of unexpected destroyers--sea-gulls from the  distant coast, a kite from a wooded island on a desolate, far-off mere,  and a buzzard from a rocky fastness, rarely visited save by keepers and  shepherds, near the up-country lakes. Food had gradually become scarce  even for the few hundred voles that yet remained. No longer were they to  be seen at play together, in little groups, during the cool, hazy  twilight, that, earlier in the year, shimmered like a wonderful  afterglow on the mossy pasture-floor. Now their only desire was for  food and sleep.    Unnoticed by a passing owl, Kweek, worn to a skeleton by sickness and  privation, crawled from his burrow into the moonlight of a calm, clear  autumn night, and lay in the shadow of the stone where the old male vole  had watched and listened for the cruel \"vear.\" A big blow-fly,  attracted, with countless thousands of his kind, to the place of  slaughter and decay, had gone to sleep on the side of the stone, and  Kweek, in a last desperate effort to obtain a little food, moved forward  to secure his prize; but at that moment his strength failed him, his  weary limbs relaxed, and the dull, grey film of death overspread his  half-closed eyes.    The owl, hearing a faint sound like the rustle of a dry grass-bent,  quickly turned in her flight; then, slanting her wings, dropped to the  ground, and presently, with her defenceless quarry in her talons, flew  away towards the woods.          THE FOX.    I.    THE LAST HUNT.      A dark and wind-swept night had fallen over the countryside when Reynard  left the steep slope above the keeper's cottage, and stole through gorse  and brambles towards the outskirts of the covert, where a narrow dingle,  intersected by a noisy rill and thickly matted with brown bracken,  divided the furze from some neighbouring pine-woods.    For months nothing had occurred to disturb the peace of his woodland  home. Once, about a year ago, he had fled for his life before the  hounds; and again, during the last autumn, while lying hidden in the  ditch of the root-crop field above the pines, he had been surprised by  two sheep-dogs that nipped him sorely before he could make good his  escape. But at no other time had he been in evident peril, and so,  though naturally cunning and suspicious, he had grown bolder, and better  acquainted with the neighbourhood of cottage and farmstead than were  certain members of his family living on the opposite side of the valley,  among thickets hunted regularly, where guns and spaniels might be heard  from early morning till close of day.    Here and there, as the fox crept stealthily among the blackthorns and  the gorse-bushes, he stopped for a moment on the scent of a rabbit; but  the night was not such as to induce Bunny to remain outside her cosy  burrow in the bank. He examined each \"creep\" in the tangled clumps along  his way, and sometimes, resting on his haunches, sniffed the air and  listened intently for any sign to indicate the presence of a feeding  coney; but even the strongest taint was \"stale,\" and no sound could be  detected that might betray the whereabouts of any creature feeding in  the grass. Disappointed, the fox turned towards the uplands and crossed  the hedgerow into the nearest stubble. Louping leisurely along, he  surprised and killed a sleeping lark. Further on he crossed the scent  of a hare, but Puss was doubtless some distance away, feeding in a quiet  corner of the root-crop field. Reynard now instinctively made for the  farmyard among the pines, trusting meanwhile that luck would befriend  him. Across the gap, by the side of the hedgerow, and through an open  gateway, he went, seeking spoil everywhere, but finding none. With all  his senses alert, he climbed the low wall around the yard, peeped into  the empty cart-house, and stealthily approached an open shed. There,  unluckily, the dogs were sleeping on a load of hay in the furthest  corner. Careful not to arouse his foes, the fox retreated, and, passing  the pond at the bottom of the yard, moved silently towards another shed,  in which, as he knew from a former visit, the poultry roosted. Though  the door was shut, an opening for the use of the fowls seemed to afford  the possibility of success. With difficulty Reynard managed to squeeze  himself in, only, however, to no purpose. Just beyond the door lay a  loose coil of wire, brought home by the labourers after fencing and  thrown here out of the way. The fox, fearing a trap, reluctantly  abandoned his project, returned to the bank by the pond, and crept down  the lane to a spot where the ducks were housed in a neat shelter built  in the wall. But here he found everything securely fastened. At this  moment a door of the farmstead creaked loudly, the light of a lantern  flooded the yard, and the baffled marauder sprang over the wall and  trotted across the field towards the wood.    His pace soon slackened when he found himself free from pursuit; and  before he reached the end of the meadow he had regained all his cool  audacity and was busily planning a visit to the cottage at the foot of  the dingle. Hardly had his thoughts turned once more to hunting when  fortune favoured him. A hen from the farmyard had laid her eggs in the  hedgerow bordering the wood, and was brooding over them in proud  anticipation of one day leading home a healthy family, thus causing an  agreeable surprise to the farmer's wife. The fox almost brushed against  her as he sprang over the hedge, and she paid to the utmost the penalty  of indiscretion.    After feasting royally on the eggs, the fox took up the dead bird, and  moved slowly away through the trees towards his home. Re-entering the  covert, he was met by a prowling vixen that, in company with her four  young cubs, inhabited an \"earth\" not many yards away. Reckless through  hunger and maddened by the scent of blood, she attacked him savagely,  bullied him out of the possession of the dead fowl, and bore her prize  away in triumph to her den. The fox endured his ill-treatment with the  submission of a Stoic--he happened to be the pugnacious vixen's"]]]
