Deer, bear and fur-bearing animals were  so plentiful that it only required a small territory to find game  sufficiently plenty to keep the trapper on a lively gait all the  time. In those days we made it more a specialty of hunting deer for  the profit there was in it. We had built our cabin on the divide  between the headwaters of the Cross fork of Kettel Creek and the  headwaters of the East Fork of the Sinnamahoning. I had built a few  deadfalls and bear pens for bear and also had three or four steel  bear traps set, but beech-nuts, chestnuts and other nuts were so  plentiful that the bear would not take meat bait and I had no other  bait at hand. The bear would pass within a few feet of a trap and pay  no attention to the bait.    Now at this time, furs were so low that there was but little to be  made from the sale of the pelts of the fox, mink, skunk, etc. But it  was my custom to carry one or two steel traps in my pack sack and  when I killed a deer, I would make a set or two for the fox, marten  or fisher, whichever happened along first. As I have stated I spent  the greater part of my time in deer hunting. On this particular day I  was following a drove of four or five deer, but the wind was so  unsteady and whirling about in puffs so that as near as I could get  to a deer was to see his white flag, beckoning me to come on as they  jumped a log or some other object. Striking the trail of a bear that  had gone back and forth several times, nearly in the same place  within the past three or four days, since a light snow had fallen, I  was satisfied that it was a bear going back and forth from his  lodging quarters to his feeding grounds.    So I left the trail of the deer and took up the trail of the bear,  taking the track that I thought had been made last. I did not follow  the trail far, which led along the brow of the ridge, when I saw that  the several different bear tracks were forming into one trail and  making in the direction of several large hemlock trees that had been  turned out by the roots and lay in a jumbled up mess. I followed the  trail carefully until I was certain that the bear had entered the  jungle of timber. Here I worked carefully around the jam of timber  until sure that the bear was in the jungle and that it would be  impossible for me to get near the bear. The density of brush and  undergrowth was such that I would drive the bear out before I could  get close enough to Bruin to get a shot at him. And this was a time,  when I longed for a pard.    Being convinced that I could do nothing alone, I got out on one side  of the trail the bear had made in going back and forth and watched  until dark, in hopes that Bruin would come out on his way to his  feeding grounds. But in this I was mistaken so was obliged to give up  the hunt for the time being and make tracks for the shanty. My camp  was about five or six miles from Edgcomb Place, this being the  nearest point to where anyone lived, where I might get help to rout  Bruin. The Edgcomb Place was a sort of a half way house, it being  about fourteen miles either way to a settlement. The stage made one  trip a week over this road and stopped at Edgcomb Place for dinner  and often some one would come out from town in the stage and stop  there for a few days' hunt. It was one of these parties that I was in  hopes of getting to help me out in this bear hunt.    I started in the morning before daylight as the stage had gone the  Kettel Creek way the day before, which was in my favor of catching  help at the hotel. As good luck proved to be on my side, I found a  man at the hotel by the name of John Howard, who was stopping there  for a few days' hunt. He was more than anxious to join me in the bear  hunt. We hastened back to camp so as to get onto the job as quickly  as possible. We got to the shanty about noon and got a hasty lunch  and started out to wake Bruin up if he was still sleeping where I had  left him.    When we got to the jam of timber, we found that he had been to his  feeding grounds and had returned to his lodging apartments during the  night, so we now thought that we would soon make sure of our game. We  located the spot the best we could where we thought Bruin was  sleeping and began to cautiously work our way in from opposite sides.  It only took a short time to work our way into the jam sufficiently  to locate a large root, where Bruin's tracks showed plainly that he  was sleeping under this root. We continued to work our way up closer  to the root with gun in hand for ready action. But still Bruin did  not show up, neither could we hear the least bit of a noise from him.    When we were within a few feet of the root, Mr. Howard on one side  and the writer on the other side, suddenly, without any warning  whatever, Bruin came out of his hole like a shot out of a gun and  nearly landed on Mr. Howard, who sprang backwards to escape him. Mr.  Howard's feet became tangled in the thick brush, he fell backwards  and before he could regain his feet, Bruin had gone over the brow of  the ridge, into the laurel out of sight. Mr. Howard was not able to  get in a shot at Bruin, as I was on the other side of the root and on  higher ground, I managed to empty both barrels of my rifle at him  through the thick brush, but Bruin went on down the hill, through the  laurel, apparently unhurt.    After following the trail of Bruin for some distance, we began, now  and then, to find a little blood, where the bear had crawled over a  log or rubbed against the laurel. We followed him until we found one  or two places where he had broken down a few laurel and scratched  about in trying to make a bed, so we thought the better plan was to  let Bruin go for the night and let him make his bed.    But we did not go to camp empty handed for good luck favored Mr.  Howard in killing a good, big deer on our way to the shanty. After  leaving the trail of the bear, we followed up a spur of the main  ridge that led to camp, Mr. Howard going up one side of the spur  while I took the other spur. Just before reaching the top of the  spur, I heard Mr. Howard shoot and in a few minutes I heard him  shouting for help. When I got across the ridge to where he was, I  found him dressing a good sized buck. As it was getting dark we lost  no time in taking the entrails out of the deer, cutting a withe with  a hook, which we hooked into the lower jaw of the deer. We hooked  ourselves to the withe and made lively tracks to the shanty, where we  could talk and laugh of the day's hunt.    * * *    We were up early the next morning and had our lunch packed in our  knapsack, ready for an early start. It had turned warm during the  night and the light snow that was on the ground, was fast  disappearing. So we lost no time in getting back to where we had left  Bruin's track the night before. We could still manage to follow the  trail on the snow and we soon found where Bruin had broken down a few  laurel and tried to make a bed. But he would not stop long,  apparently, when he would move on for a short distance and again  break down a few laurels as before to make a nest. We could see a  little more blood at each place where he stopped than the one before.    We were working the trail as cautious as we could, when we heard a  noise in the thick laurel to our left and got a glimpse of Bruin  going through the laurel. We emptied both barrels of our guns in the  direction where we could see the brush wiggle, but all of our shots  failed to take effect. Bruin now left this laurel patch, crossed a  ravine and began to climb another spur of the main ridge. We did not  follow the trail long, when we discovered that it was becoming hard  work for Bruin to travel far at a time, as he would stop to rest. The  snow was now gone so that it was a little more difficult to follow  the trail of the bear. We thought that it would be better for one of  us to go up the ravine to the top of the ridge and stand about where  he thought that the bear would come out at the top of the ridge. Mr.  Howard went to the ridge, while I was to follow the bear's trail.    After waiting long enough to give Mr. Howard time to get to the top  of the ridge, I took up the trail of the bear. I had not gone far  when I came to a bed, where the bear had stopped for a time. I was  now sure Mr. Howard would get to his watching place before the bear  reached the top of the hill. I was not mistaken, for it was not long  until I heard Mr. Howard fire both barrels of his gun in rapid  succession. I thought when I heard the two shots that the bear hunt  was surely over, but after listening a few moments and hearing  nothing from Mr. Howard I was then unable to give a guess what he had  done. I worked along on the trail until near the top of the hill when  I saw Mr. Howard standing with head down and bearing the expression  of a motherless colt.    When I got up to him he said that the bear had stopped near the brow  of the ridge and when he came in sight, the bear started across the  ridge and he fired both barrels of his rifle at him but the bear was  so far away that he could not reach him. The bear now crossed the  ridge in the direction of Windfall Run, a branch of the Cross Fork  and toward a large windfall. We followed the bear a short distance in  to the windfall. Briers and brush were so thick that it was almost  impossible to work our way along in the brush and one could scarcely  see ten feet ahead. We had followed the trail but a short distance  when we could hear Bruin whining like a little puppy and soon we  could see him sitting up on his haunches and keeping up the whine. We  soon put an end to his troubles. When we removed the bear's entrails,  we found that one of the shots that we fired at him at the beginning  of the hunt, had passed through the lungs but had not"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3407"],[0,"The Spell of Egypt (#20)"],[1,"et-places. There is no peace like the  peace in certain of their mosques. Even without the slippers carefully  tied over your boots you would walk softly, gingerly, in the mosque of  El Movayad, the mosque of the columns and the garden. For once within  the door you have taken wings and flown from the city, you are in a  haven where the most delicious calm seems floating like an atmosphere.  Through a lofty colonnade you come into the mosque, and find yourself  beneath a magnificently ornamental wooden roof, the general effect of  which is of deep brown and gold, though there are deftly introduced  many touches of very fine red and strong, luminous blue. The walls are  covered with gold and superb marbles, and there are many quotations  from the Koran in Arab lettering heavy with gold. The great doors are  of chiseled bronze and of wood. In the distance is a sultan's tomb,  surmounted by a high and beautiful cupola, and pierced with windows of  jeweled glass. But the attraction of this place of prayer comes less  from its magnificence, from the shining of its gold, and the gleaming of  its many-colored marbles, than from its spaciousness, its airiness, its  still seclusion, and its garden. Mohammedans love fountains and shady  places, as can surely love them only those who carry in their minds a  remembrance of the desert. They love to have flowers blowing beside them  while they pray. And with the immensely high and crenelated walls of  this mosque long ago they set a fountain of pure white marble, covered  it with a shelter of limestone, and planted trees and flowers about it.  There beneath palms and tall eucalyptus-trees even on this misty day of  the winter, roses were blooming, pinks scented the air, and great red  flowers, that looked like emblems of passion, stared upward almost  fiercely, as if searching for the sun. As I stood there among the  worshippers in the wide colonnade, near the exquisitely carved pulpit  in the shadow of which an old man who looked like Abraham was swaying to  and fro and whispering his prayers, I thought of Omar Khayyam and how he  would have loved this garden. But instead of water from the white marble  fountain, he would have desired a cup of wine to drink beneath the  boughs of the sheltering trees. And he could not have joined without  doubt or fear in the fervent devotions of the undoubting men, who came  here to steep their wills in the great will that flowed about them like  the ocean about little islets of the sea.    From the \"Red Mosque\" I went to the great mosque of El-Azhar, to  the wonderful mosque of Sultan Hassan, which unfortunately was being  repaired and could not be properly seen, though the examination of  the old portal covered with silver, gold, and brass, the general  color-effect of which is a delicious dull green, repaid me for my visit,  and to the exquisitely graceful tomb-mosque of Kait Bey, which is beyond  the city walls. But though I visited these, and many other mosques and  tombs, including the tombs of the Khalifas, and the extremely smart  modern tombs of the family of the present Khedive of Egypt, no building  dedicated to worship, or to the cult of the dead, left a more lasting  impression upon my mind than the Coptic church of Abu Sergius, or Abu  Sargah, which stands in the desolate and strangely antique quarter  called \"Old Cairo.\" Old indeed it seems, almost terribly old. Silent and  desolate is it, untouched by the vivid life of the rich and prosperous  Egypt of to-day, a place of sad dreams, a place of ghosts, a place of  living spectres. I went to it alone. Any companion, however dreary,  would have tarnished the perfection of the impression Old Cairo and its  Coptic church can give to the lonely traveller.    I descended to a gigantic door of palm-wood which was set in an old  brick arch. This door upon the outside was sheeted with iron. When it  opened, I left behind me the world I knew, the world that belongs to us  of to-day, with its animation, its impetus, its flashing changes, its  sweeping hurry and \"go.\" I stepped at once into, surely, some moldering  century long hidden in the dark womb of the forgotten past. The door  of palm-wood closed, and I found myself in a sort of deserted town,  of narrow, empty streets, beetling archways, tall houses built of grey  bricks, which looked as if they had turned gradually grey, as hair does  on an aged head. Very, very tall were these houses. They all appeared  horribly, almost indecently, old. As I stood and stared at them, I  remembered a story of a Russian friend of mine, a landed proprietor,  on whose country estate dwelt a peasant woman who lived to be over a  hundred. Each year when he came from Petersburg, this old woman arrived  to salute him. At last she was a hundred and four, and, when he left his  estate for the winter, she bade him good-bye for ever. For ever! But,  lo! the next year there she still was--one hundred and five years old,  deeply ashamed and full of apologies for being still alive. \"I cannot  help it,\" she said. \"I ought no longer to be here, but it seems I do not  know anything. I do not know even how to die!\" The grey, tall houses  of Old Cairo do not know how to die. So there they stand, showing their  haggard facades, which are broken by protruding, worm-eaten, wooden  lattices not unlike the shaggy, protuberant eyebrows which sometimes  sprout above bleared eyes that have seen too much. No one looked out  from these lattices. Was there, could there be, any life behind them?  Did they conceal harems of centenarian women with wrinkled faces,  and corrugated necks and hands? Here and there drooped down a string  terminating in a lamp covered with minute dust, that wavered in the  wintry wind which stole tremulously between the houses. And the houses  seemed to be leaning forward, as if they were fain to touch each other  and leave no place for the wind, as if they would blot out the exiguous  alleys so that no life should ever venture to stir through them again.  Did the eyes of the Virgin Mary, did the baby eyes of the Christ Child,  ever gaze upon these buildings? One could almost believe it. One could  almost believe that already these buildings were there when, fleeing  from the wrath of Herod, Mother and Child sought the shelter of the  crypt of Abu Sargah.    I went on, walking with precaution, and presently I saw a man. He was  sitting collapsed beneath an archway, and he looked older than  the world. He was clad in what seemed like a sort of cataract of  multi-colored rags. An enormous white beard flowed down over his  shrunken breast. His face was a mass of yellow wrinkles. His eyes were  closed. His yellow fingers were twined about a wooden staff. Above his  head was drawn a patched hood. Was he alive or dead? I could not tell,  and I passed him on tiptoe. And going always with precaution between the  tall, grey houses and beneath the lowering arches, I came at last to the  Coptic church.    Near it, in the street, were several Copts--large, fat, yellow-skinned,  apparently sleeping, in attitudes that made them look like bundles. I  woke one up, and asked to see the church. He stared, changed slowly from  a bundle to a standing man, went away and presently, returning with a  key and a pale, intelligent-looking youth, admitted me into one of the  strangest buildings it was ever my lot to enter.    The average Coptic church is far less fascinating than the average  mosque, but the church of Abu Sargah is like no other church that I  visited in Egypt. Its aspect of hoary age makes it strangely, almost  thrillingly impressive. Now and then, in going about the world, one  comes across a human being, like the white-bearded man beneath the  arch, who might be a thousand years old, two thousand, anything, whose  appearance suggests that he or she, perhaps, was of the company which  was driven out of Eden, but that the expulsion was not recorded. And now  and then one happens upon a building that creates the same impression.  Such a building is this church. It is known and recorded that more than  a thousand years ago it had a patriarch whose name was Shenuti; but it  is supposed to have been built long before that time, and parts of it  look as if they had been set up at the very beginning of things. The  walls are dingy and whitewashed. The wooden roof is peaked, with many  cross-beams. High up on the walls are several small square lattices of  wood. The floor is of discolored stone. Everywhere one sees wood wrought  into lattices, crumbling carpets that look almost as frail and brittle  and fatigued as wrappings of mummies, and worn-out matting that  would surely become as the dust if one set his feet hard upon it. The  structure of the building is basilican, and it contains some strange  carvings of the Last Supper, the Nativity, and St. Demetrius. Around the  nave there are monolithic columns of white marble, and one column of  the red and shining granite that is found in such quantities at Assuan.  There are three altars in three chapels facing toward the East. Coptic  monks and nuns are renowned for their austerity of life, and their  almost fierce zeal in fasting and in prayer, and in Coptic churches  the services are sometimes so long that the worshippers, who are almost  perpetually standing, use crutches for their support. In their churches  there always seems to me to be a cold and austere atmosphere, far  different from the atmosphere of the mosques or of any Roman Catholic  church. It sometimes rather repels me, and generally make me feel  either dull or sad. But in this immensely old church of Abu Sargah the  atmosphere of melancholy aids the imagination.    In Coptic churches there is generally a great deal of woodwork made into  lattices, and into the screens which mark the divisions, usually four,  but occasionally five, which each church contains, and, which are set  apart for the altar, for the priests, singers, and ministrants, for "]]]
