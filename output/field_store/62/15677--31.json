IV, pp. 488-490.      He added another paragraph which he later struck out as being of little  importance; but it throws an interesting sidelight upon the customs of  the time.    \"The Gentlemen provided at Faneul Hall some biscuit & cheese four qr  Casks of wine three barrels & two hogs of punch the moment they found  that the people had drank sufficiently means were taken to overset the  two hogspunch this being done the company dispersed and the day ended  most agreeably\"*            * Ibid.      Maryland came next. When the Federal Convention was breaking up, Luther  Martin was speaking of the new system of government to his colleague,  Daniel of St. Thomas Jenifer, and exclaimed: \"I'll be hanged if ever  the people of Maryland agree to it!\" To which his colleague retorted:  \"I advise you to stay in Philadelphia, lest you should be hanged.\" And  Jenifer proved to be right, for in Maryland the Federalists obtained  control of the convention and, by a vote of 63 to 11, ratified the  Constitution on the 26th of April.    In South Carolina, which was the Southern State next in importance to  Virginia, the compromise on the slave trade proved to be one of the  deciding factors in determining public opinion. When the elections were  held, they resulted in an overwhelming majority for the Federalists, so  that after a session of less than two weeks the convention ratified the  Constitution, on the 28th of May, by a vote of over two to one.    The only apparent setback which the adoption of the Constitution had  thus far received was in New Hampshire, where the convention met early  in February and then adjourned until June to see what the other States  might do. But this delay proved to be of no consequence for, when the  time came for the second meeting of the New Hampshire delegates, eight  States had already acted favorably and adoption was regarded as a  certainty. This was sufficient to put a stop to any further waiting, and  New Hampshire added its name to the list on the 21st of June; but the  division of opinion was fairly well represented by the smallness of the  majority, the vote standing 57 to 46.    Nine States had now ratified the Constitution and it was to go into  effect among them. But the support of Virginia and New York was of so  much importance that their decisions were awaited with uneasiness. In  Virginia, in spite of the support of such men as Washington and Madison,  the sentiment for and against the Constitution was fairly evenly  divided, and the opposition numbered in its ranks other names of almost  equal influence, such as Patrick Henry and George Mason. Feeling ran  high; the contest was a bitter one and, even after the elections had  been held and the convention had opened, early in June, the decision was  in doubt and remained in doubt until the very end. The situation was,  in one respect at least, similar to that which had existed in  Massachusetts, in that it was possible to get a substantial majority  in favor of the Constitution provided certain amendments were made. The  same arguments were used; strengthened on the one side by what other  States had done, and on the other side by the plea that now was the time  to hold out for amendments. The example of Massachusetts, however, seems  to have been decisive, and on the 25th of June, four days later than  New Hampshire, the Virginia convention voted to ratify, \"under the  conviction that whatsoever imperfections may exist in the Constitution  ought rather to be examined in the mode prescribed therein, than  to bring the Union into danger by delay, with a hope of obtaining  amendments previous to the ratification.\"    When the New York convention began its sessions on the 17th of June, it  is said that more than two-thirds of the delegates were Anti-Federalist  in sentiment. How a majority in favor of the Constitution was obtained  has never been adequately explained, but it is certain that the main  credit for the achievement belongs to Alexander Hamilton. He had early  realized how greatly it would help the prospects of the Constitution if  thinking people could be brought to an appreciation of the importance  and value of the new form of government. In order to reach the  intelligent public everywhere, but particularly in New York, he  projected a series of essays which should be published in the  newspapers, setting forth the aims and purposes of the Constitution.  He secured the assistance of Madison and Jay, and before the end of  October, 1787, published the first essay in \"The Independent Gazetteer.\"  From that time on these papers continued to be printed over the  signature of \"Publius,\" sometimes as many as three or four in a week.  There were eighty-five numbers altogether, which have ever since been  known as \"The Federalist.\" Of these approximately fifty were the work of  Hamilton, Madison wrote about thirty and Jay five. Although the essays  were widely copied in other journals, and form for us the most important  commentary on the Constitution, making what is regarded as one of  America's greatest books, it is doubtful how much immediate influence  they had. Certainly in the New York convention itself Hamilton's  personal influence was a stronger force. His arguments were both  eloquent and cogent, and met every objection; and his efforts to win  over the opposition were unremitting. The news which came by express  riders from New Hampshire and then from Virginia were also deciding  factors, for New York could not afford to remain out of the new Union if  it was to embrace States on either side. And yet the debate continued,  as the opposition was putting forth every effort to make ratification  conditional upon certain amendments being adopted. But Hamilton  resolutely refused to make any concessions and at length was successful  in persuading the New York convention, by a vote of 30 against 27, on  the 26th of July, to follow the example of Massachusetts and Virginia  and to ratify the Constitution with merely a recommendation of future  amendments.    The satisfaction of the country at the outcome of the long and momentous  struggle over the adoption of the new government was unmistakable. Even  before the action of New York had been taken, the Fourth of July was  made the occasion for a great celebration throughout the United States,  both as the anniversary of independence and as the consummation of the  Union by the adoption of the Constitution.    The general rejoicing was somewhat tempered, however, by the reluctance  of North Carolina and Rhode Island to come under \"the new roof.\" Had  the convention which met on the 21st of July in North Carolina reached  a vote, it would probably have defeated the Constitution, but it was  doubtless restrained by the action of New York and adjourned without  coming to a decision. A second convention was called in September, 1789,  and in the meantime the new government had come into operation and was  bringing pressure to bear upon the recalcitrant States which refused to  abandon the old union for the new. One of the earliest acts passed by  Congress was a revenue act, levying duties upon foreign goods imported,  which were made specifically to apply to imports from Rhode Island and  North Carolina. This was sufficient for North Carolina, and on November  21, 1789, the convention ratified the Constitution. But Rhode Island  still held out. A convention of that State was finally called to meet  in March, 1790, but accomplished nothing and avoided a decision by  adjourning until May. The Federal Government then proceeded to threaten  drastic measures by taking up a bill which authorized the President to  suspend all commercial intercourse with Rhode Island and to demand of  that State the payment of its share of the Federal debt. The bill passed  the Senate but stopped there, for the State gave in and ratified the  Constitution on the 29th of May. Two weeks later Ellsworth, who was now  United States Senator from Connecticut, wrote that Rhode Island had been  \"brought into the Union, and by a pretty cold measure in Congress, which  would have exposed me to some censure, had it not produced the effect  which I expected it would and which in fact it has done. But 'all is  well that ends well.' The Constitution is now adopted by all the States  and I have much satisfaction, and perhaps some vanity, in seeing,  at length, a great work finished, for which I have long labored  incessantly.\"*            * \"Connecticut's Ratification of the Federal Constitution,\" by B.  C. Steiner, in \"Proceedings of the American Antiquarian Society,\" April  1915, pp. 88-89.    Perhaps the most striking feature of these conventions is the trivial  character of the objections that were raised. Some of the arguments  it is, true, went to the very heart of the matter and considered the  fundamental principles of government. It is possible to tolerate and  even to sympathize with a man who declared:    \"Among other deformities the Constitution has an awful squinting. It  squints toward monarchy;... your president may easily become a king....  If your American chief be a man of ambition and ability how easy it is  for him to render himself absolute. We shall have a king. The army will  salute him monarch.\"*            * \"Connecticut's Ratification of the Federal Constitution,\" by B.  C. Steiner, in \"Proceedings of the American Antiquarian Society,\" April  1915 pp. 88-89.      But it is hard to take seriously a delegate who asked permission \"to  make a short apostrophe to liberty,\" and then delivered himself of this  bathos:    \"O liberty!--thou greatest good--thou fairest property--with thee I wish  to live--with thee I wish to die!--Pardon me if I drop a tear on the  peril to which she"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3034"],[0,"The Anti-Slavery Crusade: A Chronicle of the Gathering Storm (#20)"],[1,"f's tent by night and inflicted a revolver wound in his back.  Though the citizens of Lawrence were greatly chagrined at this event and  offered a reward for the discovery of the assailant, the attack upon the  sheriff was made the signal for drastic procedure against the town of  Lawrence. A grand jury found indictments for treason against Reeder,  Robinson, and other leading citizens of the town. The United States  marshal gave notice that he expected resistance in making arrests  and called upon all law-abiding citizens of the Territory to aid in  executing the law. It was a welcome summons to the pro-slavery forces.  Not only local militia companies responded but also Buford's company  and various companies from Missouri, in all more than seven hundred men,  with two cannon. It had always been the set purpose of the free-state  men not to resist federal authority by force, unless as a last resort,  and they had no intention of opposing the marshal in making arrests. He  performed his duty without hindrance and then placed the armed troops  under the command of Sheriff Jones, who proceeded first to destroy the  printing-press of the town of Lawrence. Then, against the protest of the  marshal and Colonel Buford, the vindictive sheriff trained his guns upon  the new hotel which was the pride of the city; the ruin of the building  was made complete by fire, while a drunken mob pillaged the town.    On May 22, 1856, the day following the attack upon Lawrence, Charles  Sumner was struck down in the United States Senate on account of a  speech made in defense of the rights of Kansas settlers. The two events,  which were reported at the same time in the daily press, furnished  the key-note to the presidential campaign of that year, for nominating  conventions followed in a few days and \"bleeding Kansas\" was the  all-absorbing issue. In spite of the destruction of property in Lawrence  and the arrest of the leaders of the free-state party, Kansas had not  been plunged into a state of civil war. The free-state party had fired  no hostile shot. Governor Robinson and his associates still relied upon  public opinion and they accepted the wanton attack upon Lawrence as the  best assurance that they would yet win their cause by legal means.    A change, however, soon took place which is associated with the entrance  of John Brown into the history of Kansas. Brown and his sons were living  at Osawatomie, some thirty miles south of Lawrence. They were present at  the Wakarusa War in December, 1855, and were on their way to the defense  of Lawrence on May 21, 1856, when they were informed that the town had  been destroyed. Three days after this event Brown and his sons with two  or three others made a midnight raid upon their pro-slavery neighbors  living in the Pottawatomie valley and slew five men. The authors of this  deed were not certainly known until the publication of a confession of  one of the party in 1879, twenty years after the chief actor had won  the reputation of a martyr to the cause of liberty. The Browns, however,  were suspected at the time; warrants were out for their arrest; and  their homes were destroyed.    For more than three months after this incident, Kansas was in a state  of war; in fact, two distinct varieties of warfare were carried on.  Publicly organized companies on both sides engaged in acts of attack and  defense, while at the same time irresponsible secret bands were busy in  violent reprisals, in plunder and assassination. In both of these forms  of warfare, the free-state men proved themselves fully equal to their  opponents, and Governor Shannon was entirely unable to cope with the  situation. It is estimated that two hundred men were slain and two  million dollars' worth of property was destroyed.    The state of affairs in Kansas served to win many Northern Democrats  to the support of the Republicans. The Administration at Washington was  held responsible for the violence and bloodshed. The Democratic leaders  in the political campaign, determined now upon a complete change in  the Government of the Territory, appointed J. W. Geary as Governor and  placed General Smith in charge of the troops. The new incumbents, both  from Pennsylvania, entered upon their labors early in September, and  before the October state elections Geary was able to report that peace  reigned throughout the Territory. A prompt reaction in favor of the  Democrats followed. Buchanan, their presidential candidate, rejoiced in  the fact that order had been restored by two citizens of his own State.  It was now very generally conceded that Kansas would become a free  State, and intimate associates of Buchanan assured the public that he  was himself of that opinion and that if elected he would insure to the  free-state party evenhanded justice. Thousands of voters were thus won  to Buchanan's support. There was a general distrust of the Republican  candidate as a man lacking political experience, and a strong  conservative reaction against the idea of electing a President by the  votes of only one section of the country. At the election in November,  Buchanan received a majority of sixty of the electoral votes over  Fremont, but in the popular vote he fell short of a majority by nearly  400,000. Fillmore, candidate of the Whig and the American parties,  received 874,000 votes.    There was still profound distrust of the administration of the Territory  of Kansas, and the free-state settlers refused to vote at the election  set for the choosing of a new territorial Legislature in October.  The result was another pro-slavery assembly. Governor Geary, however,  determined to secure and enforce just treatment of both parties. He  was at once brought into violent conflict with the Legislature in an  experience which was almost an exact counterpart of that of Governor  Reeder; and Washington did not support his efforts to secure fair  dealings. A pro-slavery deputation visited President Pierce in February,  1857, and returned with the assurance that Governor Geary would be  removed. Without waiting for the President to act, Geary resigned in  disgust on the 4th of March. Of the three Governors whom President  Pierce appointed, two became active supporters of the free-state party  and a third, Governor Shannon, fled from the territory in mortal terror  lest he should be slain by members of the party which he had tried to  serve.        CHAPTER XI. CHARLES SUMNER    The real successor to John Quincy Adams as the protagonist of the  anti-slavery cause in Congress proved to be not Seward but Charles  Sumner of Massachusetts. This newcomer entered the Senate without  previous legislative experience but with an unusual equipment for  the role he was to play. A graduate of Harvard College at the age of  nineteen, he had entered upon the study of law in the newly organized  law school in which Joseph Story held one of the two professorships.  He was admitted to the bar in 1834, but three years later he left his  slender law practice for a long period of European travel. This three  years' sojourn brought him into intimate touch with the leading spirits  in arts, letters, and public life in England and on the Continent, and  thus ripened his talents to their full maturity. He returned to his  law practice poor in pocket but rich in the possession of lifelong  friendships and happy memories.    Sumner's political career did not begin until 1847, when as a Whig he  not only opposed any further extension of slavery but strove to commit  his party to the policy of emancipation in all the States. Failing in  this attempt, Sumner became an active Free-soiler in 1848. He was twice  a candidate for Congress on the Free-soil ticket but failed of election.  In 1851 he was elected to the United States Senate by a coalition  between his party and the Democrats. This is the only public office he  ever held, but he was continuously reelected until his death in 1874.    John Quincy Adams had addressed audiences trained in the old school,  which did not defend slavery on moral grounds. Charles Sumner faced  audiences of the new school, which upheld the institution as a righteous  moral order. This explains the chief difference in the attitude of the  two leaders. Sumner, like Adams, began as an opponent of pro-slavery  aggression, but he went farther: he attacked the institution itself as a  great moral evil.    As a constitutional lawyer Sumner is not the equal of his predecessor,  Daniel Webster. He is less original, less convincing in the enunciation  of broad general principles. He appears rather as a special pleader  marshaling all available forces against the one institution which  assailed the Union. In this particular work, he surpassed all others,  for, with his unbounded industry, he permitted no precedent, no legal  advantage, no incident of history, no fact in current politics fitted  to strengthen his cause, to escape his untiring search. He showed a  marvelous skill in the selection, arrangement, and presentation of  his materials, and for his models he took the highest forms of classic  forensic utterance.    Sumner exhibited the ordinary aloofness and lack of familiarity with  actual conditions in the South which was characteristic of the New  England abolitionist. He perceived no race problem, no peculiar  difficulty in the readjustments of master and slave which were involved  in emancipation, and he ignored all obstacles to the accomplishment of  his ends. Webster's arraignment of South Carolina was directed against  an alleged erroneous dogma and only incidentally affected personal  morality. The reaction, therefore, was void of bitter resentment.  Sumner's charges were directed against alleged moral turpitude, and  the classic form and scrupulous regard for parliamentary rules which he  observed only added to the feeling of personal resentment on the part of  his opponents. Some of the defenders of slavery were themselves "]]]
