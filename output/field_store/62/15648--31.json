Said one, \"O, we have to be familiar with the girls.  They all expect it, and would be offended if we were just friendly and  manifested no familiarities.\" Do you suppose girls ever thought of the  possibility of the young men saying that? When they are pleading for  permission to be familiar they do sometimes say, \"Why, all the girls  allow it,\" but they also add, \"so there can be no harm;\" while among  themselves they are laughing at the credulity of the girls, or  accusing them of making it necessary for the young men to take  \"innocent\" liberties in order to have the good will of the girls.    A young man may assure you most emphatically that he respects you none  the less, although you allow him to hold your hand or kiss you at  parting, but he knows it is not true, and he will admit it to others  rather than to the girl herself. Truthful young men say, \"Of course,  we have the most respect for the girls who keep us at a distance.\"  \"But they won't pay us attention,\" say the girls. \"Is that so?\" I  asked of a young man. \"Are you more earnest in pursuit of the girl who  courts approaches, or the girl who holds you at bay?\" \"Why!\" responded  he, with emphasis, \"the girls ought to know that a boy wants most that  which is hardest to get; but we are actually obliged to treat the  girls with familiarity or they won't go with us.\" And this young man  seemed really surprised when I assured him that girls supposed they  were obliged to accept caresses in order to have the attention of  young men. Then this same young man spoke of something that I know to  be too often true. He said, \"It is strange, if the girls don't want  these things, that they act as they do, for they actually invite  familiarity. In fact, many times I would have been glad to be  respectfully friendly, but the girls did not seem satisfied, and by  many little ways and manners they indicated that they were ready to be  caressed. I think they mean to be good girls, but they put an awful  lot of temptation in a fellow's way.\"    No doubt these girls did not realize what they were doing, but I  believe every young woman should have so clear an understanding of  human nature as to know that she is playing with a dangerous fire when  she allows caresses and unbecoming familiarity. She ought to know  that, while she may hold herself above criminal deeds, if she permits  fondlings and caresses she may be directly responsible for arousing a  passion in the young man that may lead him to go out from her presence  and seek the company of dissolute women, and thus lose his honor and  purity because a girl who called herself virtuous tempted him. Is she  in truth more honorable than the outcast woman? She has allowed  familiarities in the matter of embraces and kisses, and she may not  know what thoughts have been inspired in the mind of the young man by  her unguarded conduct. She may feel indignant at the suggestion,  because she has meant no harm, but in reality she should blush that  her own familiar conduct has given him a tacit right to think of her  with even greater freedom.    Girls have a wonderful responsibility in regard even to the moral  conduct of young men, and the self-respecting girl will guard herself  not only from the contamination of touch, but from an undue freedom of  thought.    Do you say she cannot govern the thoughts of men? I reply, she can to  a great extent. By a dress that exposes her person to public gaze, or  even more seductively hides it under a film of suggestive lace, she  has given a direction to the thoughts of those who look at her. She  has declared that their eyes may touch her, that their thoughts may be  occupied with an inventory of her physical charms. She has openly  announced that she is willing to be appraised by eyes of men as a  beautiful animal. What wonder if their thoughts go further than her  public declaration, and that they may freely surmise the charms that  still remain hidden?    When a girl, by putting herself into graceful attitudes in tempting  nearness to a young man, casts coquettish glances, she has done that  which will give a turn to the thought which may prove provocative of  deeds.    \"I am afraid of that girl,\" said a young man who desired to live  purely. \"May be she does not mean it, but her poses and glances make  it almost impossible for me to keep my hands off of her. I am obliged  to leave her for fear that I shall kiss her when she looks so  mischievously alluring.\"    The girl, perhaps, would have been flattered by the kiss and indignant  at further liberties, yet would have felt no compunctions had her  victim been inflamed by a passion that he lacked the power to control,  prompting him to seek some other girl to be his prey.    You think men should have self-control. So they should. We will not  lessen the blame of the young man, but the girl who puts the  temptation in his way, even if she did not herself yield to it, is not  guiltless.    The conduct of a pure woman should be the safeguard and not the  destruction of a man, and she can be his protector, even as he is  hers. I heard an eminent woman say that woman was man's moral  protector, and man woman's physical protector, and I said that is only  half true. Man is also woman's moral protector, and woman is also  man's physical protector. She is acknowledged to be his physical  tempter. If she knows her power she can, by her wise, modest, womanly  demeanor, make it impossible for him to feel an impure impulse in her  presence. Ruskin says:    \"You cannot think that the buckling on of the knight's armor by his  lady's hand was a mere caprice of romantic fashion. It is the type of  an eternal truth--that the soul's armor is never well set to the heart  unless a woman's hand has braced it; and it is only when she braces it  loosely that the honor of manhood fails. Know you not those lovely  lines--I would they were learned by all youthful ladies of England--        \"'Ah wasteful woman! she who may        On her sweet self set her own price,      Knowing he cannot choose but pay--        How has she cheapen'd Paradise!      How given for nought her priceless gift,        How spoiled the bread and spill'd the wine,      Which, spent with due, respective thrift,        Had made brutes men, and men divine!'\"          CHAPTER XXI.    FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN BOYS AND GIRLS.      You might like to know, dear reader, if I do not believe in some  intermediate relation between that of the comrade and the lover--a  more intimate relation than the one and less intimate than the other.  You ask, Cannot a young man and a young woman be real, true friends?    Let us talk a little about friendship and what it implies. I should  define a friend as one who believes in me, who expects much of me, who  encourages me to do the best that is in me, who will tell me of my  faults, who recognizes my virtues, who trusts in my honor.    You are willing to accept that definition, and you think it possible  to be all that to each other without being lovers. I believe it, too,  but I would like to make some further statements before we have the  discussion of this question.    I believe that a girl's first and best friends are her parents; her  wisest _confidante_, her mother. To these she may speak unreservedly  of herself. With these she may freely talk over family matters. In a  friendship with some outside the family it would be unwise to discuss  family matters. It might be an unkindness to other members of the  family, and in case of a break in the friendship the family secrets  might be betrayed, and to the detriment of the trusting friend. I once  read of such an affair, where one girl had confided to another certain  matters that reflected on the honor of her family, and when the  friendship was broken the secret was betrayed, to the public shame of  the girl who had been unwise in her confidences.    True honor would forbid the betrayal of a confidence even after the  rupture of a friendship; but all persons have not the highest ideal of  honor. If the girl is not discreet in her revelation of herself, and  her mother is her only _confidante_, it will not be so serious a  matter, for the mother will never be tempted to reveal to others  anything that would bring scorn or criticism upon her child. Nowhere,  in her girlish ignorance, can the girl find as sincere sympathy as in  the loving mother.    \"But all mothers are not sympathetic,\" you say. \"They are often  nagging, and use the confidences of the daughter to make her  uncomfortable.\" Well, if this be so, you, at least, can learn the  lesson, and by your habits of thought fit yourself to be the wise,  loving, companionable, sympathetic _confidante_ of your daughter, for  you will be anxious that she should have no friend so close as  yourself.    However, I believe that mothers should recognize the individuality of  their daughters, and win, rather than command, confidence. It is  difficult for us, as mothers, to realize that our daughter is just as  much a separate individual as is our neighbor's daughter, and that we  have no right to thrust ourselves upon her, no right to demand that  she shall love us. We have the right to sympathize, to counsel, to  direct her conduct so long as she remains in our personal care, but we  should remember that she must be responsible, that she is a soul and  must live her own life, learn her own lessons, suffer her own  experiences. Our deepest love can only enable us to help her to choose  wisely, to think truly, to act judiciously. So I would have the  friendship of mother and daughter something very deep and  true--something more than a petting and caressing, an indulging or  humoring.    I would be inclined to have less outward demonstration and more inner  tenderness. I believe that very often outward impression comes largely  to take the place of true affection.

B. II. ch. 7. sect. 3; I cannot certainly say. If so,  this might tempt Rebeka to contrive, and Jacob to put this imposition  upon him. However, Josephus says here, that it was Isaac, and not  Rebeka, who inquired of God at first, and received the forementioned  oracle, sect. 1; which, if it be the true reading, renders Isaac's  procedure more inexcusable.

Jacob therefore by obtaining this blessing of the  first-born, became the genuine heir of that kingdom, in opposition to  Esau.]      35 (return) [ Here we have the difference between slaves for life and  servants, such as we now hire for a time agreed upon on both sides, and  dismiss again after he time contracted for is over, which are no slaves,  but free men and free women.

As  for Benjamin, as commonly explained, the son of the right hand, it makes  no sense at all, and seems to be a gross modern error only. The  Samaritan always writes this name truly Benjamin, which probably is here  of the same signification, only with the Chaldee termination in, instead  of im in the Hebrew; as we pronounce cherubin or cherubim indifferently.  Accordingly, both the Testament of Benjamin, sect. 2, p. 401, and Philo  de Nominum Mutatione, p. 1059, write the name Benjamin, but explain it  not the son of the right hand, but the son of days.]              BOOK II. Containing The Interval Of Two Hundred And Twenty Years.From  The Death Of Isaac To The Exodus Out Of Egypt.              CHAPTER 1. How Esau And Jacob, Isaac's Sons Divided Their Habitation;  And Esau Possessed Idumea And Jacob Canaan.    1. After the death of Isaac, his sons divided their habitations  respectively; nor did they retain what they had before; but Esau  departed from the city of Hebron, and left it to his brother, and dwelt  in Seir, and ruled over Idumea. He called the country by that name from  himself, for he was named Adom; which appellation he got on the  following occasion:One day returning from the toil of hunting very  hungry, [it was when he was a child in age,] he lighted on his brother  when he was getting ready lentile-pottage for his dinner, which was of a  very red color; on which account he the more earnestly longed for it,  and desired him to give him some of it to eat: but he made advantage of  his brother's hunger, and forced him to resign up to him his birthright;  and he, being pinched with famine, resigned it up to him, under an oath.  Whence it came, that, on account of the redness of this pottage, he was,  in way of jest, by his contemporaries, called Adom, for the Hebrews call  what is red Adom; and this was the name given to the country; but the  Greeks gave it a more agreeable pronunciation, and named it Idumea.    2. He became the father of five sons; of whom Jaus, and Jalomus, and  Coreus, were by one wife, whose name was Alibama; but of the rest,  Aliphaz was born to him by Ada, and Raguel by Basemmath: and these were  the sons of Esau. Aliphaz had five legitimate sons; Theman, Omer,  Saphus, Gotham, and Kanaz; for Amalek was not legitimate, but by a  concubine, whose name was Thamna. These dwelt in that part of Idumea  which is called Gebalitis, and that denominated from Amalek, Amalekitis;  for Idumea was a large country, and did then preserve the name of the  whole, while in its several parts it kept the names of its peculiar  inhabitants.              CHAPTER 2. How Joseph, The Youngest Of Jacob's Sons, Was Envied By His  Brethren, When Certain Dreams Had Foreshown His Future Happiness.    1. It happened that Jacob came to so great happiness as rarely any other  person had arrived at. He was richer than the rest of the inhabitants of  that country; and was at once envied and admired for such virtuous sons,  for they were deficient in nothing, but were of great souls, both for  laboring with their hands and enduring of toil; and shrewd also in  understanding. And God exercised such a providence over him, and such a  care of his happiness, as to bring him the greatest blessings, even out  of what appeared to be the most sorrowful condition; and to make him the  cause of our forefathers' departure out of Egypt, him and his posterity.  The occasion was this:When Jacob had his son Joseph born to him by  Rachel, his father loved him above the rest of his sons, both because of  the beauty of his body, and the virtues of his mind, for he excelled the  rest in prudence. This affection of his father excited the envy and the  hatred of his brethren; as did also his dreams which he saw, and related  to his father, and to them, which foretold his future happiness, it  being usual with mankind to envy their very nearest relations such their  prosperity. Now the visions which Joseph saw in his sleep were these:    2. When they were in the middle of harvest, and Joseph was sent by his  father, with his brethren, to gather the fruits of the earth, he saw a  vision in a dream, but greatly exceeding the customary appearances that  come when we are asleep; which, when he was got up, he told his  brethren, that they might judge what it portended. He said, he saw the  last night, that his wheat-sheaf stood still in the place where he set  it, but that their sheaves ran to bow down to it, as servants bow down  to their masters. But as soon as they perceived the vision foretold that  he should obtain power and great wealth, and that his power should be in  opposition to them, they gave no interpretation of it to Joseph, as if  the dream were not by them understood: but they prayed that no part of  what they suspected to be its meaning might come to pass; and they bare  a still greater hatred to him on that account.    3. But God, in opposition to their envy, sent a second vision to Joseph,  which was much more wonderful than the former; for it seemed to him that  the sun took with him the moon, and the rest of the stars, and came down  to the earth, and bowed down to him. He told the vision to his father,  and that, as suspecting nothing of ill-will from his brethren, when they  were there also, and desired him to interpret what it should signify.  Now Jacob was pleased with the dream: for, considering the prediction in  his mind, and shrewdly and wisely guessing at its meaning, he rejoiced  at the great things thereby signified, because it declared the future  happiness of his son; and that, by the blessing of God, the time would  come when he should be honored, and thought worthy of worship by his  parents and brethren, as guessing that the moon and sun were like his  mother and father; the former, as she that gave increase and nourishment  to all things; and the latter, he that gave form and other powers to  them; and that the stars were like his brethren, since they were eleven  in number, as were the stars that receive their power from the sun and  moon.    4. And thus did Jacob make a judgment of this vision, and that a shrewd  one also. But these interpretations caused very great grief to Joseph's  brethren; and they were affected to him hereupon as if he were a certain  stranger, that was to those good things which were signified by the  dreams and not as one that"]]]
