They ate an early supper, and, hardly had the dishes been put away,  when from the west, where there was a low-flying bank of clouds, there  came a mutter of thunder. A little later there was a dull, red  illumination amid the rolling masses of vapor.    \"There's the storm, and she's heading right this way,\" commented Mr.  Sharp.    \"Can't you avoid it?\" asked Mr. Damon, anxiously.    \"I could, if I knew how high it was, but I guess we'll wait and see how  it looks as we get closer.\"    The airship was flying on, and the storm, driven by a mighty wind, was  rushing to meet it. Already there was a sighing, moaning sound in the  wire and wooden braces of the Red Cloud.    Suddenly there came such a blast that it heeled the ship over on her  side.    \"Shift the equilibrium rudders!\" shouted Mr. Sharp to Tom, turning the  wheel and various levers over to the lad. \"I'm going to get more speed  out of the motor!\"    Tom acted just in time, and, after bobbing about like a cork on the  water, the ship was righted, and sent forging ahead, under the  influence of the propellers worked at top speed. Nor was this any too  much, for it needed all the power of the big engine to even partially  overcome the force of the wind that was blowing right against the Red  Cloud. Of course they might have turned and flown before it, but they  wanted to go north, not south--they wanted to face their accusers.    Then, after the first fury of the blast had spent itself, there came a  deluge of rain, following a dazzling glare of lightning and a bursting  crash of thunder.    In spite of the gale buffeting her, the airship was making good  progress. The skill of Tom and the balloonist was never shown to better  advantage. All around them the storm raged, but through it the craft  kept on her way. Nothing could be seen but pelting sheets of water and  swirling mist, yet onward the ship was driven.    The thunder was deafening, and the lightning nearly blinded them, until  the electrics were switched on, flooding the cabin with radiance.  Inside the car they were snug and dry, though the pitching of the craft  was like that of a big liner in the trough of the ocean waves.    \"Will she weather it, do you think?\" called Mr. Damon, in the ear of  Mr. Sharp, shouting so as to be heard above the noise of the elements,  and the hum of the motor.    The balloonist nodded.    \"She's a good ship,\" he answered proudly.    Hardly had he spoken when there came a crash louder than any that had  preceded, and the flash of rosy light that accompanied it seemed to set  the whole heavens on fire. At the same time there was violent shock to  the ship.    \"We're hit! Struck by lightning!\" yelled Tom.    \"We're falling!\" cried Mr. Damon an instant later.    Mr. Sharp looked at the elevation gauge. The hand was slowly swinging  around. Down, down dropped the Red Cloud. She was being roughly treated  by the storm.    \"I'm afraid we're wrecked!\" said the balloonist in a low voice,  scarcely audible above the roar of the tempest. Following the great  crash had come a comparatively light bombardment from the sky artillery.    \"Use the gliding rudder, Tom,\" called Mr. Sharp, a moment later. \"We  may fall, but we'll land as easily as possible.\"    The wind, the rain, the lightning and thunder continued. Down, down  sank the ship. Its fall was somewhat checked by the rudder Tom swung  into place, and by setting the planes at a different angle. The motor  had been stopped, and the propellers no longer revolved. In the  confusion and darkness it was not safe to run ahead, with the danger of  colliding with unseen objects on the earth.    They tried to peer from the windows, but could see nothing. A moment  later, as they stared at each other with fear in their eyes, there came  a shock. The ship trembled from end to end.    \"We've landed!\" cried Tom, as he yanked back on the levers. The airship  came to a stop.    \"Now to see where we are,\" said Mr. Sharp grimly, \"and how badly we are  wrecked.\"          Chapter 20    Tom Gets A Clue      Out of the cabin of the now stationary airship hurried the three  travelers; out into the pelting rain, which was lashed into their faces  by the strong wind. Tom was the first to emerge.    \"We're on something solid!\" he cried, stamping his feet. \"A rock, I  guess.\"    \"Gracious, I hope we're not on a rock in the midst of a river!\"  exclaimed Mr. Damon. \"Bless my soul, though! The water does seem to be  running around my ankles.\"    \"There's enough rain to make water run almost up to our necks,\" called  Mr. Sharp, above the noise of the storm. \"Tom, can you make out where  we are?\"    \"Not exactly. Is the ship all right?\"    \"I can't see very well, but there appears to be a hole in the gas  container. A big one, too, or we wouldn't have fallen so quickly.\"    The plight of the travelers of the air was anything but enviable. They  were wet through, for it needed only a few minutes exposure to the  pelting storm to bring this about. They could not tell, in the midst of  the darkness, where they were, and they almost feared to move for fear  they might be on top of some rock or precipice, over which they might  tumble if they took a false step.    \"Let's get back inside the ship,\" proposed Mr. Damon. \"It's warm and  dry there, at all events. Bless my umbrella, I don't know when I've  been so wet!\"    \"I'm not going in until I find out where we are,\" declared Tom. \"Wait a  minute, and I'll go in and get an electric flash lantern. That will  show us,\" for the lightning had ceased with the great crash that seemed  to have wrecked the Red Cloud. The rain still kept up, however, and  there was a distant muttering of thunder, while it was so black that  had not the lights in the cabin of the airship been faintly glowing  they could hardly have found the craft had they moved ten feet away  from it.    Tom soon returned with the portable electric lamp, operated by dry  batteries. He flashed it on the surface of where they were standing,  and uttered an exclamation.    \"We're on a roof!\" he cried.    \"A roof?\" repeated Mr. Damon.    \"Yes; the roof of some large building, and what you thought was a river  is the rain water running off it. See!\"    The young inventor held the light down so his companions could observe  the surface of that upon which the airship rested. There was no doubt  of it. They were on top of a large building.    \"If we're on a roof we must be in the midst of a city,\" objected Mr.  Damon. \"But I can't see any lights around, and we would see them if we  were in a city, you know.\"    \"Maybe the storm put the lights out of business,\" suggested Mr. Sharp.  \"That often occurs.\"    \"I know one way we can find out for certain,\" went on Tom.    \"How?\"    \"Start up our search lamp, and play it all around. We can't make sure  how large this roof is in the dark, and it's risky trying to trace the  edges by walking around.\"    \"Yes, and it would be risky to start our searchlight going,\" objected  Mr. Sharp. \"People would see it, and there'd be a crowd up here in less  than no time, storm or no storm. No, we've got to keep dark until I can  see what's the matter. We must leave here before daylight.\"    \"Suppose we can't?\" asked Mr. Damon. \"The crowds will be sure to see us  then, anyhow.\"    \"I am pretty sure we can get away,\" was the opinion of the balloonist.  \"Even if our gas container is so damaged that it will not sustain us,  we are still an aeroplane, and this roof being flat will make a good  place to start from. No, we can leave as soon as this storm lets up a  little.\"    \"Then I'm going to have a look and find out what sort of a building  this is,\" declared Tom, and, while Mr. Sharp began a survey, as well as  he could in the dark, of the airship, the young inventor proceeded  cautiously to ascertain the extent of the roof.    The rain was not coming down quite so hard now, and Tom found it easier  to see. Mr. Damon, finding he could do nothing to help, went back into  the cabin, blessing himself and his various possessions at the queer  predicament in which they found themselves.    Flashing his light every few seconds, Tom walked on until he came to  one edge of the roof. It was very large, as he could judge by the time  it took him to traverse it. There was a low parapet at the edge. He  peered over, and an expanse of dark wall met his eyes.    \"Must have come to one side,\" he reasoned. \"I want to get to the front.  Then, maybe, I can see a sign that will tell me what I want to know.\"    The lad turned to the left, and, presently came to another parapet. It  was higher, and ornamented with terra-cotta bricks. This, evidently,  was the front. As Tom peered over the edge of the little raised ledge,  there flashed out below him hundreds of electric lights. The city  illuminating plant was being repaired. Then Tom saw flashing below him  one of those large signs made of incandescent lights. It was in front  of the building, and as soon as our hero saw the words he knew where  the airship had landed. For what he read, as he leaned over, was this:        MIDDLEVILLE ARCADE        Tom gave a cry.    \"What's the matter?\" called Mr. Sharp.    \"I've discovered something,\" answered Tom, hurrying up to his friend.  \"We're on top of the Middleville Arcade building.\"    \"What does that mean?\"    \"It means that we're not so very far from home, and in the midst of a  fairly large city. But it means more than that.\"    \"What?\" demanded the balloonist, struck by an air of excitement about  the lad, for, as Tom stood in the subdued glow of the lights from one  of the airship's cabin windows, all the others having been darkened as  the storm slackened, his, eyes shone brightly.    \"This is the building where Anson Morse, one of the gang that robbed  dad, once had an office,\" went on Tom eagerly. \"That was brought out at  the trial. And it's the place where they used to do some of their  conspiring."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3008"],[0,"The Jargon File, Version 4.2.2, 20 Aug 2000 (#20)"],[1,"to test device drivers, and writing     the assemblers that will be used to write the compiler back ends that     will give the new machine a real development environment. 2.     `Programming on the bare metal' is also used to describe a style of     [1105]hand-hacking that relies on bit-level peculiarities of a     particular hardware design, esp. tricks for speed and space     optimization that rely on crocks such as overlapping instructions (or,     as in the famous case described in [1106]The Story of Mel (in Appendix     A), interleaving of opcodes on a magnetic drum to minimize fetch     delays due to the device's rotational latency). This sort of thing has     become less common as the relative costs of programming time and     machine resources have changed, but is still found in heavily     constrained environments such as industrial embedded systems, and in     the code of hackers who just can't let go of that low-level control.     See [1107]Real Programmer.       In the world of personal computing, bare metal programming (especially     in sense 1 but sometimes also in sense 2) is often considered a     [1108]Good Thing, or at least a necessary evil (because these machines     have often been sufficiently slow and poorly designed to make it     necessary; see [1109]ill-behaved). There, the term usually refers to     bypassing the BIOS or OS interface and writing the application to     directly access device registers and machine addresses. \"To get 19.2     kilobaud on the serial port, you need to get down to the bare metal.\"     People who can do this sort of thing well are held in high regard.       _________________________________________________________________       Node:barf, Next:[1110]barfmail, Previous:[1111]bare metal, Up:[1112]=     B =       barf /barf/ n.,v.

To say     \"Barf!\" or emit some similar expression of disgust. \"I showed him my     latest hack and he barfed\" means only that he complained about it, not     that he literally vomited. 3. vi. To fail to work because of     unacceptable input, perhaps with a suitable error message, perhaps     not. Examples: \"The division operation barfs if you try to divide by     0.\" (That is, the division operation checks for an attempt to divide     by zero, and if one is encountered it causes the operation to fail in     some unspecified, but generally obvious, manner.) \"The text editor     barfs if you try to read in a new file before writing out the old     one.\" See [1114]choke, [1115]gag. In Commonwealth Hackish, `barf' is     generally replaced by `puke' or `vom'.

Upon experimenting, they discovered the     interactions were far more probable than expected; the nuclei were `as     big as a barn'. The units for cross-sections were christened Barns,     (10^-24 cm^2) and the book containing cross-sections has a picture of     a barn on the cover.       _________________________________________________________________       Node:barney, Next:[1134]baroque, Previous:[1135]barn, Up:[1136]= B =       barney n.

A programming language, originally designed for Dartmouth's     experimental timesharing system in the early 1960s, which for many     years was the leading cause of brain damage in proto-hackers. Edsger     W. Dijkstra observed in \"Selected Writings on Computing: A Personal     Perspective\" that \"It is practically impossible to teach good     programming style to students that have had prior exposure to BASIC:     as potential programmers they are mentally mutilated beyond hope of     regeneration.\" This is another case (like [1149]Pascal) of the     cascading [1150]lossage that happens when a language deliberately     designed as an educational toy gets taken too seriously. A novice can     write short BASIC programs (on the order of 10-20 lines) very easily;     writing anything longer (a) is very painful, and (b) encourages bad     habits that will make it harder to use more powerful languages well.     This wouldn't be so bad if historical accidents hadn't made BASIC so     common on low-end micros in the 1980s. As it is, it probably ruined     tens of thousands of potential wizards.       [1995: Some languages called `BASIC' aren't quite this nasty any more,     having acquired Pascal- and C-like procedures and control structures     and shed their line numbers. --ESR]       Note: the name is commonly parsed as Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic     Instruction Code, but this is a [1151]backronym. BASIC was originally     named Basic, simply because it was a simple and basic programming     language. Because most programming language names were in fact     acronyms, BASIC was often capitalized just out of habit or to be     silly. No acronym for BASIC originally existed or was intended (as one     can verify by reading texts through the early 1970s). Later, around     the mid-1970s, people began to make up backronyms for BASIC because     they weren't sure. Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code is     the one that caught on.       _________________________________________________________________       Node:batbelt, Next:[1152]batch, Previous:[1153]BASIC, Up:[1154]= B =       batbelt n.       Many hackers routinely hang numerous devices such as pagers,     cell-phones, personal organizers, leatherman multitools, pocket     knives, flashlights, walkie-talkies, even miniature computers from     their belts. When many of these devices are worn at once, the hacker's     belt somewhat resembles Batman's utility belt; hence it is referred to     as a batbelt.       _________________________________________________________________       Node:batch, Next:[1155]bathtub curve, Previous:[1156]batbelt,     Up:[1157]= B =       batch adj.       1. Non-interactive. Hackers use this somewhat more loosely than the     traditional technical definitions justify; in particular, switches on     a normally interactive program that prepare it to receive     non-interactive command input are often referred to as `batch mode'     switches. A `batch file' is a series of instructions written to be     handed to an interactive program running in batch mode. 2.
