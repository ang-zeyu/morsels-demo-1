Our some'in to eat wuz well fixed an' cooked. We  caught a lot o' 'possums, coons an' other game, but I tell yer a coon  is a lot harder to ketch den a possum. We had one garden, an' de  colored people tended the garden, an' we all et out'n it.    \"Dere wuz about 2000 acres in de plantation. All de farm lan' wuz  fenced in wid wood rails. De hogs, cows an' stock wuz turned out in de  woods, an' let go. The cows wuz drived home at night, dat is if dey  didn't come up. Dat is so we could milk de ones we wanted ter milk.    \"We dug ditches to drain de lan', blin' ditches; we dug 'em an' den put  poles on top, an' covered 'em wid brush an' dirt. We put de brush on de  poles to keep de dirt from runnin' through. Den we ploughed over de  ditches.    \"We tanned our leather in a tan trough. We used white oak bark an' red  oak bark. Dey put copperas in it too, I think.    \"I knows how to raise flax. You grow it an' when it is grown you pull  it clean up out of de groun' till it kinder rots. Dey have what dey  called a brake, den it wuz broke up in dat. De bark wuz de flax. Dey  had a stick called a swingle stick, made kinder like a sword. Dey used  dis to knock de sticks out o' de flax. Dey would den put de flax on a  hackle, a board wid a lot of pegs in it. Den dey clean an' string it  out till it looks lak your hair. Dey flax when it came from de hackles  wuz ready for de wheel whur it wuz spun into thread. I tell you, you  couldn't break it either.    \"When it wuz spun into thread dey put it on a reel. It turned 100 times  and struck, when it struck it wuz called a cut. When it come from de  wheel it wuz called a broach. De cuts stood fer so much flax. So many  cuts made a yard, but dere wuz more ter do, size it, and hank it before  it wuz weaved. Most of the white people had flax clothes.    \"We had no church on de plantation. We had prayer meetin' an' candy  pullin's, an' we would ask slaves from udder plantations. My master had  no public corn shuckin's. His slaves shucked his corn. He had about 50  head. De slaves dey went to de white folks church. Dey had a place  separate from de white folks by a railin'. We could look at de preacher  an' hear him preach too.    \"No, sirree, dey wouldn't let us have no books. Dey would not let none  o' de chilluns tell us anything about a book. I cain't read an' write,  not a bit. Dey preached ter us to obey our master. Preacher John  Ellington wuz my favorite preacher. No nigger wuz allowed ter preach.  Dey wuz allowed ter pray and shout sometimes, but dey better not be  ketched wid a book. De songs dat dey sung den, dey hardly ever sing 'em  now. Dey were de good ole songs. 'Hark from de tomb de doleful sound'.  'My years are tender,' 'Cry, You livin' man,' 'Come view dis groun'  where we must shortly lie'.    \"No one ran away from our plantation, but dey did from some other  plantations. When some o' de niggers were carried by their masters to  wait on 'em as servants up no'th, some o' de other people would see how  dey were treated an' git 'em to run away. When dere master started home  dey couldn't find 'em. Dey took and educated 'em and made women an' men  out'en 'em.    \"We visited at night during slavery time. De men went courtin'. When a  man, a slave, loved a 'oman on another plantation dey axed der master,  sometimes de master would ax de other master. If dey agreed all de  slave man an' 'oman had ter de [HW: do] Sa'dy night wuz fer him to come  over an' dey would go to bed together. Dere wuz no marriage--until  atter de surrender. All who wanted to keep de same 'oman atter de  surrender had to pay 25c fer er marriage license, den $1.50, den $3.00.  If de magistrate married you, you didn't have to pay anything, less he  charged you.    \"We got de holidays, Christmas, and atter lay-by-time o' de crops. Dey  had big dinners den. Dey had big tables set in de yard, de rations wuz  spread on 'em, an' everybody et. We had brandy at Christmas.    \"I have been whupped twice, an' I have seen slaves whupped. Ha! Ha!  missus whupped me. She wouldn't let nobody else whup me neither. I  'members what it wuz about as if it wuz yesterday. She wuz fretted  'bout de cook. We wuz skinnin' i'sh taters. She tole us to make haste,  if we didn't make haste an' peel de taters she would whack us down. I  laughed, she sent me to git a switch. She hit me on de legs. When we  were whupped we would say, 'oh! pray,' and dey would quit. If you acted  stubborn dey would whup you more. She axed me, 'ain't you gwine ter say  'oh! pray?' I wuz mad. She wuz not hurtin' me much, an' I wouldn't say  nuthin'. Atter awhile I said, 'oh! pray', an' she quit. I had good  owners all o' dem. My masters never did hit me. Missus would not whup  me much. She jes wanted ter show off sometimes.    \"We had good doctors when we got sick. I 'members Dr. James o' Clayton  comin' to our house. Dey carried dere pills an' medicine den, an' lef'  it at de house fer you.    \"My master had a son in de war, Walter Pool. He wuz a footso'dier at  first. He got sick an' he come home sick on er furlough. He hired er  man to go in his place at first, den de man went. Atter awhile de men  got so skurce, he had to go agin; den he got de chance to go in de  cavalry. Ole master bought him a horse, an' he could ride nex' time. He  belonged to the 1st. Ga. Reg. 2nd Cavalry Gen. Dange's Brigade, C. Co.  N.C. Volunteers.    \"I saw de Confederates' General Johnson come through Clayton, an' de  Yankees come de 2nd [HW: second] day atter dey come through. I think I  seed enough Yankees come through dere to whup anything on God's earth.  De Yankees camped three miles from our plantation at Mrs. Widow Sarah  Saunders across White Oak Creek on de Averysboro road. Her son, Capt.  Ed. Saunders wuz in de Confederate Army. She wuz a big slave owner. She  had about 100 slaves. She wuz called a rich 'oman.    \"De Yankees played songs o' walkin' de streets of Baltimore an' walkin'  in Maryland. Dey really played it. Dey slaughtered cows and sometimes  only et de liver. I went to de camp atter dey lef' an' it wuz de  awfulest stink I ever smelt in my life. Dey lef' dem cows part o' 'em  lying whur dey were in de camp. Dey killed geese an' chickens, an'  skinned 'em. Sometimes dey skinned de hind quarters uv a cow, cut 'em  off an' lef' de res'.    \"When dey tole me I wuz free I didn't notice it, I stayed on and worked  jest lak I had been doin', right on wid missus and master. I stayed  dere a year atter de surrender.    \"I dunno what ter think o' Abraham Lincoln. Dey said he wuz all right.  I guess he wuz a man God loved, er all right man. I think some o' de  slaves wuz better off when dey had owners and wuz in slavery den dey is  now. De colored people are slaves now more den dey wuz den. I can show  you wherein de nigger's got all his expenses ter bear now. He gits his  pay out'en de white man and de white man don't pay him much. De nigger  in de South is jest as much a slave as ever. De nigger now is a better  slave den when dey owned him, 'cause he has his own expenses to bear.  If you works a horse an' doan have him ter feed, you is better off, dan  if you had ter feed and care fer him. Dat is de way dat thing is now.    \"I seed many patterollers durin' slavery. If dey caught you out at  night without a pass dey would whup you.    \"I think Mr. Roosevelt is a mighty nice man. He has done me a lot o'  good. No man can make times real good till everybody is put to work.  Wid de lan' lyin' out dere can't be real good times. Dis is my  'lustration. My horse died las' year. I ain't got no money ter buy  nother and can't git one. You see dat lan' lyin' out dere I have farmed  it every year fer a long time. Through part o' de year I always had  vegetables and sich ter sell, but now my horse is dead an' I can't farm  no more. I ain't got nothin' ter sell. I is bad out o' heart.

Soldiers' rations of coarse groceries were  served out from the Society's stores, but everything else must be bought  out of his slender income--L50 if a married man (unordained), or L30 if  a bachelor. Often in the earlier days, while the Maoris were still  unfriendly, even pork and potatoes were not to be had. More than once  Henry Williams and his family were brought to the verge of starvation.    [Illustration: OLD CHURCH AT RUSSELL (Built in 1838).]    In spite of these and other privations, the health of the missionaries  was good and their families were large. No death occurred among them  until 1837, when Mrs. R. Davis was called to her rest. Dangers abounded  on every hand, yet accidents were rare. Mr. and Mrs. Charles Davis were  lost at sea; Marsden was wrecked on the Brampton reef, but escaped  unhurt with all his party. Henry Williams passed through a terrible  experience when returning from Tauranga in 1832. For two days his little  vessel had been enveloped in driving rain and had been blown quite out  of her course, when the missionary, who had been praying through the  whole night, seeing at daybreak a rock immediately ahead, fell back upon  his old nautical skill, seized the tiller in his own hands, and just  succeeded in saving the craft from destruction.    It was this imminent peril that raised in the mind of Henry Williams the  question of how to make provision for his numerous family in case of his  death. Like most of his colleagues, he had sons growing to manhood, and  was anxious to do his duty by them. He could have sent them to England,  but this would have meant a life-long separation between parents and  children; to Sydney, but this would involve their exposure to the  temptations of a convict settlement. He therefore decided to buy some  land near to Paihia, and on this to settle his sons. The Maoris were  pleased to sell him the land, and the Home Committee approved of the  scheme. Several of the other missionaries did likewise. The plan seems a  reasonable one, and it received the approbation of Bishop Broughton, on  the condition that the lands so obtained should be strictly devoted to  the use of the children, and not to that of their parents. But it has  brought upon the missionary body, and upon Henry Williams in particular,  the reproach of land-speculating--a reproach which is still reiterated  by modern historians such as Saunders and Collier. Fortunately, an  incident occurred at the close of our period which is enough to furnish  a decisive test, at least in the case of Henry Williams.    One of the first acts of Governor Hobson was to seek for a site for the  capital of the new Colony. Wellington was vetoed by the Home Government,  and the only other European town was Kororareka in the Bay of Islands.  In this place or its neighbourhood the governor would doubtless have  fixed his headquarters, had it not been for Henry Williams. This  sagacious man had long noted the magnificent possibilities of the  Waitemata Harbour, and on being asked his advice he took the governor to  the spot. Hobson at once saw the value of the position, and selected the  place where the city of Auckland was soon to rise. But before he could  buy the land from its Maori possessors, he was disabled by a stroke of  illness, and returned invalided to find nursing and medical attention at  the mission station of Waimate. During the period of his convalescence  he fixed his abode at Russell--a house just opposite to Paihia--and the  Auckland scheme was left in abeyance. Speculators were busy about other  suggested localities in the Bay of Islands, but the real site was known  only to Henry Williams and to the governor himself.    What a chance was here for a speculator! Never, perhaps, before or  since, has such an opportunity occurred. Williams, with his unrivalled  influence over the Maoris, might have bought up large tracts of land  near the new site. If the charges against him are true, this is what he  would have done. As a matter of fact, _he never acquired a single acre  of land in that district_. He suffered the seat of government to be  removed a hundred miles away from his own doors to a place where he did  not possess, or try to possess, a single foot. This fact should surely  set at rest for ever the question of the disinterestedness of Henry  Williams.    Land-buying was not the only fault of which the missionaries were  accused. An English artist, Earle, visited New Zealand in 1827, and on  his return published an account of his travels, in which he accused the  church clergy of churlishness and inhospitality. Yet these same men were  the ones who came to his assistance when his house was burned, and  supplied all his wants to the full. This fact Mr. Earle does not  mention, and has not a favourable word to say on behalf of those who had  befriended him.    A very different visitor arrived some eight years later in the  research-vessel _Beagle_. This was Charles Darwin, whose name had not  yet achieved renown, but who was already distinguished for that  philosophical temperament and keen observation which make his judgment  to be of exceptional value. He speaks of \"the gentlemanlike, useful, and  upright characters\" of the missionaries; expresses his admiration of the  civilised appearance of Waimate; and finds in the results thus achieved  the best ground for hope for the future of the country. He had evidently  been previously impressed by Earle's denunciations, and was even  surprised to see one of the missionaries' sons playing cricket with the  Maori scholars. The mention of this little incident was doubtless  intended to soften the impression of extreme austerity, and is not  without its value to this end. But it does not go very far to modify the  picture of old-fashioned gravity and severity. In modern times the  missionaries would have been playing in the game themselves.    On the whole, the reports which reached the mother country were  favourable, and caused great rejoicing among the friends of the mission  staff. But there was one doubt which agitated the minds of a certain  circle of English society, and that was as to the _churchmanship_ of the  New Zealand mission. Its agents were good men, and had achieved  astonishing success; but had they kept up the distinctive tone and  system of the mother Church? Were they distinguishable from the  Methodists by whose side they laboured? No treatment of the subject can  be considered complete which omits this feature of the situation.    Undoubtedly there was some justification for the fears entertained in  the Home land. Marsden himself had been born and brought up in a  Methodist family. From this, as a young man, he had passed without sense  of break or violent change into a church school, and thence to  Cambridge, where he was associated with the Evangelical leaders, who  emphasised the individual rather than the corporate aspect of the  Church's teaching. We have seen that in 1819 he sent over a Methodist  preacher to report upon and to stimulate his nagging workers. He was not  in favour of the Methodists sending a mission of their own to New  Zealand, but when in 1822 his friend Mr. Leigh determined to settle in  the country, Marsden put no obstacles in his way. Not only so, but in  1823 Marsden himself brought over Leigh's colleagues, Hobbs and Turner,  who established their station at Whangaroa, after consultation with the  settlers at the Bay of Islands. The stations were not far apart, and  constant brotherly intercourse was maintained between the occupants.  When the Wesleyans fled from their homes in the turmoil of 1827, it was  to Kerikeri and Paihia that they betook themselves in the first place,  and it was Marsden's parsonage at Parramatta that sheltered them  afterwards. It was by Marsden's advice that they settled at Hokianga on  their return, and they always looked forward to his visits as eagerly as  did their brethren at the Bay of Islands. He himself rejoiced to  receive them to the Holy Communion; their converts were admitted to the  same holy ordinance at Waimate and Paihia; the missionaries preached  without hesitation in one another's pulpits. So anxious were the leaders  on both sides to spare the Maoris the spectacle of Christian disunion,  and to emphasise the fact that they baptised not in their own name but  in that of their common Master, that on the occasion of the reception  into the fold of the great chief Waka Nene and his brother, Patuone,  they arranged that Patuone, who belonged to the Methodists, should be  baptised by the church clergy, while Waka, who was an adherent of the  church mission, should receive the sacred ordinance at the hands of the  Wesleyans.    Highly irregular! some will exclaim. But there are important  considerations which must be kept in mind. In the first place, the  unhappy separation between the Methodist body and the historic Church  had not then assumed the hard and fast character which it bears to-day.  The followers of Wesley were still in fairly close touch with Wesley's  mother Church; they still occupied, to a large extent, the position of a  voluntary order within the established framework. They used the Book of  Common Prayer at their services, and taught the Church Catechism to  their children. And in New Zealand they looked up to Marsden as their  apostle, and were guided in their operations by his disinterested  advice. Nor should it be forgotten that the agents of the C.M.S. were  mostly laymen. Setting aside Hadfield, Mason, and Burrows, who all  appeared upon the scene near the close of our period, there were but  four ordained clergy during the years of co-operation between the two  societies, viz., Brown and Maunsell and the brothers Williams. Nor did  the \"historic episcopate\" present any obstacle to intercommunion. No  bishop was seen in the land until the end of 1838, and then his stay was  but short. There was accordingly no "]]]
