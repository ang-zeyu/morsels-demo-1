In the early days of the railway it was customary to allow a time  interval between the passings of trains, a train not being permitted to  leave a station until at least five minutes after the start of a  preceding train. This method did not, of course, prevent collisions, as  the first train sometimes broke down soon after leaving the station; and  in the absence of effective brakes, its successor ran into it. The  advent of the electric telegraph, which put stations in rapid  communication with one another, proved of the utmost value to the safe  working of railways.      THE BLOCK SYSTEM.    Time limits were abolished and distance limits substituted. A line was  divided into _blocks_, or lengths, and two trains going in the same  direction were never allowed on any one block at the same time.    The signal-posts carrying the movable arms, or semaphores, by means of  which the signalman communicates with the engine-driver, are well known  to us. They are usually placed on the left-hand side of the line of  rails to which they apply, with their arms pointing away from the rails.  The side of the arms which faces the direction from which a train  approaches has a white stripe painted on a red background, the other  side has a black stripe on a white background.    The distant and other signal arms vary slightly in shape (Fig. 91). A  distant signal has a forked end and a V-shaped stripe; the home and  starting signals are square-ended, with straight stripes. When the arm  stands horizontally, the signal is \"on,\" or at \"danger\"; when dropped,  it is \"off,\" and indicates \"All right; proceed.\" At the end nearest the  post it carries a spectacle frame glazed with panes of red and green  glass. When the arm is at danger, the red pane is opposite a lamp  attached to the signal post; when the arm drops, the green pane rises to  that position--so that a driver is kept as fully informed at night as  during the day, provided the lamp remains alight.    [Illustration: FIG. 91.--Distant and home signals.]      POSITION OF SIGNALS.    On double lines each set of rails has its own separate signals, and  drivers travelling on the \"up\" line take no notice of signals meant for  the \"down\" line. Each signal-box usually controls three signals on each  set of rails--the distant, the home, and the starting. Their respective  positions will be gathered from Fig. 92, which shows a station on a  double line. Between the distant and the home an interval is allowed of  800 yards on the level, 1,000 yards on a falling gradient, and 600 yards  on a rising gradient. The home stands near the approach end of the  station, and the starting at the departure end of the platform. The last  is sometimes reinforced by an \"advance starting\" signal some distance  farther on.    It should be noted that the distant is only a _caution_ signal, whereas  both home and starting are _stop_ signals. This means that when the  driver sees the distant \"on,\" he does not stop his train, but slackens  speed, and prepares to stop at the home signal. He must, however, on no  account pass either home or starting if they are at danger. In short,  the distant merely warns the driver of what he may expect at the home.  To prevent damage if a driver should overrun the home, it has been laid  down that no train shall be allowed to pass the starting signal of one  box unless the line is clear to a point at least a quarter of a mile  beyond the home of the next box. That point is called the _standard  clearing point_.    Technically described, a _block_ is a length of line between the last  stop signal worked from one signal-box and the first stop signal worked  from the next signal-box in advance.    [Illustration: FIG. 92.--Showing position of signals. Those at the top  are \"off.\"]      INTERLOCKING SIGNALS.    A signalman cannot lower or restore his signals to their normal  positions in any order he likes. He is compelled to lower them as  follows:--Starting and home; _then_ distant. And restore them--distant;  _then_ starting and home. If a signalman were quite independent, he  might, after the passage of a train, restore the home or starting, but  forget all about the distant, so that the next train, which he wants to  stop, would dash past the distant without warning and have to pull up  suddenly when the home came in sight. But by a mechanical arrangement he  is prevented from restoring the home or starting until the distant is  at danger; and, _vice versa_, he cannot lower the last until the other  two are off. This mechanism is called _locking gear_.      LOOKING GEAR.    There are many different types of locking gear in use. It is impossible  to describe them all, or even to give particulars of an elaborate  locking-frame of any one type. But if we confine ourselves to the  simplest combination of a stud-locking apparatus, such as is used in  small boxes on the Great Western Railway, the reader will get an insight  into the general principles of these safety devices, as the same  principles underlie them all.    [Illustration: FIG. 93.--A signal lever and its connections. To move the  lever, C is pressed towards B raising the catch-rod from its nick in the  rack, G G G, guides; R R, anti-friction rollers; S, sockets for  catch-rod to work in.]    The levers in the particular type of locking gear which we are  considering have each a tailpiece or \"tappet arm\" attached to it, which  moves backwards and forwards with the lever (Fig. 93). Running at right  angles to this tappet, and close to it, either under or above, are the  lock bars, or stud bars. Refer now to Fig. 94, which shows the ends of  the three tappet arms, D, H, and S, crossed by a bar, B, from which  project these studs. The levers are all forward and the signals all  \"on.\" If the signalman tried to pull the lever attached to D down the  page, as it were, he would fail to move it on account of the stud _a_,  which engages with a notch in D. Before this stud can be got free of the  notch the tappets H and S must be pulled over, so as to bring their  notches in line with studs _b_ and _c_ (Fig. 95). The signalman can now  move D, since the notch easily pushes the stud _a_ to the left (Fig.  96). The signals must be restored to danger. As H and S are back-locked  by D--that is, prevented by D from being put back into their normal  positions--D must be moved first. The interlocking of the three signals  described is merely repeated in the interlocking of a large number of  signals.    [Illustration: FIG. 94.]    [Illustration: FIG. 95.]    On entering a signal-box a visitor will notice that the levers have  different colours:--_Green_, signifying distant signals; _red_,  signifying home and starting signals; _blue_, signifying facing points;  _black_, signifying trailing points; _white_, signifying spare levers.  These different colours help the signalman to pick out the right levers  easily.    To the front of each lever is attached a small brass tablet bearing  certain numbers; one in large figures on the top, then a line, and other  numbers in small figures beneath. The large number is that of the lever  itself; the others, called _leads_, refer to levers which must be pulled  before that particular lever can be released.    [Illustration: FIG. 96.]    [Illustration: FIG. 97.--Model signal equipment in a signalling school.  (By permission of the \"G.W.R. Magazine\").]      POINTS.    Mention was made, in connection with the lever, of _points_. Before  going further we will glance at the action of these devices for enabling  a train to run from one set of rails to another. Figs. 98 and 99 show  the points at a simple junction. It will be noticed that the rails of  the line to the left of the points are continued as the outer rails of  the main and branch lines. The inner rails come to a sharp V-point, and  to the left of this are the two short rails which, by means of shifting  portions, decide the direction of a train's travel. In Fig. 98 the main  line is open; in Fig. 99, the branch. The shifting parts are kept  properly spaced by cross bars (or tie-rods), A A.    [Illustration: FIG. 98.--Points open to main line.]    [Illustration: FIG. 99.--Points open to branch line.]    It might be thought that the wheels would bump badly when they reach  the point B, where there is a gap. This is prevented, however, by the  bent ends E E (Fig. 98), on which the tread of the wheel rests until it  has reached some distance along the point of V. The safety rails S R  keep the outer wheel up against its rail until the V has been passed.      POINTS AND SIGNALS IN COMBINATION.    Let us suppose that a train is approaching the junction shown in Figs.  98 and 99 from the left. It is not enough that the driver should know  that the tracks are clear. He must also be assured that the track, main  or branch, as the case may be, along which he has to go, is open; and on  the other hand, if he were approaching from the right, he would want to  be certain that no train on the other line was converging on his. Danger  is avoided and assurance given by interlocking the points and signals.  To the left of the junction the home and distant signals are doubled,  there being two semaphore arms on each post. These are interlocked with  the points in such a manner that the signals referring to either line  can be pulled off only when the points are set to open the way to that  line. Moreover, before any shifting of points can be made, the signals  behind must be put to danger. The convergence of trains is prevented by  interlocking, which renders it impossible to have both sets of distant  and home signals at \"All right\" simultaneously.      WORKING OF BLOCK SYSTEM.
