A considerable amount of Chinese opium  is imported for the use of the Chinese, and a larger amount is probably  smuggled over the Canadian and Mexican borders. Laudanum is an alcoholic  tincture, and morphine an extractive of opium; both are used as  medicine.      QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION    Consult a good physiology and learn the effects of coffee, tea, tobacco,  and opium.    Where and what are the following: Mocha, Java, Maracaibo, Yokohama,  Amoy, Canton, Oaxaca, Hodeida, Rio Janeiro, Santos, Havana; how is each  connected commercially with this chapter?    From the map, Fig. 1, trace the route of a cargo of tea overland from  China to Great Britain.    Consult an English history or a cyclopaedia and learn about the opium  war.      FOR STUDY AND REFERENCE    Obtain samples of the following, preserving them for study and  inspection in closely stoppered vials: Mocha, Java, Rio, and Sumatra  coffees; green, black, and gunpowder tea. Soak a tea-leaf a few minutes  in warm water; unroll the leaf and attach it to a white card, for study.    Obtain samples of gum opium, laudanum, and morphine; note the odor of  the first two and the taste of the last. Remember that they are  poisonous.    Unroll a cheap cigarette and note the character of the tobacco in it,  using a magnifying glass.          CHAPTER XI    GUMS AND RESINS USED IN THE ARTS      Most vegetable juices exposed to the air harden into firm substances,  commonly called _gum_. Some of these dissolve, or at least soften, in  water; these technically are known as \"gums,\" and usually are so  designated in commerce. Others are insoluble in water, but dissolve  readily in alcohol, in naphtha, in turpentine, or in other essential  oils; these are designated as \"gum-resins.\" Still others yield oils or  pitchy substances on distillation; these are known as \"oleo-resins.\"  There are many other dried vegetable juices, however, that in commerce  are not classified among the gums and resins, and of these the most  important is the substance commonly known as india-rubber.    =Rubber and Rubber Products.=--\"Caoutchouc\" is approximately the name  given by Indians of the Amazon forests to a substance that had also been  found in India. Some of it was brought to Europe from the Amazon region  as early as 1736, and for nearly one hundred years no general purpose  was discovered for which it could be used, except to erase lead-pencil  marks--hence the name india-rubber, which has held ever since.    Common rubber is the prepared juice of a dozen or more shrubs and trees,  all of which grow in tropical regions.[37] The belt of rubber-producing  plants extends around the world and includes such well-known species as  the fig, the manihot (or manioc), and the oleander; indeed, it is a  condition of sap rather than a definite species of plant that produces  rubber, and the latter is a manufactured rather than a natural product.  The process of preparing the juice is practically the same in every part  of the world.    The rubber-gatherer of the Amazon, who is practically a slave, wades  into the swamp, makes several incisions in the bark of the tree,  fashions a rough trough of clay under it, and waits till the sap fills  the clay vessel. When the sap has been gathered he makes a fire of the  nuts of the urucuri palm and places an inverted funnel over it to  concentrate the smoke. He first dips the end of a wooden spindle into  the juice and then holds it in the smoke until the juice coagulates;  this process is repeated until there has formed a ball of rubber  weighing from five to ten pounds. The smoke of the palm-nuts is a  chemical agent that converts the juice into the crude rubber of  commerce.    Crude gum, however, is lacking both in strength and elasticity. The  process that makes it a finished product is known as _vulcanization_.  The crude rubber, having been exported to the manufacturer in the United  States or Europe, is shredded, washed, and cleansed, and partly fused  with varying proportions of sulphur. For a very soft product, such as  the inner surface of tires, only a small proportion is used; where the  wear is considerable, a larger proportion is employed.[38] White clay is  sometimes added to give body to the product; coloring matter is also  sometimes added.    By far the greater part of the crude rubber comes from the Amazon  forests. Brazil produces about one-half, but a considerable quantity is  obtained in Acre, the territory formed where the borders of Brazil,  Bolivia, and Peru meet, and now ceded to Brazil. Nearly all this  product, that of the Ceara region excepted, is marketed at Para and is  known as Para rubber. It is the best produced. The African product,  mainly from the forests of the Kongo, and Madagascar, and nearly all the  East Indian product is sent to Europe.    [Illustration: REGIONS YIELDING RUBBER]    The world's product is about one hundred and thirty-three million pounds  of crude rubber. Of this product the United States takes nearly  one-half. The greater part is used in the manufacture of pneumatic  tires, hose, and overshoes. A large part is used for making water-proof  cloth,[39] and considerable is made into the small elastic bands for  which there is a growing use.    =Gutta-Percha.=--Gutta-percha is obtained from the juices of several  plants (chiefly _Dichopsis gutta_ and _Supota muelleri_) both of which  abound in the Malay peninsula and the East Indies. It is prepared in a  manner somewhat similar to that employed in making crude rubber; it is  also easily vulcanized by heating with sulphur. It is used to a limited  extent in the manufacture of golf-balls, but mainly as the insulating  cover of copper wires used in ocean telegraph cables. For this purpose  it has no known substitute, and its essential merit is the fact that it  is not altered by salt water. Nearly all the product is shipped from  Singapore to England.    =Pine-Tree Products.=--The various members of the pine and cone-bearing  trees yield valuable essential oils and oleo-resins that are very  important in the arts and sciences. These, in nearly every instance, are  prepared from the sap of the tree.    _Oil of turpentine_ is known as an \"essential oil,\" and in chemical  structure and properties it does not differ from the various essential  oils, such as lemon, orange, peppermint, etc. Commercial turpentine is  generally made from the sap of the long-leafed pine of the Atlantic  coast-plain.    The bark of the tree is cut near the foot, and the sap that oozes from  the scar quickly hardens into a gum. The gum, generally known as \"crude  turpentine,\" is distilled and yields about one-fourth its weight of oil  or \"spirit\" of turpentine. It is a staple article of manufacture in  Europe, India, and the United States, and is used chiefly to dilute the  oil paints and varnishes used in indoor work. The United States supplies  about two-thirds of the world's product, a large part of which is  shipped from Savannah and Brunswick, Ga., to Great Britain.[40]    _Resin_ is the substance remaining after the crude turpentine has been  distilled. It is used in the manufacture of varnish, sealing-wax, and  soap. Finely powdered resin is also mixed with wood-pulp in the  manufacture of wrapping-paper. It gives the latter a glazed surface and  renders it almost water-proof. Most of the world's product of resin  comes from the turpentine district of the United States, and about  four-fifths of it is exported to Europe.    When resin is subjected to distillation at a still higher temperature,  _resin oil_, a very heavy turpentine, is given off, and a viscous  substance known as _pitch_ remains. A considerable amount of this is  still made in the United States, but the greater part comes from the  pine-forests of Russia and Scandinavia. When pine-wood is distilled,  _tar_ is the chief product. In Russia tar is generally made by burning  green logs covered with turf, over a pit. _Creosote_, or wood  preservative, is made from tar. The various pine-tree products, creosote  excepted, are commonly known as \"naval stores,\" the tar being used in  water-proofing the rigging of vessels, the pitch in calking the seams in  between planks, in the decks and hulls.    =Other Resins and Gums Used in the Arts.=--Most of the gums and resins  used in the arts and sciences are the hardened sap of plants--in some  cases exuding by natural means from the bark, in others resulting from  the puncture of the bark.    The _lac_ of commerce is due to the puncture of the young branches of a  tree, frequently a fig (_Ficus religiosa_) growing in the tropical  forests of India. The hardened sap incrusts twigs forming _stick-lac_;  when crushed, washed, and freed from the woody matter it is _seed-lac_;  when melted and cooled in flakes it is _shell-lac_, the form best known  in commerce. It is the chief ingredient in sealing-wax, and is  extensively used as a varnish. It is also used in fireworks on account  of its inflammability.    _Dammar_ is the product of a tree growing in the East Indies; it is the  basis of a very fine white varnish. _Copal_ is a term applied to  oleo-resins soluble in turpentine, and used almost universally as  varnishes. They come from the tropical regions of South America, Africa,  and from the East Indies. _Kauri_ is the fossil gum of a cone-bearing  tree dug from the ground in northern New Zealand. _Amber_ is the fossil  gum of extinct cone-bearing trees found mainly along the Baltic coast of  Prussia. It is used chiefly for the mouth-pieces of tobacco-pipes and  cigar-holders; the inferior product is made into varnish. It is sold  wherever tobacco is used. _Sandarach_, found on the north African coast,  is used principally in Europe, being employed as a varnish. The United  States and Great Britain consume most of the foregoing products.      QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION    Name"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24902"],[0,"The International Monthly, Volume 2, No. 4, March, 1851 (#20)"],[1,"time her person is not very  flatteringly described.    \"As I was not presented at Court, I never saw the Queen but at the  play-house. She was then in affliction, and her countenance was, no  doubt, disfigured by long suffering and resentment. I should not,  however, suppose that the habitual expression of it, even in happier  seasons, had ever been very agreeable. Her beauty, however extolled,  consisted, I suspect, exclusively in a fair skin, a straight person, and  a stately air, which her admirers termed dignity, and her enemies pride  and disdain. Her total want of judgment and temper no doubt contributed  to the disasters of the Royal Family, but there was no member of it to  whom the public was uniformly so harsh and unjust, and her trial and  death were among the most revolting parts of the whole catastrophe. She  was indeed insensible when led to the scaffold; but the previous  persecution which she underwent was base, unmanly, cruel, and ungenerous  to the last degree.\"    On the other hand, a better case is made out for Egalite than any writer  has yet been bold enough, or informed enough, to attempt. His false  position with the Court is shown not to have been of his own seeking,  and to have ultimately driven him reluctantly into the ranks of the  extreme party. His courage is vindicated successfully, his sincerity and  truthfulness less so. Lord Holland retained his regard for the Orleans  family to the close of his life. He was one of the warmest defenders of  the late King of the French. There are some capital notices of  TALLYRAND.    \"It was in this visit to Paris in 1791, that I first formed acquaintance  with M. Talleyrand. I have seen him in most of his vicissitudes of  fortune; from his conversation I have derived much of the little  knowledge I possess of the leading characters in France before and  during the Revolution. He was then still a bishop. He had, I believe,  been originally forced into holy orders, in consequence of his lameness,  by his family, who, on that account, treated him with an indifference  and unkindness shameful and shocking. He was for some time _aumonier_ to  his uncle, the Archbishop of Rheims; and when Mr. Pitt went to that town  to learn French, after the peace of 1782, he lodged him in an apartment  in the abbey of St. Thierry, where he was then residing with his uncle,  and constantly accompanied him for six weeks, a circumstance to which,  as I have heard M. Talleyrand remark with some asperity, Mr. Pitt never  had the grace to allude either during his embassy, or his emigration, or  in 1794, when he refused to recall the cruel order by which he was sent  away from England under the alien bill. Talleyrand was initiated into  public affairs under M. de Calonne, and learnt from that lively minister  the happy facility of transacting business without effort and without  ceremony in the corner of a drawing-room, or in the recess of a window.\"    Again--of Talleyrand's bon-mots. The bit at Chateaubriand is one of the  happiest we can remember.    \"'Il faut avoir aime Mme. de Stael pour connaitre tout le bonheur  d'aimer une bete,' was a saying of his much quoted at Paris at that  time, in explanation of his passion for Mme. Grand, who certainly did  not win him or any one else by the fascination of her wit or  conversation. For thirty or forty years, the bon-mots of M. de  Talleyrand were more frequently repeated and more generally admired  than those of any living man. The reason was obvious. Few men uttered so  many, and yet fewer any equally good. By a happy combination of neatness  in language and ease and suavity of manner, with archness and sagacity  of thought, his sarcasms assumed a garb at once so courtly and so  careless, that they often diverted almost as much as they could mortify  even their immediate objects. His humorous reproof to a gentleman  vaunting with self-complacency the extreme beauty of his mother, and  apparently implying that it might account for advantages in person in  her descendants, is well known: 'Cetait donc,' said he, 'Monsieur votre  pere qui n'etait pas si bien.' The following is more recent, but the  humor of it hardly less arch or less refined. The celebrity of M. de  Chateaubriand, the vainest of mortals, was on the wane. About the same  time, it happened to be casually mentioned in conversation that  Chateaubriand was affected with deafness, and complained bitterly of  that infirmity. 'Je compends,' said Talleyrand; 'dequis qu'on a cesse de  parler de lui, il se croit sourd.'\"    We find a long portrait gallery of ministers, and princes, and  princesses, one more imbecile, ignorant, and corrupt than another. One  minister did not know the difference between Russia and Prussia; another  always wrote Asiatic for Henseatic, and thought his correction  necessary. Much light is thrown on the first quarrel between Ferdinand  and his father; and the narrow escape of the Duke of Infantado is well  told. Godoy, like all who had the honor of Lord Holland's acquaintance,  was in some degree a favorite of his, his good qualities being brought  out to neutralize his many bad ones. Jovellanos and Arguelles appear the  only honest characters in the midst of such a mass of vice, and even  they were pedantic, impracticable, and prejudiced. No history,  narrative, or memoir can be so disgusting as those of Spain and its  court under the dominion of the House of Bourbon. The imagination of no  novelist has ever attained that _acme_ of duplicity, cruelty, villany,  and cowardice, which made up the character of Ferdinand. The general  opinion of PRINCE METTERNICH, since he has become familiar to London  circles, has been rather to diminish former opinion of his superior  wisdom. Lord Holland's early opinion of the prince is thus recorded:    \"He seems hardly qualified by any superior genius to assume the  ascendency in the councils of his own and neighboring nations, which  common rumor has for some years attributed to him. He appeared to me, in  the short intercourse I had with him, little superior to the common run  of continental politicians and courtiers, and clearly inferior to the  Emperor of Russia in those qualities which secure an influence in great  affairs. Some who admit the degrading but too prevalent opinion that a  disregard to truth is useful and necessary in the government of mankind,  have on that score maintained the contrary proposition. His manners are  reckoned insinuating. In my slight acquaintance with him in London I was  not struck with them; they seemed such as might have been expected from  a German who had studied French vivacity in the fashionable novels of  the day. I saw little of a sagacious and observant statesman, or of a  courtier accustomed to very refined and enlightened society.\"    But the statesman who sustained Austria and procured for it the alliance  of France was not Metternich. Napoleon is known to have long wavered as  to whether he would build his European system on a close alliance with  Prussia or with Austria. Bignon we believe it is that gives the reasons  in the imperial mind for and against. Prussia was the preferable ally,  being a new country, untrammelled by aristocratic ideas, ambitious,  military, and eager for domination. But Napoleon had humiliated Prussia  too deeply to be forgiven. And then Napoleon had in those around him  politicians who revered Austria for its antiquity and prestige, and who,  like Lord Aberdeen, made the Caesar of Vienna the pivot on which their  ideas of policy turned. Talleyrand was one of them. He worshipped  Austria, opposed all his master's plans for crushing her, and even dared  to thwart those plans by revealing them to Alexander, and prompting him  secretly to oppose them. Such treachery fully warrants all the suspicion  and harshness with which Napoleon treated Talleyrand. The latter's  conduct is fully revealed in this volume by Lord Holland. In fact, the  way in which Napoleon found his policy most seriously counteracted, and  his projects foiled, was his weakness in employing the men of the  _ancien regime_, the nobles, whom he preferred for their pleasing and  good manners, but who invariably betrayed the _parvenu_ master, who  employed and courted them. By an instance of this grievously misplaced  confidence Napoleon lost his throne. In the last events and negotiations  of 1814 Napoleon employed Caulaincourt, who, had he had full power,  might have made an arrangement. Talleyrand and his party at the same  time employed M. de Vitrolles, and sent him to the Emperor of Austria to  learn on what terms he would be induced either to support Napoleon or  abandon him. The Emperor of Austria was naturally most unwilling to  proceed to the latter extreme. But M. Vitrolles, a secret agent of the  Bourbons, so falsified and misrepresented everything to the Emperor that  the sacrifice of Napoleon was assented to.    Our last extract relates some traits of the great NAPOLEON which seem  more than ordinarily worth his nephew's attention just now. They are  taken from a somewhat elaborate character of the Emperor which occupies  nearly a third of the volume.    \"Nothing could exceed the order and regularity with which his household  both as Consul and Emperor was conducted. The great things he  accomplished, and the savings he made, without even the imputation of  avarice or meanness, with the sum comparatively inconsiderable of  fifteen millions of francs a year, are marvellous, and expose his  successors, and indeed all European Princes, to the reproach of  negligence or incapacity. In this branch of his government he owed much  to Duroc. It is said that they often visited the markets of Paris (les  halles) dressed in plain clothes and early in the morning. When any  great accounts were to be submitted to the Emperor, Duroc would apprize  him in secret of some of the minutest details. By an adroit allusion to  them or a careless remark on the"]]]
