[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24654"],[0,"Chaldea: From the Earliest Times to the Rise of Assyria (#20)"],[1," extremely numerous race, which early spread over the greater part of  the earth and at one time probably equalled in numbers the rest of  mankind. It seems always to have been broken up into a great many tribes  and peoples, whom it has been found convenient to gather under the  general designation of TURANIANS, from a very ancient name,--TUR or  TURA--which was given them by the white population of Persia and Central  Asia, and which is still preserved in that of one of their principal  surviving branches, the TURKS. All the different members of this great  family have had very striking features in common,--the most  extraordinary being an incapability of reaching the highest culture, of  progressing indefinitely, improving continually. A strange law of their  being seems to have condemned them to stop short, when they had attained  a certain, not very advanced, stage. Thus their speech has remained  extremely imperfect. They spoke, and such Turanian nations as now exist  still speak, languages, which, however they may differ, all have this  peculiarity, that they are composed either entirely of monosyllables,  (the most rudimentary form of speech), or of monosyllables pieced into  words in the stiffest, most unwieldy manner, stuck together, as it  were, with nothing to join them, wherefore this kind of language has  been called _agglutinative_. Chinese belongs to the former class of  languages, the \"monosyllabic,\" Turkish to the latter, the  \"agglutinative.\" Further, the Turanians were probably the first to  invent writing, but never went in that art beyond having one particular  sign for every single word--(such is Chinese writing with its forty  thousand signs or thereabouts, as many as words in the language)--or at  most a sign for every syllable. They had beautiful beginnings of poetry,  but in that also never went beyond beginnings. They were also probably  the first who built cities, but were wanting in the qualities necessary  to organize a society, establish a state on solid and lasting  foundations. At one time they covered the whole of Western Asia, dwelt  there for ages before any other race occupied it,--fifteen hundred  years, according to a very trustworthy tradition,--and were called by  the ancients \"the oldest of men;\" but they vanish and are not heard of  any more the moment that white invaders come into the land; these drive  the Turanians before them, or bring them into complete subjection, or  mix with them, but, by force of their own superiorly gifted nature,  retain the dominant position, so that the others lose all separate  existence. Thus it was everywhere. For wherever tribes of the three  Biblical races came, they mostly found Turanian populations who had  preceded them. There are now a great number of Turanian tribes, more or  less numerous--Kirghizes, Bashkirs, Ostiaks, Tunguzes, etc.,  etc.--scattered over the vast expanse of Siberia and Eastern Russia,  where they roam at will with their flocks and herds of horses,  occasionally settling down,--fragmentary remnants of a race which, to  this latest time, has preserved its original peculiarities and  imperfections, whose day is done, which has long ceased to improve,  unless it assimilates with the higher white race and adopts their  culture, when all that it lacked is supplied by the nobler element which  mixes with it, as in the case of the Hungarians, one of the most  high-spirited and talented nations of Europe, originally of Turanian  stock. The same may be said, in a lesser degree, of the Finns--the  native inhabitants of the Russian principality of Finland.    12. All this by no means goes to show that the Yellow Race has ever been  devoid of fine faculties and original genius. Quite the contrary; for,  if white races everywhere stepped in, took the work of civilization out  of their hands and carried it on to a perfection of which they were  incapable, still they, the Turanians, had everywhere _begun_ that work,  it was their inventions which the others took up and improved: and we  must remember that it is very much easier to improve than to invent.  Only there is that strange limitation to their power of progress and  that want of natural refinement, which are as a wall that encloses them  around. Even the Chinese, who, at first sight, are a brilliant  exception, are not so on a closer inspection. True, they have founded  and organized a great empire which still endures; they have a vast  literature, they have made most important inventions--printing,  manufacturing paper out of rags, the use of the compass,  gunpowder--centuries before European nations made them in their turn.  Yet the latter do all those things far better; they have improved these,  to them, new inventions more in a couple of hundred years than the  Chinese in a thousand. In fact it is a good many centuries since the  Chinese have ceased to improve anything at all. Their language and  writing are childishly imperfect, though the oldest in existence. In  government, in the forms of social life, in their ideas generally, they  follow rules laid down for them three thousand years ago or more and  from which to swerve a hair's breadth were blasphemy. As they have  always stubbornly resisted foreign influences, and gone the length of  trying actually to erect material walls between themselves and the rest  of the world, their empire is a perfectly fair specimen of what the  Yellow Race can do, if left entirely to itself, and quite as much of  what it can_not_ do, and now they have for centuries presented that  unique phenomenon--a great nation at a standstill.    13. All this obviously leads us to a very interesting and suggestive  question: what is this great race which we find everywhere at the very  roots of history, so that not only ancient tradition calls them \"the  oldest of men,\" but modern science more and more inclines to the same  opinion? Whence came it? How is it not included in the great family of  nations, of which Chap. X. of Genesis gives so clear and comprehensive a  scheme? Parallel to this question arises another: what became of Cain's  posterity? What, above all, of the descendants of those three sons of  Lamech, whom the writer of Genesis clearly places before us as heads of  nations and thinks of sufficient importance to specify what their  occupations were? (See Genesis iv. 19-22.) Why do we never hear any more  of this entire half of humanity, severed in the very beginning from the  other half--the lineage of the accursed son from that of the blest and  favored son? And may not the answer to this series of questions be the  answer to the first series also?    14. With regard to the second series this answer is plain and decisive.  The descendants of Cain were necessarily out of the pale of the Hebrew  world. The curse of God, in consequence of which their forefather is  said to have gone \"out of the presence of the Lord,\" at once and forever  separated them from the posterity of the pious son, from those who  \"walked with God.\" The writer of Genesis tells us that they lived in the  \"Land of Exile\" and multiplied, then dismisses them. For what could the  elect, the people of God, or even those other nations who went astray,  who were repeatedly chastised, but whose family bond with the righteous  race was never entirely severed--what could they have in common with the  banished, the castaway, the irretrievably accursed? These did not count,  they were not of humanity. What more probable, therefore, than that,  being excluded from all the other narratives, they should not be  included in that of the Flood? And in that case, who should they be but  that most ancient race, set apart by its color and several striking  peculiarities, which everywhere preceded their white brethren, but were  invariably supplanted by them and not destined to supremacy on the  earth? This supposition has been hazarded by men of great genius, and if  bold, still has much to support it; if confirmed it would solve many  puzzles, throw strong and unexpected light on many obscure points. The  very antiquity of the Yellow Race tallies admirably with the Biblical  narrative, for of the two Biblical brothers Cain was the eldest. And the  doom laid on the race, \"a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be on the  earth,\" has not been revoked through all ages. Wherever pure Turanians  are--they are nomads. And when, fifteen hundred years ago and later,  countless swarms of barbarous people flooded Europe, coming from the  east, and swept all before them, the Turanian hordes could be known  chiefly by this, that they destroyed, burned, laid waste--and passed,  vanished: whereas the others, after treating a country quite as  savagely, usually settled in it and founded states, most of which exist  even now--for, French, German, English, Russian, we are all descended  from some of those barbarous invaders. And this also would fully explain  how it came to pass that, although the Hebrews and their  forefathers--let us say the Semites generally--everywhere found  Turanians on their way, nay, dwelt in the same lands with them, the  sacred historian ignores them completely, as in Gen. xi. 2.    15. For they were Turanians, arrived at a, for them, really high state  of culture, who peopled the land of Shinar, when \"_they_\"--descendants  of Noah,--journeying in the East, found that plain where they dwelt for  many years.    FOOTNOTES:    [AA] \"_Gentes non homines._\" (_De Civitate Dei_, XVII., 3.)    [AB] If, as has been suggested, the \"land of Sinim\" in Isaiah xlix., 12,  is meant for China, such a solitary, incidental and unspecified mention  of a country the name of which may have been vaguely used to express the  remotest East, cannot invalidate the scheme so evidently and  persistently pursued in the composition of Chap. X.                                         III.      TURANIAN CHALDEA.--SHUMIR AND ACCAD.--THE BEGINNINGS OF RELIGION.      1. It is not Berosus alone who "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24700"],[0,"A History of French Literature (#20)"],[1,"he rose through every rank to be the  King's lieutenant of Guyenne and a Marshal of France; during fifty  years he fought, as a daring captain rather than as a great general,  amorous of danger, and at length, terribly disfigured by wounds, he  sat down, not to rest, but to wield his pen as if it were a sword  of steel. His _Commentaires_ were meant to be a manual for hardy  combatants, and what model could he set before the young aspirant  so animating as himself? In his earlier wars against the foreign foes  of his country, Monluc was indeed a model of military prowess; the  civil wars added cruelty to his courage; after a fashion he was  religious, and a short shrift and a cord were good enough for heretics  and adversaries of his King. An unlettered soldier, Monluc, by virtue  of his energy of character and directness of speech, became a most  impressive and spirited narrator. His Memoirs close with a sigh for  stern and inviolable solitude. Among the Pyrenean rocks he had  formerly observed a lonely monastery, in view at once of Spain and  France; there it was his wish to end his days.    From the opposite party in the great religious and political strife  came the temperate Memoirs of Lanoue, the simple and beautiful record  of her husband's life by Madame de Mornay, and that of his own career,  written in an old age of gloom and passion, by D'Aubigne. The ideas  of Henri IV.--himself a royal author in his _Lettres missives_--are  embodied in the _OEconomies Royales_ of the statesman Sully, whose  secretaries were employed for the occasion in laboriously reciting  his words and deeds as they had learnt them from their chief. The  superficial aspects of the life of society, the manners and morals--or  lack of morals--of the time, are lightly and brightly exhibited by  PIERRE DE BOURDEILLE, lord of BRANTOME, Catholic abbe, soldier and  courtier, observer of the great world, gossip of amorous secrets.  His _Vies des Hommes Illustres et des Grands Capitaines_, his _Vies  des Dames Illustres et des Dames Galantes_, and his _Memoires_  contained matter too dangerous, perhaps, for publication during his  lifetime, but the author cherished the thought of his posthumous  renown. Brantome, wholly indifferent to good and evil, had a vivid  interest in life; virtue and vice concerned him alike and equally,  if only they had vivacity, movement, colour; and although, as with  Monluc, it was a physical calamity that made him turn to authorship,  he wrote with a naive art, an easy grace, and abundant spirit. To  correct and complete Brantome's narrative as it related to herself,  Marguerite, Queen of Navarre, first wife of Henri IV., prepared her  unfinished Memoirs, which opens the delightful series of  autobiographies and reminiscences of women. Her account of the night  of St. Bartholomew is justly celebrated; the whole record, indeed,  is full of interest; but there were passages of her life which it  was natural that she should pass over in silence; her sins of omission,  as Bayle has observed, are many.[4]    [Footnote 4: The _Memoires-Journeaux_ of Pierre de l'Estoile are a  great magazine of the gains of the writer's disinterested curiosity.  The _Lettres_ of D'Ossat and the _Negotiations_ of the President  Jeannin are of importance in the records of diplomacy.]    The controversies of the civil wars produced a militant literature,  in which the extreme parties contended with passion, while between  these a middle party, the aspirants to conciliation, pleaded for the  ways of prudence, and, if possible, of peace. FRANCOIS HOTMAN, the  effect of whose Latin _Franco-Gallia_, a political treatise  presenting the Huguenot demands, has been compared to that of  Rousseau's _Contrat Social_, launched his eloquent invective against  the Cardinal de Lorraine, in the _Epistre envoyee au Tigre de la  France_. Hubert Languet, the devoted friend of Philip Sidney, in his  _Vindiciae contra Tyrannos_, justified rebellion against princes who  violate by their commands the laws of God. D'Aubigne, in his  _Confession de Sancy_, attacked with characteristic ardour the  apostates and waverers of the time, above the rest that threefold  recanter of his faith, Harlay de Sancy. Marnix de Sainte-Aldegonde,  in his _Tableau des Differands de la Religion_, mingles theological  erudition with his raillery against the Roman communion. Henri  Estienne applied the spirit and learning of a great humanist to  religious controversy in the second part of his _Apologie pour  Herodote_; the marvellous tales of the Greek historian may well be  true, he sarcastically maintains, when in this sixteenth century the  abuses of the Roman Church seem to pass all belief. On the other hand,  Du Perron, a cardinal in 1604, replied to the arguments and citations  of the heretics. As the century drew towards its close, violence  declined; the struggle was in a measure appeased. In earlier days  the Chancellor, Michel de l'Hospital, had hoped to establish harmony  between the rival parties; grief for the massacre of St. Bartholomew  hastened his death. The learned Duplessis-Mornay, leader and guide  of the Reformed Churches of France, a devoted servant of Henri of  Navarre, while fervent in his own beliefs, was too deeply attached  to the common faith of Christianity to be an extreme partisan. The  reconciliation of Henri IV. with the Church of Rome, which delivered  France from anarchy, was, however, a grief to some of his most loyal  supporters, and of these Duplessis-Mornay was the most eminent.    The cause of Henri against the League was served by the manuscript  circulation of a prose satire, with interspersed pieces of verse,  the work of a group of writers, moderate Catholics or converted  Protestants, who loved their country and their King, the _Satire  Menipee_.[5] When it appeared in print (1594; dated on the title-page  1593) the cause was won; the satire rose upon a wave of success, like  a gleaming crest of bitter spray. It is a parody of the Estates of  the League which had been ineffectually convoked to make choice of  a king. Two Rabelaisian charlatans, one from Spain, one from Lorraine,  offer their drugs for sale in the court of the Louvre; the virtues  of the Spanish Catholicon, a divine electuary, are manifold--it will  change the blackest criminal into a spotless lamb, it will transform  a vulgar bonnet to a cardinal's hat, and at need can accomplish a  score of other miracles. Presently the buffoon Estates file past to  their assembly; the hall in which they meet is tapestried with  grotesque scenes from history; the order of the sitting is determined,  and the harangues begin, harangues in which each speaker exposes his  own ambitions, greeds, hypocrisies, and egoism, until Monsieur  d'Aubray, the orator of the _tiers etat_, closes the debate with a  speech in turn indignant, ironical, or grave in its commiseration  for the popular wrongs--an utterance of bourgeois honesty and good  sense. The writers--Canon Pierre Leroy; Gillot, clerk-advocate of  the Parliament of Paris; Rapin, a lettered combatant at Ivry; Jean  Passerat, poet and commentator on Rabelais; Chrestien and Pithou,  two Protestants discreetly converted by force of events--met in a  room of Gillot's house, where, according to the legend, Boileau was  afterwards born, and there concocted the venom of their pamphlet.  Its wit, in spite of some extravagances and the tedium of certain  pages, is admirable; farce and comedy, sarcasm and moral prudence  alternate; and it had the great good fortune of a satire, that of  coming at the lucky moment.    [Footnote 5: Varro, who to a certain extent copied from Menippus the  Gadarene, had called his satires _Saturae Menippeae_; hence the  title.]    The French Huguenots were not without their poets. Two of  these--Guillaume Saluste, Seigneur du Bartas, and Agrippa  d'Aubigne--are eminent. The fame of DU BARTAS (1544-90) was indeed  European. Ronsard sent him a pen of gold, and feared at a later time  the rivalry of his renown; Tasso drew inspiration from his verse;  the youthful Milton read him with admiration in the rendering by  Sylvester; long afterwards Goethe honoured him with praise beyond  his deserts. To read his poems now, notwithstanding passages of vivid  description and passages of ardent devotional feeling, would need  rare literary fortitude. His originality lies in the fact that while  he was a disciple of the Pleiade, a disciple crude, intemperate, and  provincial, he deserted Greece and Rome, and drew his subjects from  Hebraic sources. His _Judith_ (1573), composed by the command of  Jeanne d'Albret, has more of Lucan than of Virgil in its over-emphatic  style. _La Sepmaine, ou la Creation en Sept Journees_, appeared in  1578, and within a few years had passed through thirty editions. Du  Bartas is always copious, sometimes brilliant, sometimes majestic;  but laboured and rhetorical description, never ending and still  beginning, fatigues the mind; an encyclopaedia of the works of  creation weighs heavily upon the imagination; we sigh for the arrival  of the day of rest.    THEODORE-AGRIPPA D'AUBIGNE (1550-1630) was not among the admirers  of Du Bartas. His natural temper was framed for pleasure; at another  time he might have been known only as a poet of the court, of lighter  satire, and of love; the passions of the age transformed him into  an ardent and uncompromising combatant. His classical culture was  wide and exact; at ten years old he translated the _Crito_; Latin,  Greek, Hebrew, Italian, Spanish were at his command. He might, had  France been at peace with herself, have appeared in literature as  a somewhat belated Ronsardist; but his hereditary cause became his  own. While still a child he accepted from his father, in presence  of the withering heads of the conspirators of Amboise, the oath of  immitigable vengeance.
