Cliff Swallow it is in the West, but \"Eave\" Swallow it should be in the  East where the rows of flask-shaped mud nests cluster thick beneath  projecting roofs. They prefer unpainted buildings and the modern barn  rarely knows them. The white, brown-spotted eggs are laid in the latter  half of May.      BARN SWALLOW    _Hirundo erythrogaster. Case 5, Fig. 32_              Chestnut underparts and a forked tail are the            chief characters of this beautiful Swallow.

Barn Swallows are far more beautiful, more graceful and more  companionable than Purple Martins. But while we are erecting special  dwellings for the Martins we are making our barns Swallow-proof. A pair  of Barn Swallows are not only cheerful neighbors but good investments.  Let us make it possible for them to enter the hay-mow. We may even  supply shelves as foundations for their open mud nests. The white,  spotted eggs are laid in the latter half of May.      TREE SWALLOW    _Iridoprocne bicolor. Case 5, Fig. 24_              Silky white below and shining bluish green above;            young birds are mouse-colored above but below are            snowy white, unmarked, as in the adult. L. 6.              _Range._ Nests chiefly from southern New England            northward and winters from South Carolina to            Central America.

We see comparatively few Tree Swallows during the spring, but from July  to October, as they journey slowly southward, they are the most abundant  members of their family. In countless thousands long ropes of Swallows  crowd the wayside wires from pole to pole. At night, with others of  their tribe, they roost in the marshes.    Tree Swallows they are called because they nest in hollow trees and,  like some other hole-nesting birds, they may be induced to occupy  nesting-boxes, making a welcome addition to our list of bird tenants.  The 4-7 white eggs are laid in May.      BANK SWALLOW    _Riparia riparia. Case 6. Fig. 54_              Note the small size, dull plumage, and            breast-band. L. 5-1/4.              _Range._ A native of the Old World as well as of            the New. In North America nesting from Louisiana            and Virginia nearly to the Arctic Circle; winters            in the tropics.

The Bank Swallow is a bird of the air who tunnels the earth for a  nesting-place. Where river or road has left a bank, its face may be  dotted with the entrances to the Bank Swallow's dwellings. At the end of  two or three feet the nest of grass and feathers is placed, fit  receptacle for the pearl-white eggs, which are usually laid the latter  half of May.    During the migrations the Bank Swallow travels with other members of its  family, sharing their roost in the marshes by night and their wayside  perch by day.      ROUGH-WINGED SWALLOW    _Stelgidopteryx serripennis. Case 6, Fig. 56_              With the general appearance of the Bank Swallow,            but slightly larger, grayer below, and with no            breast-band. L. 5-3/4.              _Range._ Nests from the Gulf States north to            Massachusetts and Minnesota: winters in the            tropics.              Washington, common S.R., Apl. 2-Sept. 3.

It nests in small colonies of about half a  dozen pairs, sometimes in holes, at others under bridges, crevices in  cliffs and similar situations. In the fall, it flocks with other species  of its family. Its 4-8 white eggs are laid the latter half of May.          WAXWINGS. FAMILY BOMBYCILLIDAE      BOHEMIAN WAXWING    _Bombycilla garrula_              Similar to the Cedar Waxwing, but larger, the            primary coverts and secondaries tipped with white,            the primaries tipped with white or yellow, the            under tail-coverts chestnut. L. 8.              _Range._ Western Canada; in winter east to            Minnesota and rarely as far as Connecticut.              Glen Ellyn, one record, Jan. 22, 1908. SE. Minn.,            irregular W.V., until Apl. 1.    There are comparatively few authentic records of this beautiful bird  east of the Alleghanies. Enthusiastic bird-students are, I fear, apt to  give Waxwings, seen in winter, the benefit of the doubt and call them  'Bohemians.' Look especially for the white marks on the Bohemian's  wings. Its large size might not be apparent unless the two species were  seen together.      CEDAR WAXWING    _Bombycilla cedrorum. Case 2, Fig. 40; Case 4, Fig. 54_              Crest usually conspicuous; tail tipped with            yellow; a black 'bridle.'              _Range._ Nests from North Carolina and Kansas to            Canada; winters irregularly throughout the United            States.              Washington, very common P.R., less so in winter.            Ossining, common P.R. Cambridge, not common P.R.,            common S.R., abundant T.V. in spring, Feb. 1-Apl.            25. N. Ohio, irregularly common in summer. Glen            Ellyn. S.R., Jan. 21-Sept. 24; occasional W.V. SE.            Minn., common S.R., Feb. 25-Sept. 28.    A Waxwing's crest is as expressive as a horse's ears. One moment it  points skyward the next it flattens and disappears. They are as sociable  as \"Love Birds,\" traveling in small flocks which, like one bird, dive  into a tree and perch so close together that often several will be  almost touching, and with common accord they take wing. They feed mainly  on small fruit both wild and cultivated but are also expert flycatchers.  They nest in June, usually in shade or fruit trees, building a well-made  nest for the beautiful, clay-colored, black-spotted eggs.          SHRIKES. FAMILY LANIIDAE      NORTHERN SHRIKE    _Lanius borealis. Case 2, Fig. 56_              Larger than the Migrant and Loggerhead Shrikes            with a grayish, not black, forehead and a lightly            barred, not plain white breast. L. 10-1/4.              _Range._ Nests in Canada, winters south to Texas            and Virginia.              Washington, rare and irregular W.V., Oct.-Feb.            Ossining, tolerably common W.V., Oct. 26-Apl. 17.            Cambridge, common W.V., Nov. 1-Apl. 1. N. Ohio,            not common W.V., Nov. 6-Apl. 3. Glen Ellyn, not            common W.V., Oct. 24-June 5. SE. Minn., common            W.V., Oct. 17-Mch. 28.    A grim, gray bird that comes out of the far North in the fall. His  mission is death to birds and mice and he makes no attempt to disguise  it but boldly advertises his presence by perching where he may be seen  as well as see. Mice he can plunge on, but Sparrows, Siskins or Redpolls  he may have to pursue on the wing, following every twist and turn until  he reaches striking distance. Slowly he bears his victim, in his feet,  to some tree there to hang it on thorn or in crotch from which it may be  devoured at leisure. An executioner by birth, the Shrike or \"Butcher  Bird\" evidently pursues his calling with no regrets and when spring  time approaches adds his voice to the chorus of bird song.      LOGGERHEAD SHRIKE    _Lanius ludovicianus ludovicianus. Case 4, Fig. 55_              A gray bird with black wings and tail marked with            white which shows in flight; smaller than the            Northern Shrike with a black forehead and unmarked            breast. L. 9.              _Range._ Florida north to North Carolina, west to            Louisiana.    The Loggerhead has the general habits of his larger northern cousin the  \"Butcher-bird,\" but he feeds, as a rule, on smaller game. Grasshoppers  and lizards form the larger part of his fare and the barbed wire fences  not infrequently are his shambles. A flight is ended by an upward swing  to the chosen perch which may be a tree-top, a telegraph wire, or  lightning-rod tip. From such a lookout he keeps a sharp watch for his  prey, which he detects at surprisingly long distances; meanwhile  uttering the gurgles, squeaks and pipes which constitute his song. The  nest is built in hedges or low trees in early March. The 3-5 eggs are  dull white thickly marked with brown and lavender.

Nothing could  be more admirable than Wow's submission, more perfect than his  obedience. He never looked towards the kitchen stairs, and would attend  at the family meals without following the retiring dishes with a wistful  gaze, or betraying a longing for the forbidden bones by so much as a  sniff. Attached to the lower department of the household is a humble  cat, a faithful creature in her way, but not cultivated by my friend as  I could wish. With this meek and useful animal Wow contracted a  friendship regarded by his master as a proof of his amiability and  condescension. (In my capacity of narrator I am compelled to use the  latter somewhat injurious term--as a private individual with an undying  recollection, I repudiate it). But the single-minded Q.C. had something  to learn of the four-footed exile from the Far East concerning this  intimacy. Coming into his study one day at an unusual hour, he saw the  cat--I do not know her name, I am afraid she has not one--stealthily  depositing a bone behind a curtain. Presently she went downstairs, and  returned with a second bone, which she conveyed to the same place of  concealment, whence proceeded a gentle rustling and whisking, suggestive  of the presence of Wow, whose house, or pagoda, was empty. Then arose  the Q.C., and cautiously peeped behind the curtain, where he beheld Wow  and his humble friend amicably discussing their respective bones, Wow's  being the bigger and the meatier of the two.    Thus did the Japanese exile illustrate the cosmopolitan story of the  catspaw (with the improvement of making it pleasant for the cat), and  accomplish the proverbially desirable feat of minding both his meat and  his manners. If we could be secured against their imitation, it would be  pleasant to ask our own domestic pets the problems:        \"What do you think of that, my cat?\"      \"What do you think of that, my dog?\"                A CONSTANT READER AND DISCIPLE.      THE BIOGRAPHY OF SPRIG.              [_Jan. 20, 1872._]    I dare not hope to equal the eloquent and most touching biography of  Nero, with whom I had the honour of a slight acquaintance. But I was the  possessor of an animal who, in his way as a dog, not a cat, for  originality of character, reasoning power, talent, and devoted affection  I have never seen equalled in his species, and you and your readers may  possibly be interested by a sketch of his biography.    Where Sprig was born I do not know, nor had I any acquaintance with his  parents. One morning several years ago I chanced to go down stairs  early, and found the milk-boy at the hall door, delivering his daily  supply to the cook. In the courtyard before my house was a  bright-looking rough terrier of small size, frisking about very  cheerfully, trying to catch the small stump of a tail which some cruel  despoiler had left him. As he was engaged in this pastime, a large brown  retriever entered the gate, to look on, I suppose, for he had an amused  expression of face, and was wagging his tail amicably. Sprig, however,  though but a mite in comparison, decidedly resented the intrusion, and  flew at the retriever's throat, from which he had to be choked off by  his owner, who brought him back in his arms. The little fellow was in  the highest state of excitement and anger, his bright, intelligent eyes  flashing, and his hair bristling. He was indeed most amusingly fierce,  but was soon calmed when he was shown, and told, that his enemy had  fled, whereupon the following colloquy ensued between myself and his  owner: Myself: \"And where did you get that dog, boy? You did not steal  him, I hope?\" Boy, in a rich Dublin brogue: \"Ah, now! would I stale  anythin', yer honner, an' me the poor milk-boy? Is it stale him? Bedad,  it's my father's cuzin that's at the Curragh! Sure he's a corporal, so  he is. He brought him, and he sez, 'Yez'll get me a pound for him, and  no less.' So it's a pound I want for him, sur, and nothin' less. An'  sure John Lambert knows me well--so he does!\" When John, my servant,  was sent for, he gave a good account of the lad, and as he entirely  approved of Sprig, I gave the sovereign, showing it to the dog, whose  wondering eyes were glancing from one to the other. Then I said to the  boy, \"Put him into my arms, and tell him he belongs to me;\" and he did  so. The little fellow looked curiously and wistfully at the lad, who, to  do him justice, had tears in his eyes, and then nestled into my breast,  licking my hands and face. When my daughter came down stairs, I took up  Sprig and placed him in my youngest daughter's arms, a process he  appeared to comprehend perfectly, and told him she was his mistress; nor  to the day of his death did he ever falter in his devoted allegiance to  her. He was very fond of me and of us all, but his deepest love was for  his mistress, and on many occasions was most affecting to see. She was  often delicate, and once had a sharp attack of typhus fever. In this  illness Sprig never left her. He would lie at the foot of her bed  watching her, and would sometimes creep gently up to her, put his paws  round her neck, and lick her hands softly, while the pleading of his  large eyes looking from his mistress, in her unconscious delirium, to  her sister and me, was touching in the extreme. Indeed, there were then  many sad illnesses, but Sprig was always the same. As my child grew  stronger and better her little friend would amuse her by the hour  together; sit up, beg, preach, play with his ball, and try in humble  doggie fashion to beguile her of her pain. But I am anticipating.    Sprig was, I believe, what is called a Dandie Dinmont, and as he grew up  he became, for his class, a very handsome, as he was a sturdy, little  fellow, with great strength for his size. He was a reddish-brown colour,  more dark-red than brown, like a squirrel, with white below, and a  delightfully fuzzy head, and a breast of long soft white hair. His eyes  were that peculiar bright liquid \"dog\" brown which is capable of so much  expression, and he grew to have a long moustache and beard. Even the  most un-observant of dogs admired him, for he resembled no terrier I  have ever seen. I think he would have won the prize of his class at the  Dublin Dog Show, had it not been for a terrible accident he met with in  being wounded by a large foxhound in a neighbouring orchard. His neck  was then torn open, and he was rescued by John only in time to prevent  his being killed. As it was, it was weeks before he could walk--and how  patient he was all the time! and as the wound healed it left a  thickening of his skin which had an awkward look. Sprig was, however,  \"highly commended.\" In his youth he was perhaps rather short in his  temper, and always resented in the most distinct manner any liberty that  was taken with him. To tread upon his foot was perilous, but he was at  once pacified if an apology was made that it was accidental; but to pull  his tail wilfully was an insult which he resented bitterly, and for  which much atonement was necessary, or he would go under the sofa and  cry in his peculiar manner when offended.    As he grew up, Sprig developed various talents which were highly  cultivated. His greatest pleasure, perhaps, was in an india-rubber ball,  with which his gambols were indescribably pretty and constant. It was a  great distress when he lost or mislaid his ball, and he was miserable  till he found it, or another was brought him. It was a cruel thing to  say, when one of us went to town, \"Sprig, I will bring you a new ball,\"  and as sometimes happened, to forget to do so. On return he would sniff  about the person who had gone, poke his nose into his or her pockets,  and if disappointed could hardly be soothed, but would go away and have  his quiet cry to himself. Sometimes a kind friend who knew him might  bring him a new ball; but it very much depended on who presented it  whether it was accepted or not, and I am afraid that too frequently for  his good manners he turned it over contemptuously with his nose and left  it for the old one, which, gnawed, bitten, and broken, was still the  favourite. I used sometimes to make a ball squeak by pressing the hole  against my hand, and I believe he thought it was in pain, for he would  whine piteously, and would not let me rest till he had it again in his  possession. It was most amusing to see him when a parcel of new balls  arrived, he having been told beforehand that one was coming. He would  find out directly who had it, and become impatient and cross indeed if  he did not get it directly. When the parcel was given him, his great  delight was to open it himself and select _one_. A red ball was usually  preferred, but not always. All were subjected to the most varied  trials--gnawed, smelt, and rolled, till the one which pleased his fancy  was finally selected; of the rest he would take no notice whatever.    Sprig was thoroughly a gentleman, and on most occasions he was most  attentive to lady visitors. He never noticed gentlemen. On one occasion,  when my daughters were out, a dear friend called (Nero's mistress). She  told us afterwards that Sprig had been a most attentive beau. He met her  at the hall door, welcomed her in his odd fashion, trotted before her  into the drawing-room, looking behind him to see if she followed. He  then jumped upon the ottoman, inviting her to sit down; when she was  seated he brought his ball and went through all his tricks with it, sat  up on his hind legs, begged with his paws, preached to her in his own  queer way, and kept her amused till, no longer able to remain, she bid  him good morning and left, evidently to his disgust. \"Could he have  spoken,\" she said afterwards, \"he would have told me to wait, for his  mistresses would soon be back; the look was in his face, but the words  were wanting.\" His attention to visitors was"]]]
