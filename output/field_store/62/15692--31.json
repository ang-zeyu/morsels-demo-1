It was only the piety of the king, as Dr. Fian admitted in his  confession, that overmatched the power of the evil one.[1]    Such is the story that stirred Scotland from end to end. It is a story  that is easily explained. The confessions were wrung from the supposed  conspirators by the various forms of torture \"lately provided for  witches in that country.\" Geillis Duncane had been tried with \"the  torture of the pilliwinkes upon her fingers, which is a grievous  torture, and binding or wrinching her head with a cord or roape.\" Agnes  Sampson had suffered terrible tortures and shameful indignities until  her womanly modesty could no longer endure it and she confessed  \"whatsoever was demanded of her.\" Dr. Fian was put through the ordinary  forms of torture and was then \"put to the most severe and cruel pain in  the world, called the bootes,\" and thereby was at length induced to  break his silence and to incriminate himself. At another time, when the  king, who examined him in person, saw that the man was stubborn and  denied the confessions already made, he ordered him to be tortured  again. His finger nails were pulled off with a pair of pincers, and  under what was left of them needles were inserted \"up to the heads.\"  This was followed by other tortures too terrible to narrate.[2]    It is a little hard to understand how it was that the king \"took great  delight to be present at the examinations,\" but throughout the whole  wretched series of trials he was never wanting in zeal. When Barbara  Napier, sister-in-law to the laird of Carshoggil, was to be executed, a  postponement had been granted on account of her approaching  accouchement. Afterwards, \"nobody insisting in the pursute of her, she  was set at libertie.\" It seems also that the jury that had before  condemned her had acquitted her of the main charge, that of treasonable  witchcraft against the king. The king was angered at the default of  justice, went to the Tolbooth, and made an address on the subject. He  spoke of \"his own impartiality, the use of witchcraft, the enormity of  the crime, ... the ignorance of thinking such matters mere fantasies,  the cause of his own interference in the matter, the ignorance of the  assizes in the late trial, his own opinion of what witches really  are.\"[3]    It was only a few years later that James put that opinion into written  form. All the world knows that the king was a serious student. With  unremitting zeal he studied this matter, and in 1597, seven years after  the Dr. Fian affair, he published his _Daemonologie_.[4] It was expressly  designed to controvert the \"damnable opinions of two principally in our  age\"--Scot, who \"is not ashamed in publick Print to deny that there can  be such a thing as witchcraft,\" and Wierus, \"a German physician,\" who  \"sets out a publicke apologie for all these craft-folkes whereby ... he  plainly bewrayes himself to have been one of that profession.\"    It was to be expected that James would be an exponent of the current  system of belief. He had read diligently, if not widely, in the  Continental lore of the subject and had assimilated much of it. He was  Scotch enough to be interested in theology and Stuart enough to have  very definite opinions. James had, too, his own way of putting things.  There was a certain freshness about his treatment, in spite of the fact  that he was ploughing old fields. Nothing illustrates better his  combination of adherence to tradition, of credulity, and of originality  than his views on the transportation of witches, a subject that had long  engaged the theorists in demonology. Witches could be transported, he  believed, by natural means, or they could be carried through the air \"by  the force of the spirit which is their conducter,\" as Habakkuk was  carried by the angel.[5] This much he could accept. But that they could  be transformed into a \"little beast or foule\" and pierce through  \"whatsoever house or Church, though all ordinarie passages be closed,\"  this he refused to believe. So far, however, there was nothing original  about either his belief or his disbelief. But his suggestion on another  matter was very probably his own. There had been long discussion as to  how far through the air witches could go. It was James's opinion that  they could go only so far as they could retain their breath.    But it was seldom that the royal demonologist wandered far from the  beaten road. He was a conformist and he felt that the orthodox case  needed defence: so he set about to answer the objectors. To the argument  that it was a strange thing that witches were melancholy and solitary  women (and so, he would have explained, offer the easiest object of  attack) he interposed a flat denial: they are \"some of them rich and  worldly-wise, some of them fat or corpulent in their bodies.\" To the  point that if witches had the power ascribed to them no one but  themselves would be left alive in the world, he answered that such would  be the case, were not the power of the Devil bridled by God. To the plea  that God would not allow his children to be vexed by the Devil, he  replied that God permits the godly who are sleeping in sin to be  troubled; that He even allows the Evil One to vex the righteous for his  own good--a conventional argument that has done service in many a  theological controversy.    It is a curious circumstance that James seemingly recognized the  reliability of the Romish exorcisms which the Church of England was  about that time beginning to attack. His explanation of them is worthy  of \"the wisest fool in Christendom.\" The Papists could often effect  cures of the possessed, he thought, because \"the divell is content to  release the bodily hurting of them, ... thereby to obtain the perpetual  hurt of the soules.\"    That James should indulge in religious disquisitions rather than in  points of evidence was to be expected. Although he had given up the  Scottish theology, he never succeeded in getting it thoroughly out of  his system. As to the evidence against the accused, the royal writer was  brief. Two sorts of evidence he thought of value, one \"the finding of  their marke, and the trying the insensiblenes thereof, the other is  their fleeting [floating] on the water.\" The latter sign was based, he  said, on the fact that the water refuses to receive a witch--that is to  say, the pure element would refuse to receive those who had renounced  their baptism.[6] We shall see that the influence of the _Daemonologie_  can be fairly appraised by measuring the increased use of these two  tests of guilt within his own reign and that of his son. Hitherto the  evidence of the mark had been of rather less importance, while the  ordeal by water was not in use.    The alleged witch-mark on the body had to do with the contracts between  witches and the Devil. This loathsome side of witch belief we cannot go  into. Suffice it to say that James insisted on the reality of these  contracts and consequently upon the punishment that should be meted to  those who had entered into them. All witches except children should be  sentenced to death. The king shows a trace of conventional moderation,  however, and admits that the magistrates should be careful whom they  condemned. But, while he holds that the innocent should not be  condemned, he warns officials against the sin of failing to convict the  guilty.[7] We shall see that throughout his reign in England he pursued  a course perfectly consistent with these principles.    A critical estimate of James's book it is somewhat hard to give.  Students of witchcraft have given utterance to the most extravagant but  widely divergent opinions upon it. The writer confesses that he has not  that acquaintance with the witch literature of the Continent which would  enable him to appraise the _Daemonologie_ as to its originality. So good  an authority as Thomas Wright has declared that it is \"much inferior to  the other treatises on the subject,\" and that it was compiled from  foreign works.[8] Doubtless a study of the Continental literature would  warrant, at least in part, this opinion. Yet one gets the impression,  from what may be learned of that great body of writing through the  historians of witchcraft, that James's opinions were in some respects  his own. He had, of course, absorbed the current belief, but he did not  hesitate to give his own interpretation and explanation of phenomena.  That interpretation is not wanting in shrewdness. It seems to one who  has wandered through many tedious defences of the belief in witchcraft  that James's work is as able as any in English prior to the time of  Joseph Glanvill in 1668. One who should read Glanvill and James together  would get a very satisfactory understanding of the position of the  defenders of the superstition. Glanvill insisted upon what he believed  were well authenticated facts of experience. James grounded his belief  upon a course of theoretical reasoning.    We have already indicated that James's book was influential in its time.  It goes without saying that his position as a sovereign greatly enhanced  its influence. This was particularly true after he took the throne of  England. The dicta that emanated from the executive of the English  nation could not fail to find a wide audience, and especially in England  itself. His work offered a text-book to officials. It was a key to the  character and methods of the new ruler, and those who hoped for  promotion were quick to avail themselves of it. To prosecute witches was  to win the sovereign's approval. The judges were prompted to greater  activity. Moreover, the sanction of royalty gave to popular outbreaks  against suspicious women greater consideration at the hands of the  gentry. And it was in the last analysis the gentry, in the persons of  the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31529"],[0,"Modern marriage and how to bear it (#20)"],[1,"would be simple enough. But Amoret has truly called  this problem 'the _cul-de-sac_ of all reforms.' Any system, whatever its  form, whether leasehold marriage, free love, polygamy, polyandry, or  duogamy--any scheme that tends to confuse the fatherhood of the child,  or deprive the child of the solid advantages of a permanent home--is  hopeless from the start. This, however, obviously applies only to the  couples who have children. Formerly those who married expected to have a  family, and were disappointed if this hope were not fulfilled. That it  was possible to limit the number of their offspring, or even to avoid  parenthood entirely, was of course unknown to them. Nowadays all this is  changed, and the doctrines of Malthus obtain everywhere.    Bernard Shaw says: 'The artificial sterilisation of matrimony is the  most revolutionary discovery of the nineteenth century.' It certainly  makes possible the revolutionary suggestions about marriage, or rather  _would_ make them more feasible if the 'discovery' were universally put  into practice.    Let us take it then, that where children are desired no relaxation of  our present marriage system is advisable, and that people who wish to  experiment in new matrimonial schemes must resolutely avoid the  '_cul-de-sac_ of all reforms,' and remain childless.    To beget or not to beget--that is the question nowadays, and a very  vexed question it is. There is hardly a subject on which opinions are  more diversified. Some people regard parenthood as the most horrible  disaster; others think that to die without creating is to have lived  uselessly. I heard a woman say once: 'I hate children; it's much better  to keep a few dear dogs,' and she was not an ignorant or devitalised  girl, but a healthy, sensible, fully developed young woman of  six-and-twenty. Not long ago another woman, in announcing her engagement  to me, added in the same breath that she didn't mean to have children on  any account. Mr George Moore, in that sinister and repulsive book, _The  Confessions of a Young Man_ says: 'That I may die childless, that when  my hour comes I may turn my face to the wall, saying, I have not  increased the great evil of human life--then, though I were murderer,  fornicator, thief, and liar, my sins shall melt even as a cloud. But he  who dies with children about him, though his life were in all else an  excellent deed, shall be held accursed by the truly wise, and the stain  upon him shall endure for ever.' (One wonders on reading this why Mr  Moore continues to perpetuate the great evil of human life in his own  person, when he could so easily end his existence without paining  anyone!)    But I have heard many people, both men and women, married and single,  say that without children marriage is meaningless, in which opinion I  heartily concur. More than one young woman dowered with generous blood,  vitality, and courage has confided in me that whether she should marry  or not she wished to be a mother at all costs. It is one of the  disastrous results of men's shrinking from matrimony that fine women  like these must deliberately stifle this glorious passion of motherhood,  or pay a terrible price for expressing it--a price exacted not only from  themselves but from the child to whom they have given life. Such women,  however, are not often met with.    And now we come to the reason why people do not want children. 'We can't  afford it' is the plea most frequently heard, and a despicably selfish  one it is. I have said previously that every man can afford to  marry--when he meets the right woman. To this I add that every man who  can afford a wife can also afford a child. People who are too selfish to  afford a couple of children (or at least one, sad though it be for the  youngster to have neither brother nor sister) ought not to marry at all.  Some people say they are happy enough without little ones. A good many  women deliberately forgo their prospect of motherhood because it would  interrupt their pleasures, spoil the hunting season, interfere with  their desire to travel or their craze for games. Perhaps some day they  may think too high a price was paid for indulgence in these hobbies.  Others honestly dislike children, and would be entirely at a loss in  possessing them. It is as well that such people should have none: the  poor little unwanted ones can always be recognised.    'Delicacy' is another plea put forward by neurotic women who are not one  whit too delicate to bear a child. Where the ill-health is genuine, or  some constitutional weakness or disorder is present, of course this plea  is sensible enough. An apparently sane woman once told me quite  seriously that she would have liked a child, only she often had a bad  cough in the winter, and would not risk the possibility of 'handing it  on.' Her lungs were perfectly sound, it was merely a temporary cough  that troubled her. On the same occasion another woman present remarked  that she too would have liked a child, only 'there wouldn't be room in  our flat, and it is so convenient, we shouldn't like to leave it.' My  state of mind on hearing these remarks could only have been adequately  expressed by knocking these two ladies down and trampling on them, and  as this course would not have found favour with our hostess, I had to  content myself with merely being rather rude to them.    I believe the root of the whole matter is that the maternal instinct is  not so general as formerly. The causes for this I am not wise enough to  determine. It may be due to the greater enfranchisement of women, the  widening of women's lives and ambitions, the new occupations, the new  interests which have so transformed feminine existence. Maternity and  the grievous and irksome processes of its accomplishment are apt to  interfere with all this. The instinct of motherhood is still doubtless  innate in the majority; when the babies come, often unwelcome, the  instinct reasserts itself as a rule, but it is certainly not general for  the average woman of to-day to feel it stirring before marriage or  actual motherhood, and I honestly believe that the number of women who,  like the female bee, are utterly without this instinct is yearly  increasing. It has often occurred to me that men are really fonder of  children than are women. In my own experience, I hardly know a man who  does not love them, whereas I know many women who positively detest  children, and many others who only endure their own because they must.  I have also observed that quite devoted mothers dislike all other  children, whereas men, if fond of the little ones at all, seem fond of  every child. Note the attention men will pay a not particularly  attractive child in a railway carriage, whilst the women present are  entirely indifferent to it. A lady who has kept a girls' school for many  years told me recently that in her opinion the very nature of girls  seems changing, and love of dolls and babies is apparently decaying.  Can this be generally true? Is it possible that the higher education of  women has such grave drawbacks?    Fortunately for the honour and ideals of our country, the  philoprogenitive element is still in an overwhelming majority and many  people who for various reasons do not actually want children are ready  enough to welcome the Stork if he does elect to pay them a visit. In  after years they will tell one that they can't imagine what life would  have been like without the noise of little feet throughout the house,  the clamour of little voices, the tender faces of little children.            II      THE PROS AND CONS OF THE LIMITED FAMILY      'The child--Heaven's gift.' --TENNYSON.      On the other hand, though I think it the greatest possible mistake for  legally married people to intentionally remain childless, for any reason  other than mental or physical degeneration, I am strongly against the  Lutheran doctrine of unlimited families. Times have changed since  Luther's day, and the necessity for small families is fairly obvious in  the twentieth century for all but very wealthy people. Where money is no  object, and the parents are thoroughly robust, the great luxury of a  large family may be indulged in. And it _is_ a luxury, let cynics sneer  as they choose. We modern parents with our two and three children, or  our one ewe lamb who can scarcely be trusted out of our sight because he  is our unique creative effort--we miss much of the real domestic joy  that our mothers and fathers must have known, with their baker's dozen  or so of lusty boys and girls. Our children can't even get up a set of  tennis among themselves without borrowing one or more from another  household. Much of the anxiety and worry we suffer over our rare  offspring was unknown in the days when blessings were numerous, and  families ran into two figures as a matter of course.    Nowadays these joys are the luxuries of the wealthy, who, however,  rarely avail themselves of this special privilege of riches. With the  necessities of life getting dearer every year, a continual panic in the  money market, and the pressure of competition assuming nightmare  proportions--a small family of two or three children is all the man of  moderate income can allow himself. Four is an outside number, but it is  worth making some sacrifices to attain it. Professor E. A. Ross has  recently stated in _The American Journal of Sociology_ that although  restriction 'results in diffusion of economic well-being; lessens infant  mortality; ceases population pressure, which is the principal cause of  war, mass poverty, wolfish competition and class conflict,' yet there  are 'disquieting effects, and in one-child or two-child families both  parents and children miss many of the best lessons of life; the type to  be standardised is not the family of one to three but the family of four  to six.' The German scientist, Moebius, has also stated his opinion that"]]]
