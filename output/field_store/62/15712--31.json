Guayabo is in the known range of _U. gadowi_. _Urosaurus  irregularis_ is known only from the type specimen in the Bremen Museum;  the type locality, according to Fischer (1882:232), is \"Aus dem  Hochlande von Mexico.\" If an examination of the type specimen of _U.  irregularis_ shows it to be identical with _U. gadowi_, then _U.  irregularis_ would be the name for the lizards here referred to _U.  gadowi_.      ~Mabuya brachypoda~ Taylor         _Mabuya brachypoda_ Taylor, Univ. Kansas Sci. Bull., 38       (1):308, December 20, 1956.--Four kilometers east-southeast       of Los Angeles de Tilaran, Guanacaste, Costa Rica.         El Sabino (42); La Placita; Playa Azul; Tzitzio (3).    Previously this species has been reported from La Placita as _Mabuya  mabouya alliacea_ by Peters (1954:15). Webb (1958:1311) provided  evidence that Mexican specimens were conspecific with _Mabuya  brachypoda_, as described from Costa Rica by Taylor (1956:308). The  large series in the Taylor collection studied by Webb and listed by him  as being from Uruapan actually is part of a series collected by Hobart  M. Smith at El Sabino at an elevation of 1050 meters, 30 kilometers  south of Uruapan.    This species probably ranges throughout the coastal region of the state;  individuals from La Placita and Playa Azul were taken in dense scrub  forest near sea level.      ~Scincella assata taylori~ (Oliver)         _Leiolopisma assatum taylori_ Oliver, Occ. Pap. Mus. Zool.       Univ. Michigan, 360:12, November 20, 1937.--Santiago,       Colima, Mexico.         _Scincella assata taylori_, Mittleman, Herpetologica, 6:20,       June 5, 1950.         Twenty-one km. S of Arteaga; Ostula.    The specimen from Ostula was obtained in semi-deciduous broad-leaf  forest at an elevation of 120 meters; that from 21 kilometers south of  Arteaga was taken in oak forest at an elevation of 830 meters. Both  localities are on the coastal slopes of the Sierra de Coalcoman.  Probably the species inhabits the heavy forests on the lower slopes of  these mountains. The specimen from south of Arteaga (UMMZ 119117) in  life had a tan dorsum and a bright orange-pink tail.      ~Eumeces altamirani~ Duges         _Eumeces altamirani_ Duges, La Naturaleza, ser. 2, 1:485,       1891.--Apatzingan, Michoacan, Mexico.         Twelve km. E of Apatzingan; El Sabino (4).    One specimen of this rare species was found beneath a rock in the open  scrub forest 12 kilometers east of Apatzingan on July 3, 1955. Another  skink, presumably of this species, was seen at Capirio. The specimen  from east of Apatzingan is a male having a snout-vent length of 97 mm.  and an incomplete tail. In most respects it compares favorably with  accounts of the species given by Taylor (1936b:55 and 1936c:102). The  frontal is divided by a transverse suture; the enlarged dorsal scales  are arranged in 11 pairs anteriorly, followed by 48 unpaired enlarged  scales. The head and middorsal area are brown; there is a pale tan  stripe on the edges of the vertebral and paravertebral rows, bordered by  a dark brown stripe on the paravertebral row, which, in turn, is  bordered by a pale tan stripe on the lateral edge of the paravertebral  scale row and the median edge of the adjacent scale row. The stripes  extend from the neck to the base of the tail. The flanks are mottled  with brown and cream-color; the labials are cream-color barred by brown;  the venter is a pale cream-color.    Duges (1891:485) described _Eumeces altamirani_ from \"las regiones  calidas del Estado de Michoacan\" and subsequently (1896:480) gave  Apatzingan as a locality for the species. Presumably he had only one  specimen. In 1935 Hobart M. Smith collected the species at El Sabino on  the lower slopes of the Cordillera Volcanica bordering the Tepalcatepec  Valley. All of the known specimens are from this valley and the adjacent  slopes, an area to which the species apparently is endemic.      ~Eumeces colimensis~ Taylor         _Eumeces colimensis_ Taylor, Publ. Field Mus. Nat. Hist.,       zool. ser., 20:77, May 15, 1935.--Colima, Colima, Mexico.         Coalcoman; Salitre de Estopila.    The species was reported by Peters (1954:16); no additional material has  been discovered. The species is known only from foothills and low  mountains at elevations between 130 and 950 meters in Michoacan and  Colima.      ~Eumeces copei~ Taylor         _Eumeces copei_ Taylor, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 46:133,       June 5, 1933.--10 miles southeast of Asuncion, Mexico,       Mexico. Cerro Tancitaro (3); Zacapu.    This member of the _Eumeces brevirostris_-group has been found only in  pine or pine-fir forests at elevations from 1800 to 2700 meters. It  probably ranges throughout the high mountains of the state north of the  Tepalcatepec Valley; its apparent absence in other parts of the  Cordillera Volcanica, other than on Cerro Tancitaro, is surprising. The  species has been taken near Asuncion in the state of Mexico and at  Lagunas de Zempoala in Morelos.    In this species the lateral pale yellow stripe, which is bordered below  by dark brown, extends to the groin and onto the base of the tail. The  dorsolateral stripe is separated from the copper-colored middorsum by a  narrow brown stripe.      ~Eumeces dugesi~ Thominot         _Eumeces Dugesii_ Thominot, Bull. Soc. Philom. Paris, ser.       7, 7:138, 1883.--Guanajuato. Type locality restricted to       Guanajuato, Guanajuato, Mexico, by Smith and Taylor       (1950b:169).         Carapan (6); Cheran (5); Opopeo (2); 17 km. S of Patzcuaro       (3); San Jose de la Cumbre (2); Tancitaro (2);       Tangancicuaro; Uruapan; Zacapu.    Individuals of this species frequently have been found beneath rocks and  logs in pine-oak, pine, or fir forests from elevations of 1550 to 1850  meters. To judge from specimens available, _E. dugesi_ probably is the  most abundant and widespread species of skink in the state.    In this species the lateral yellow stripe is indistinct and is  persistent only in the axilla; the dorsolateral stripes terminate  anterior to the hind limbs and are not separated from the tan dorsum.      ~Eumeces indubitus~ Taylor         _Eumeces indubitus_ Taylor, Univ. Kansas Sci. Bull., 21:257,       November 27, 1934.--Near Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico.         Puerto Hondo.    The one specimen of this species from Michoacan was collected by Edward  H. Taylor in pine forest at Puerto Hondo, near Zitacuaro, at an  elevation of about 2750 meters (Taylor, 1935:466). The species is known  from the high mountains of eastern Michoacan, western Mexico, and  northern Morelos.      ~Eumeces parvulus~ Taylor         _Eumeces parvulus_ Taylor, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington,       46:175, October 26, 1933.--Tepic, Nayarit, Mexico.         El Ticuiz; La Placita; Pomaro (2); San Pedro Naranjestila       (3).    Aside from the specimens reported by Peters (1954:17), one other  specimen was obtained at El Ticuiz. It has 22 scale rows, 3 supraoculars  in contact with the frontal, 2 postlabials, and a unicolored olive-tan  dorsum. In life the anterior dorsolateral stripes were pale pinkish tan,  the labials cream color, the throat white, and the tail pale blue. All  specimens were found in semi-deciduous broad-leaf forest at elevations  of less than 500 meters on the seaward slopes of the Sierra de  Coalcoman.      ~Ameiva undulata sinistra~ Smith and Laufe         _Ameiva undulata sinistra_ Smith and Laufe, Univ. Kansas       Sci. Bull., 31 (1):59, May 1, 1946.--Manzanillo, Colima,       Mexico.         Apatzingan (9); 19 km. S of Arteaga (3); Barranca de Bejuco       (2); Coahuayana (6); Coalcoman (3); El Ticuiz (10); La       Placita (2); Limoncito (3); Ostula (2); Playa Azul; Salitre       de Estopila; San Juan de Lima (2); San Pedro Naranjestila       (4).    Six males and six females from the Tepalcatepec Valley have more femoral  pores than do 16 males and nine females from the coastal lowlands; the  ranges and average number of femoral pores in the former are 40-50  (44.8) for males and 38-40 (38.6) for females; males from the coast have  34-44 (39.2), and females have 32-40 (36.2) femoral pores. In all  specimens the number of lamellae beneath the fourth toe varies from 26  to 33 (29.7). In life juveniles have a pale olive-tan dorsum and a  dorsolateral dark band, superimposed on which is a row of darker brown  spots. The dorsolateral band is bordered below by a narrow cream-colored  stripe. The tail is tan above and grayish white below; the belly is pale  bluish white. Adult males are brilliantly colored in life. A male having  a snout-vent length of 108 mm. had a rusty brown dorsum and bright blue  bars on the flanks separated by dark brown interspaces. The side of the  head was pale green, and the chin and throat were golden yellow. In some  specimens the throat is orange. Juveniles and subadults have dark flecks  on the brown or tan middorsal area, but these are absent in the largest  males.    This species inhabits the heavily wooded areas in the lowlands to  elevations of about 950 meters. In the Tepalcatepec Valley it has been  found only in gallery forests along streams. In both the Tepalcatepec  Valley and the coastal lowlands there is a noticeable absence of large  adults in the dry season.      ~Cnemidophorus calidipes~ Duellman         _Cnemidophorus calidipes_ Duellman, Occ. Pap. Mus. Zool.       Univ. Michigan, 574:1, December 23, 1955.--Capirio,       Michoacan, Mexico.         Apatzingan (56); 12-20 km. S of Apatzingan (5); 19 km. E of       Apatzingan (5); 25 km. S of Arteaga; Capirio (57); El       Espinal (13); Jazmin (9); 11 km. S of Lombardia; Nueva       Italia.    This small, distinctive species of the _sexlineatus_-group of  _Cnemidophorus_ was discovered in the Tepalcatepec Valley in 1955  (Duellman, 1955); subsequent field studies showed it to be widespread in  the valley (Duellman, 1960c). One specimen (KU 29747) is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33619"],[0,"Maori and Settler: A Story of The New Zealand War (#20)"],[1,"canoes. I believe they bring them down by fire.  However, it is as well to humour them. Tell the carpenter to bring half  a dozen axes.\"    This was done, and the axes laid down on the deck. There was now a  consultation between the natives. After a while they nodded, and then  made signs that someone must go ashore with them to choose the tree.    \"What do you say, Ryan?\" the captain asked. \"It is of importance that we  should get a stick that will suit us. The question is whether it will be  safe to trust a man on shore with these scoundrels?\"    \"I will go ashore if you like, captain,\" Mr. Ryan replied.    \"I do not like it, Ryan,\" the captain said. \"You see, they would make  mincemeat of an armed crew in no time.\"    \"I should not propose to take a crew, sir; they could afford no  protection against a number of natives. I do not think the beggars would  assault a single man. You see, there would be nothing to gain by it; and  if they did it would put the ship on its guard, and their game at  present is evidently to be friendly. I do not think there is any danger  in the affair. If I did not go they might send off some stick that would  be of no use at all to us, and as we came in on purpose to get a mast it  is worth while risking something.\"    \"Well, Ryan,\" the captain said after a moment's deliberation, \"I think  perhaps you are right, and that one man would be safe with them. It is  certainly of great importance for us to get the sort of stick we want,  so as you are ready to volunteer I do not think myself justified in  refusing your offer.\" The captain then put his hand on the chief  officer's shoulder and intimated to the natives that he would accompany  them on shore. The party then returned to the poop, and the steward  brought up some tumblers and two or three bottles of rum. The chiefs'  eyes glistened as the liquor was poured out, and each swallowed a half  tumbler of the spirit with an air of the deepest satisfaction.    \"That is the present they like best,\" the captain said; \"and I suppose I  had better give them some for consumption on shore. At any rate it will  keep them in a good temper until Ryan is back again.\" Accordingly two  bottles of rum were presented to the leading chief, a bottle to the  three next in rank, and two or three bottles among the others. The great  canoe was hailed, the natives again took their places in it, accompanied  by the first officer, and the boat then started for the shore. Some of  the smaller craft now came alongside, and the process of barter was  again commenced. Yams, bread-fruit, and other products of the island  were obtained for the use of the ship in exchange for beads, empty  bottles, and small mirrors, while the passengers succeeded in obtaining  many curiously carved weapons, calabashes, woven cloths, and other  mementoes of their visit. Only two or three of the canoes were allowed  alongside at a time, and a vigilant look-out was maintained to see that  the others did not approach the ship. The captain walked restlessly up  and down the poop, constantly turning his glass upon the shore.    An hour after the great canoe had reached it he exclaimed in a tone of  intense satisfaction, \"There is Ryan coming down to the beach. Thank  heaven he is safe!\" The first-mate was seen to take his place in a small  canoe, which at once rowed off to the ship. The captain shook him  heartily by the hand as he stepped on deck. \"Thank heaven you have got  back safely, Ryan! it has been a hazardous business, and I shall take  care to let the owners know how you have risked your life by going  ashore in their service. Well, how have you succeeded?\"    \"I found a grand pine growing within thirty or forty yards of the water,  about a quarter of a mile beyond that point to the left. As I expected,  the natives had no idea of using the axes for such a purpose. When I  left them a party were piling wood round the foot of the tree, and I  have no doubt they will soon get it down in their own way. I suppose  they will waste ten or twelve feet at the base, but that is of no  consequence, for the tree is long enough and to spare to make us a  fair-sized mainmast.\"    \"That is right; and as it is so close to the water we can send a boat to  see how they are getting on. How about water?\"    \"They showed me a spring about fifty yards from the beach, nearly facing  us. There is plenty of water there, and it is perfectly fresh and sweet,  for I tasted it. If they make any bother about bringing it off, a couple  of boats with well-armed parties could fetch it without difficulty as  the distance is so short.\"    \"That is capital, Ryan. I hope our difficulties are pretty well over,  and that we shall get off without any trouble with these fellows.\"    \"I hope so, sir. They certainly seemed friendly enough with me on  shore.\"    In the evening Mr. Ryan, with a crew of six men, went in the captain's  gig to see how the natives were getting on with the tree. The men had  their muskets and cutlasses laid under the thwarts in readiness for  action. The natives, however, appeared perfectly friendly. The crews of  several of the canoes near which they passed shouted some sort of  greeting, but paid no other attention to them. On rounding the point the  first officer steered straight for the tree he had chosen. A light smoke  was ascending from its foot, and half a dozen natives were gathered  there. When close to the spot he ordered the men to turn the boat round  and back her ashore.    \"I am going to land, lads,\" he said, \"and see how they are getting on. I  do not think that there is the least danger, but you had best keep in  readiness to row off the instant I jump on board.\"    Mr. Ryan then proceeded to the tree. He found that a circle of small  fires had been built against it. These were fed with dry wood, and were  slowly but steadily eating their way into the tree, and he saw that only  two or three feet of the base would be injured by their action. He  nodded approvingly to the natives, but muttered to himself: \"It's a  mighty slow way of bringing down a tree. It is not much above three feet  and a half in diameter, even at the base, and a couple of men with axes  would bring it down in an hour, while there is no saying how long they  will be with these fires of theirs. However, I should say that they will  get through it to-night or some time to-morrow. It is a fine stick, and  runs up as straight as an arrow, and is thick enough for fifty feet for  our purpose.\"    He walked quietly back to the boat, took his seat, and was rowed back to  the ship, where he reported that the natives were carrying out their  promise, and that by the next day the tree would be down. On visiting  the spot again on the following morning it was found that the tree had  fallen.    \"The fellows know their business,\" Mr. Ryan said to the man who rowed  the stroke-oar. \"You see that they managed so that it should fall  towards the water. Now, lads, you can take to the axes we have brought  with us and chop it through at the point where we want it cut; it will  save the trouble of getting off the upper branches, and render it much  more handy for getting afloat.\"    Leaving two of the men in the boat, Mr. Ryan and the other four leapt  ashore, and were not long in cutting through the tree. Another half-hour  sufficed to lop off all the branches below this point, and the trunk was  then ready for launching. The natives stood round watching the work with  exclamations of surprise at the speed with which the keen axes did their  work. Mr. Ryan had brought with him from the ship a number of presents,  and these he distributed among the party who had been engaged in felling  the tree.    \"I do not know,\" he said to the captain when he returned, \"whether they  mean to get the stick in the water and bring it here, or whether they  expect we shall do that part of the business ourselves.\"    \"I think we will wait until to-morrow morning, Mr. Ryan. If we hear  nothing of them by then you had better take two boats--one with men to  do the work, the other to lie just off and protect them while they do  it.\"    There was, however, no occasion for this, for early the next morning  seven or eight canoes were seen coming round the point with much beating  of tom-toms and sounding of conch horns.    \"Here comes the spar!\" the captain exclaimed; \"the worst of our  difficulties is over, thank goodness!\"    \"I would keep an eye open, Ryan, if I were you,\" Mr. Atherton said as  the mate passed him to give orders for preparing to get the spar on  deck. \"There are a good many other canoes coming off from the shore,  and they might take the opportunity for making a sudden attack.\"    \"Right you are,\" the mate said. \"Let the starboard watch,\" he shouted,  \"keep their arms handy! Four men with muskets take their place at the  top of the gangway, but do not show the arms unless you get orders to do  so!\"    The trunk was towed alongside the ship. Mr. Atherton and the party who  had placed themselves under his orders kept a vigilant watch on the  canoes to see if the occupants were armed. There was a deal of talking  and gesticulating going on among them, but no arms could be seen, and  Mr. Atherton soon concluded that if treachery was intended the present  was not the time at which it would be shown. The crew were all on deck,  and the natives must have known their arms were close at hand, for each  day a few of those who came to trade had been permitted to come on deck,  partly to show confidence on the part of those on board, partly that the  visitors might see the arms lying in readiness for use, and be able to  report on shore that the ship was not to be taken by surprise.    No sooner was the spar alongside than a couple of sailors lowered  themselves down and passed ropes round it. These ropes were then passed  through blocks and taken to the capstan. The bars were fitted and seized  by a dozen men. The boatswain's"]]]
