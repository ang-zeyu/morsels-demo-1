Christopher, executed in 1515,  very finely coloured, but not exempt from some inaccuracies. The other  bears the date of 1535, representing S. Mark in the act of consecrating  a bishop, along with other saints, and with perspective; a piece, says  its author, _posta in opera, non finita_, begun, indeed, but not  finished. A more complete specimen was to be seen at San Pier Martire di  Udine, in his Annunciation, since re-touched and destroyed. Some there  are who have preferred, before every other, that preserved in S. Maria  dell'Orto, at Venice. It consists of San Lorenzo Giustiniani, surrounded  by various saints; among whom S. John the Baptist appears naked  according to the rules of the most learned schools; while the arm of S.  Augustine is seen, as it were, stretched forth out of the picture, an  effect of perspective this artist has repeated in various other places.  The most beautiful of his pieces in Piacenza, where he had established  himself, is his picture of the Marriage of S. Catherine, upon a dark  ground, which gives a roundness to the whole of the figures; it is full  of grace in those of a more tender character, and displays grandeur in  the forms of S. Peter and S. Paul, represented on the two sides; in the  last of whom, as well as in the S. Rocco of Pordenone, he gave a  portrait of himself.    But his works in fresco display the highest degree of merit; great part  of which he produced in the Friuli, besides numerous others scattered  throughout castles and villas, no longer distinguished by strangers,  except from the circumstance of possessing some painting of Pordenone.  Such places are Castions, Valeriano, Villanova, Varmo, Pallazuolo, where  he is with certainty known to have employed his talents. A few remnants  are likewise preserved in Mantua, in the Casa de' Cesarei, and in the  palazzo Doria, at Genoa; some at S. Rocco, and the cloisters of S.  Stefano, in Venice, and many specimens in high preservation in the dome  of Cremona, and at Santa Maria di Campagna, in Piacenza, where, in  collections, and in the facades of houses, other pieces of his are  pointed out. His labours in fresco, however, are not all equally studied  and correct; more particularly those in his native Friuli, which he  produced at an early age in great abundance, and for a small price. He  is more select in his male forms than in those of his women, whose model  he appears to have frequently taken from very robust rather than very  beautiful subjects, most probably met with in the adjacent province of  Carnia, where he is said to have indulged his early passions. But in  every thing he undertook we may invariably trace the workings of a  vigorous fancy, rich in conceiving, in varying, and developing his  ideas; powerful in his exhibition of the passions, displaying the  master-hand that encounters the difficulties of the art with the most  novel combinations in the science of foreshortening, with the most  laboured perspective, and with a power of relief which appears perfectly  starting from the canvass.    In Venice, he seemed to surpass all he had before done. The competition,  or rather enmity subsisting between him and Titian, served as a spur  both by day and night, to actuate him to fresh exertions. He was at  times even accustomed to paint with arms at his side; and it is the  opinion of many, that such emulation was of no less advantage to Titian,  than was the rivalship of Michelangiolo to Raffaello. In this instance,  also, the one excelled in strength, the other in grace of hand; or, as  it has been observed by Zanetti, nature prevailed in Titian in a  superior degree to manner, while in Pordenone both shone with an equal  degree of excellence. To have competed with Titian is a circumstance not  a little honourable to his name, and has acquired for him in the  Venetian School the second rank at least, in a period so prolific in  excellent artists. A portion of the people, indeed, then preferred him  to Titian; for, as I have elsewhere observed, there is nothing so well  calculated to surprise the multitude as the production of fine effect  and of the chiaroscuro, in which art he is known to have first preceded  Guercino. Pordenone was highly favoured, and presented with the title of  cavalier by Charles V.; and being subsequently invited to the court of  Ercole II. duke of Ferrara, he died there shortly after, not without  suspicion of having been poisoned. We have in the next place to give an  account of his school.    Bernardino Licinio, from his surname probably a relation of the  foregoing, was an artist who is here deserving of mention. We gather  from history, as well as from his manner, that he was also a pupil of  Pordenone; and there remains at the Conventuali, in Venice, an  altarpiece of the usual antique composition, quite in the style of the  other Licinio, from his hand. It is reported, likewise, that some of his  portraits are preserved in different collections which have been  erroneously ascribed to the elder Pordenone. Sandrart makes mention of  Giulio Licinio da Pordenone, a nephew and scholar to Gio. Antonio,  adding that he employed himself in Venice; thence transferred his  residence to Augusta, where he left behind him some truly surprising  specimens in fresco, which obtained for him with some a higher  reputation than his uncle. He would appear to be the same Giulio Lizino,  who, in competition with Schiavone, Paul Veronese, and other artists,  produced the three tondi, in the library of St. Mark, in the year 1556.  By Zanetti he is considered of Roman origin,[46] but this is a mistake,  arising from Giulio's having assumed the title of Romano during his  residence in the capital; while he retained it in Venice, the better to  distinguish him from the other _Licinj_, in the same manner as we have  already observed of one of the Trevisani, about the same period.    Giannantonio Licinio the younger, was a brother to Giulio, and more  commonly named Sacchiense, an artist who has been highly commended, but  whose works are no longer to be seen, not even in Como, as far as we can  learn, where he died.    After the Licinj we ought next to record the name of Calderari, a  distinguished pupil of Gio. Antonio, who has succeeded in sometimes  imposing upon the most acute judges. Thus it has occurred in the parish  church of Montereale, where he produced many scripture histories in  fresco, which had been uniformly ascribed to the hand of Pordenone,  until the discovery of a document establishing the contrary. He is even  little known in his native place of Pordenone, and his frescos in the  cathedral were attributed to the pencil of Amalteo. Pordenone may also  boast of another disciple in Francesco Beccaruzzi da Conigliano. For  this we have the authority of Ridolfi, confirmed by the artist's own  work, ornamenting his native place, of St. Francis in the act of  receiving the _stigmata_, or marks of Christ, a figure more striking in  point of relief than of colouring. To the same school has been added by  Orlandi, the name of Gio. Batista Grassi, a good painter, but more  excellent as an architect, and the same from whom Vasari drew his  notices of the painters of Friuli. I should be inclined, however, to  refer him to some other school, both on account of Vasari's silence on a  point so creditable to him, and his resemblance to the manner of Titian  in such of the few pieces as have been well preserved, and are exempt  from modern retouches of art. Of this kind are his pictures of the  Annunciation; the Translation of Elias; and the Vision of Ezekiel, in  the cathedral of Gemona, on the doors of the organ there.    The last name to be enumerated in this class, is that of Pomponio  Amalteo, a native of San Vito, and of a noble family which yet boasts  its descendants at Uderzo. He was one of the most excellent of  Giannantonio's pupils, and introduced his master's style into the  Friuli, for which reason we shall here give him a place, together with  the whole of his followers. He was son-in-law to Pordenone, and the  artist who succeeded him in his school at Friuli. Both there and in  other places he employed himself in works of distinguished merit. He  preserved the manner of his father-in-law, as has been observed by  Ridolfi, who erroneously ascribes to Licinio the Three Judgments,  indisputably the production of Amalteo, which he represented in a  gallery at Ceneda, in which causes are decided. They consist of the  Judgment of Solomon, of that of Daniel, and a third of Trajan; the whole  completed in the year 1536. It is everywhere evident that he aspired to  originality of manner; his shading is less strong, his colours are  brighter, and the proportions of his figures, and all his ideas are upon  a less elevated scale than those of his father-in-law. Some faint idea  of his works may be gathered from Vasari and Ridolfi, who omitted,  however, many of them, among others the five pictures of Roman histories  adorning the Hall of the Notaries at Belluno: but it is only some faint  idea, inasmuch as neither these two writers, nor Altan, who collected  memorials of him in a little work, were at all enabled to do full  justice to the labours of an artist who continued to occupy himself,  assisted by various other hands, until the latest period of his life.  Hence it is that the bulk of his works can by no means boast the same  degree of excellence as the Three Judgments we have mentioned, or the  picture of S. Francis, at the church of that name, in Udine, esteemed  one among the valuable pieces belonging to the city. Still, wherever or  upon whatever subject he employed himself, he displayed the powers of a  great master, educated by Pordenone; and one who not only shewed  himself, with"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3470"],[0,"Such Is Life (#20)"],[1,"prosaic,  but these were not compounded.  There was a dreamy, idealistic Rory,  born of a legend-loving race; and there was a painfully parsimonious Rory,  trained down to the standard of a model wealth-producer.  The first  was of imagination all compact, living in an atmosphere of charms, fairies,  poetic justice, and angelic guidance:  the second was primed with homely maxims  respecting the neglected value of copper currency.  Which reminds me----    We had been together about a week when the thresher came round.  I had no crop  of my own--the wild cattle having walked over the dog-leg fence, and eaten it  (the crop, of course, not the fence)--but we both went to help a neighbour.  I was deputed to sew the bags, and Rory to pull out the tailings  and bag them up for sending through again.  I noticed that the fan pulley  of the machine was secured with a home-made key, projecting about two inches  beyond the end of the shaft; and as this was close beside where Rory  was kneeling at his work, I pointed it out to him as a thing that meant  mischief to the unwary.  Half an hour afterward, there was a yell  from the vicinity of the fan, and I knew that the key had found Rory.  The engine driver shut off at once, and I made for the fan, whipping out  my pocket knife as I went.  The key had snatched the sleeve  of the young fellow's homespun linen shirt, midway between elbow and shoulder,  twitching the strong fabric into a knot, and burrowing into the soft meat  of his arm.  Already the fan was pulled up, while the belt slipped  and smoked on the drum pulley above.  The blade of my knife was just touching  the twisted nucleus of linen, when Rory exclaimed wildly,    \"Aisy, Tammas!  For marcy sake, don't!  Can't ye take the shurt aff the nail  without cuttin' it?\"    At this moment, the engine driver threw the fan belt off, and Rory  was soon liberated.  His satisfaction at finding the garment almost uninjured  was but slightly dashed by the bruise on his arm.  The latter would heal  of itself; the former would n't.  But for the rest of the day  he kept his eye on that key.    Among the few things he brought out with him from home was the old-fashioned  habit of sleeping in his skin--a usage, by the way, more to be commended  than the converse custom, practised by English coal-miners,  of turning into the blankets and out again fully dressed, till the raiment,  never removed, rots off by effluxion of time.  Rory maintained that his system  added considerably to the lifetime of a shirt.    However, one Sunday forenoon, while we were enjoying that second sleep  which gives to the Day of Rest its true significance, the smouldering fire  ate its way through the side of the log chimney, and caught a couple  of hundred two-foot shingles, stacked in the angle outside.  It was about  half-past ten when Rory was awakened by a crackling sound close beside him;  and the first sight he saw was a broad tongue of flame leaping in  under the eave, and licking the rafter above his head.    He had heard of bush fires; and though he knew the locusts were starving  on the surrounding plain, his roar of despair brought me to my feet  on the floor.  Immediately grasping the situation and a long-handled shovel,  I called on him to bring a bucket of water.  The barrel was empty,  as a matter of course; and Rory cantered away down the road a quarter  of a mile, to where a deep crab-hole--replenished by the rain  before referred to--furnished our supply.  But, in the panic of the moment,  it escaped his observation that he was affording a scandalous spectacle  to two spring-cartloads of assorted Cornish people, on their way to the local  tabernacle.  In fact, he had swooped up a bucket of water and turned back  with it before he was aware that they had been close behind him all the time.  His first thought was to squat down, taking cover behind the bucket; but,  remembering the exigency of his errand, he girded up his fortitude--  which was the only thing he had to gird--and faced the springcarts,  for the sake of my hut, as bravely as his ancestors had faced earcropping,  and similar cajoleries, for the sake of the wan thrue Church.  And there was  no more joke about the later martyrdom than about the earlier.  However,  by the time he returned, I had thrown the burning shingles to a safer distance,  and removed all the loose fire, so that the bucket of water  made everything safe.    Owing to the fire being on the side of the hut furthest from the road,  the church-goers never noticed it.  Hence they assumed that Rory was casually  bringing the water for domestic purposes; and their unavoidable inference  placed the Irish Catholics on a lower moral plane than the Aborigines,  by reason of their priests keeping them in ignorance.  This misconception  had acquired all the solidity of fact before it reached me; consequently,  my explanation was received as a well-meant fib.  Anyway, these details  will give you some idea of Rory, in his natural state as a colonist.    After the first fortnight or so, I frankly told him that, though nothing  would suit my own interests better than a lifelong extension of his assistance,  I would n't advise him to stay, as there could be no wages forthcoming.  I had absolutely no money, nor was I likely to have such a thing  in my possession till the forty-acre paddock was fenced, ploughed and sowed,  and the crop (if any) harvested and sold.  Even then--taking the average  of the district--I could n't expect a return of more than £100; and out of this  I would have to pay off an accumulated shortage of about £200.    \"It's a quare, quare counthry, anyhow,\" sadly soliloquised the exile of Erin,  after he had thought the matter over.  \"Wondhers'll niver quit saisin'.  At home, iv a body hed twenty English acres o' good lay lan', at a raisonable  rent--let alone a graat farrum like thon--he needn't do a han's turn  the year roun', beyant givin' ordhers; an' he would hev lavin's iv iverything,  an' a brave shoot o' clo'es till his back, an' mebbe a gool' watch,  furbye money in his pocket.  Bates all!  Bates all!\"    But the anomalous and baffling nature of Australian conditions made Rory  all the more reluctant to tear himself away from his present asylum--though  its shelter seemed to resemble the shadow of a great deficit  in an insolvent land.    So another fortnight passed, whilst each of us learned something  from the other.  I constantly endeavoured, by reminiscence and inference,  to post him up in the usages of his adopted country; and he regaled me  with the folk-lore of the hill-side where his ancestors had passively resisted  extinction since the time of Japhet.  Purposeless fairy tales and profitless  ghost stories for the most part, with another class of legend, equally fatuous;  but ah! how legitimately born of that auroral fancy which ceases  not to play above the grave of homely ambition, penury--crushed and dead!  Legends wherein the unvarying motif was a dazzling cash advance made by Satan  in pre-payment for the soul of some rustic dead-beat; delivery being due  in seven years from date.  And a clever repudiation of covenant,  with consequent non-forfeiture of ensuing clip, always came as a climax;  so that the defaulter lived happy ever after, while the outwitted speculator  retired to his own penal establishment in shame and confusion of tail.    At last a queer thing happened.  I received a letter, containing a bank draft  for £2, from a friend to whom I had lent the money three years before,  on the diggings.  In case there might have been some mistake about  the remittance, that draft was cashed before the postmaster had missed me  from the window, and I was on the way home before the bank manager thought  I was clear of his porch.  On the same evening, I placed one of the notes  in Rory's hand, adjuring him not to let the storekeeper know anything about it,  but to depart from me while he was safe.    He shrank from the note as from a lizard, while his lip quivered,  and he tried to swallow his emotion down.  Then ensued mutual expostulation,  which he terminated by producing a knitted purse, which might have belonged  to his grandfather--or to Brian Boru's grandfather, for that matter--  and disclosing a hidden treasure of seven shillings, two sixpences,  and ten coppers.  I nearly hit him in the mere fury of pity.  Ultimately,  however, my superior force of character told its tale, and we added the note  to his reserve fund.    I got him started next morning.  I gave him my Shakespear as a keepsake,  with a billy and pannikin, and a few days' rations.  I made up his swag  scientifically while he lay heart-broken on his bunk; then I walked with him  to the Echuca road.  So he sorrowed his way northward, in renewed search  of his brother Larry; and, as I watched his diminishing figure, I prayed  that he might be enticed into the most shocking company in Echuca,  and be made fightably drunk, and fall in for a remembersome hammering,  and get robbed of everything, and be given in charge for making a disturbance,  and wind up the adventure with a month in Her Majesty's jail.  It seemed to me  that no milder dispensation of Providence would satisfy his moral requirements.  Drastic, but such is life.    I had a letter from him a month afterward, but as the postmark was  hopelessly illegible, and as he had omitted to head the communication  with any address, and as he referred to the place where he was working  as \"the station,\" mentioning no names except those of his fellow-workmen,  I had to withhold the response for which his forlorn soul craved.    \"Takes a lot of different sorts of people to make a world,\" observed  Williamson, referring to the hero of my reminiscences.    \"Original remark,\" commented Ward.  \"And it seems to me that people's as much  alike as sheep; and Dan's just one of the flock.  I always speak of a man  as I find him.\"    \"Another original remark,\" said Broome.  \""]]]
