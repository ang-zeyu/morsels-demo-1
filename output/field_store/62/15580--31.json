Theodora Whitney has been badgering  Judith Stewart so much about bein' an old maid that Judith's got mad  and vowed she'll marry the first man that asks her.  Hee-tee-tee-hee-e-e-e! My old woman was there and heard her. She'll  keep her word, too. She ain't old Joshua Stewart's daughter for  nothin'. If he said he'd do a thing he did it if it tuck the hair  off. If I was a young feller now! Hee-tee-tee-hee-e-e-e!\"    Bruce Marshall swung round on one foot. His face was crimson and if  looks could kill, Tony Mack would have fallen dead in the middle of  his sniggers.    \"You needn't mind doing up that parcel for me,\" he said to Nora. \"I'll  not wait for it.\"    On his way to the door Eben King brushed past him. A shout of laughter  from the assembled men followed them. The others streamed out in their  wake, realizing that a race was afoot. Tony alone remained inside,  helpless with chuckling.    Eben King's horse was tied at the door. He had nothing to do but step  in and drive off. Bruce had put his mare in at Billy Bender's across  the bridge, intending to spend the evening there. He knew that this  would handicap him seriously, but he strode down the road with a  determined expression on his handsome face. Fifteen minutes later he  drove past the store, his gray mare going at a sharp gait. The crowd  in front of Plowden's cheered him, their sympathies were with him for  King was not popular. Tony had come out and shouted, \"Here's luck to  you, brother,\" after which he doubled up with renewed laughter. Such a  lark! And he, Tony, had set it afoot! It would be a story to tell for  years.    Marshall, with his lips set and his dreamy gray eyes for once  glittering with a steely light, urged Lady Jane up the Wexbridge hill.  From its top it was five miles to Ramble Valley by the main road. A  full mile ahead of him he saw Eben King, getting along through mud and  slush, and occasional big slumpy drifts of old snow, as fast as his  clean-limbed trotter could carry him. As a rule Eben was exceedingly  careful of his horses, but now he was sending Bay Billy along for all  that was in him.    For a second Bruce hesitated. Then he turned his mare down the field  cut to Malley's Creek. It was taking Lady Jane's life and possibly his  own in his hand, but it was his only chance. He could never have  overtaken Bay Billy on the main road.    \"Do your best, Lady Jane,\" he muttered, and Lady Jane plunged down the  steep hillside, through the glutinous mud of a ploughed field as if  she meant to do it.    Beyond the field was a ravine full of firs, through which Malley's  Creek ran. To cross it meant a four-mile cut to Ramble Valley. The ice  looked black and rotten. To the left was the ragged hole where Jack  Carr's mare had struggled for her life. Bruce headed Lady Jane higher  up. If a crossing could be made at all it was only between Malley's  spring-hole and the old ice road. Lady Jane swerved at the bank and  whickered.    \"On, old girl,\" said Bruce, in a tense voice. Unwillingly she  advanced, picking her steps with cat-like sagacity. Once her foot went  through, Bruce pulled her up with hands that did not tremble. The next  moment she was scrambling up the opposite bank. Glancing back, Bruce  saw the ice parting in her footprints and the black water gurgling up.    But the race was not yet decided. By crossing the creek he had won no  more than an equal chance with Eben King. And the field road before  him was much worse than the main road. There was little snow on it and  some bad sloughs. But Lady Jane was good for it. For once she should  not be spared.    Just as the red ball of the sun touched the wooded hills of the  valley, Mrs. Theodora, looking from the cowstable door, saw two  sleighs approaching, the horses of which were going at a gallop. One  was trundling down the main road, headlong through old drifts and  slumpy snow, where a false step might send the horse floundering to  the bottom. The other was coming up from the direction of the creek,  full tilt through Tony Mack's stump land, where not a vestige of snow  coated the huge roots over which the runners bumped.    For a moment Mrs. Theodora stood at a gaze. Then she recognized both  drivers. She dropped her milking pail and ran to the house, thinking  as she ran. She knew that Judith was alone in the kitchen. If Eben  King got there first, well and good, but if Bruce Marshall won the  race he must encounter her, Mrs. Theodora.    \"He won't propose to Judith as long as I'm round,\" she panted. \"I know  him--he's too shy. But Eben won't mind--I'll tip him the wink.\"    Potter Vane was chopping wood before the door. Mrs. Theodora  recognizing in him a further obstacle to Marshall's wooing, caught him  unceremoniously by the arm and hauled him, axe and all, over the  doorstone and into the kitchen, just as Bruce Marshall and Eben King  drove into the yard with not a second to spare between them. There was  a woeful cut on Bay Billy's slender foreleg and the reeking Lady Jane  was trembling like a leaf. The staunch little mare had brought her  master over that stretch of sticky field road in time, but she was  almost exhausted.    Both men sprang from their sleighs and ran to the door. Bruce Marshall  won it by foot-room and burst into the kitchen with his rival hot on  his heels. Mrs. Theodora stood defiantly in the middle of the room,  still grasping the dazed and dismayed Potter. In a corner Judith  turned from the window whence she had been watching the finish of the  race. She was pale and tense from excitement. In those few gasping  moments she had looked on her heart as on an open book; she knew at  last that she loved Bruce Marshall and her eyes met his fiery gray  ones as he sprang over the threshold.    \"Judith, will you marry me?\" gasped Bruce, before Eben, who had first  looked at Mrs. Theodora and the squirming Potter, had located the  girl.    \"Yes,\" said Judith. She burst into hysterical tears as she said it and  sat limply down in a chair.    Mrs. Theodora loosed her grip on Potter.    \"You can go back to your work,\" she said dully. She followed him out  and Eben King followed her. On the step she reached behind him and  closed the door.    \"Trust a King for being too late!\" she said bitterly and unjustly.    Eben went home with Bay Billy. Potter gazed after him until Mrs.  Theodora ordered him to put Marshall's mare in the stable and rub her  down.    \"Anyway, Judith won't be an old maid,\" she comforted herself.          The Promise of Lucy Ellen      Cecily Foster came down the sloping, fir-fringed road from the village  at a leisurely pace. Usually she walked with a long, determined  stride, but to-day the drowsy, mellowing influence of the Autumn  afternoon was strong upon her and filled her with placid content.  Without being actively conscious of it, she was satisfied with the  existing circumstances of her life. It was half over now. The half of  it yet to be lived stretched before her, tranquil, pleasant and  uneventful, like the afternoon, filled with unhurried duties and  calmly interesting days, Cecily liked the prospect.    When she came to her own lane she paused, folding her hands on the top  of the whitewashed gate, while she basked for a moment in the warmth  that seemed cupped in the little grassy hollow hedged about with young  fir-trees.    Before her lay sere, brooding fields sloping down to a sandy shore,  where long foamy ripples were lapping with a murmur that threaded the  hushed air like a faint minor melody.    On the crest of the little hill to her right was her home--hers and  Lucy Ellen's. The house was an old-fashioned, weather-gray one, low in  the eaves, with gables and porches overgrown with vines that had  turned to wine-reds and rich bronzes in the October frosts. On three  sides it was closed in by tall old spruces, their outer sides bared  and grim from long wrestling with the Atlantic winds, but their inner  green and feathery. On the fourth side a trim white paling shut in the  flower garden before the front door. Cecily could see the beds of  purple and scarlet asters, making rich whorls of color under the  parlor and sitting-room windows. Lucy Ellen's bed was gayer and larger  than Cecily's. Lucy Ellen had always had better luck with flowers.    She could see old Boxer asleep on the front porch step and Lucy  Ellen's white cat stretched out on the parlor window-sill. There was  no other sign of life about the place. Cecily drew a long, leisurely  breath of satisfaction.    \"After tea I'll dig up those dahlia roots,\" she said aloud. \"They'd  ought to be up. My, how blue and soft that sea is! I never saw such a  lovely day. I've been gone longer than I expected. I wonder if Lucy  Ellen's been lonesome?\"    When Cecily looked back from the misty ocean to the house, she was  surprised to see a man coming with a jaunty step down the lane under  the gnarled spruces. She looked at him perplexedly. He must be a  stranger, for she was sure no man in Oriental walked like that.    \"Some agent has been pestering Lucy Ellen, I suppose,\" she muttered  vexedly.    The stranger came on with an airy briskness utterly foreign to  Orientalites. Cecily opened the gate and went through. They met under  the amber-tinted sugar maple in the heart of the hollow. As he passed,  the man lifted his hat and bowed with an ingratiating smile.    He was about forty-five, well, although somewhat loudly dressed, and  with an air of self-satisfied prosperity pervading his whole  personality. He had a heavy gold watch chain and a large seal ring on  the hand that lifted his hat. He was bald, with a high, Shaksperian  forehead and a halo of sandy curls. His face was ruddy and weak, but  good-natured: his eyes were large and blue, and he had a little  straw-colored moustache, with a juvenile twist and curl in it.    Cecily did not"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24876"],[0,"Lucy Maud Montgomery Short Stories, 1905 to 1906 (#20)"],[1," had thought sorrowfully; and then  she had gone out and down the velvet-green springtime valley and over  the sunny birch hill beyond with a lagging step and a rebellious  heart.    But Jane Lavinia came home walking as if on the clear air of the  crystal afternoon, her small, delicate face aglow and every fibre of  her body and spirit thrilling with excitement and delight. She forgot  to fling the sailor hat into its box with her usual energy of dislike.  Just then Jane Lavinia had a soul above hats. She looked at herself in  the glass and nodded with friendliness.    \"You'll do something yet,\" she said. \"Mr. Stephens said you would. Oh,  I like you, Jane Lavinia, you dear thing! Sometimes I haven't liked  you because you're nothing to look at, and I didn't suppose you could  really do anything worthwhile. But I do like you now after what Mr.  Stephens said about your drawings.\"    Jane Lavinia smiled radiantly into the little cracked glass. Just then  she was pretty, with the glow on her cheeks and the sparkle in her  eyes. Her uncertainly tinted hair and an all-too-certain little tilt  of her nose no longer troubled her. Such things did not matter; nobody  would mind them in a successful artist. And Mr. Stephens had said that  she had talent enough to win success.    Jane Lavinia sat down by her window, which looked west into a grove of  firs. They grew thickly, close up to the house, and she could touch  their wide, fan-like branches with her hand. Jane Lavinia loved those  fir trees, with their whispers and sighs and beckonings, and she also  loved her little shadowy, low-ceilinged room, despite its plainness,  because it was gorgeous for her with visions and peopled with rainbow  fancies.    The stained walls were covered with Jane Lavinia's pictures--most of  them pen-and-ink sketches, with a few flights into water colour. Aunt  Rebecca sniffed at them and deplored the driving of tacks into the  plaster. Aunt Rebecca thought Jane Lavinia's artistic labours a flat  waste of time, which would have been much better put into rugs and  crochet tidies and afghans. All the other girls in Chestercote made  rugs and tidies and afghans. Why must Jane Lavinia keep messing with  ink and crayons and water colours?    Jane Lavinia only knew that she _must_--she could not help it. There  was something in her that demanded expression thus.    When Mr. Stephens, who was a well-known artist and magazine  illustrator, came to Chestercote because his wife's father, Nathan  Whittaker, was ill, Jane Lavinia's heart had bounded with a shy hope.  She indulged in some harmless manoeuvring which, with the aid of  good-natured Mrs. Whittaker, was crowned with success. One day, when  Mr. Whittaker was getting better, Mr. Stephens had asked her to show  him some of her work. Jane Lavinia, wearing the despised sailor hat,  had gone over to the Whittaker place with some of her best sketches.  She came home again feeling as if all the world and herself were  transfigured.    She looked out from the window of her little room with great dreamy  brown eyes, seeing through the fir boughs the golden western sky  beyond, serving as a canvas whereon her fancy painted glittering  visions of her future. She would go to New York--and study--and work,  oh, so hard--and go abroad--and work harder--and win success--and be  great and admired and famous--if only Aunt Rebecca--ah! if only Aunt  Rebecca! Jane Lavinia sighed. There was spring in the world and spring  in Jane Lavinia's heart; but a chill came with the thought of Aunt  Rebecca, who considered tidies and afghans nicer than her pictures.    \"But I'm going, anyway,\" said Jane Lavinia decidedly. \"If Aunt Rebecca  won't give me the money, I'll find some other way. I'm not afraid of  any amount of work. After what Mr. Stephens said, I believe I could  work twenty hours out of the twenty-four. I'd be content to live on a  crust and sleep in a garret--yes, and wear sailor hats with stiff bows  and blue roses the year round.\"    Jane Lavinia sighed in luxurious renunciation. Oh, it was good to be  alive--to be a girl of seventeen, with wonderful ambitions and all the  world before her! The years of the future sparkled and gleamed  alluringly. Jane Lavinia, with her head on the window sill, looked out  into the sunset splendour and dreamed.    Athwart her dreams, rending in twain their frail, rose-tinted fabric,  came Aunt Rebecca's voice from the kitchen below, \"Jane Lavinia! Jane  Lavinia! Ain't you going for the cows tonight?\"    Jane Lavinia started up guiltily; she had forgotten all about the  cows. She slipped off her muslin dress and hurried into her print; but  with all her haste it took time, and Aunt Rebecca was grimmer than  ever when Jane Lavinia ran downstairs.    \"It'll be dark before we get the cows milked. I s'pose you've been  day-dreaming again up there. I do wish, Jane Lavinia, that you had  more sense.\"    Jane Lavinia made no response. At any other time she would have gone  out with a lump in her throat; but now, after what Mr. Stephens had  said, Aunt Rebecca's words had no power to hurt her.    \"After milking I'll ask her about it,\" she said to herself, as she  went blithely down the sloping yard, across the little mossy bridge  over the brook, and up the lane on the hill beyond, where the ferns  grew thickly and the grass was beset with tiny blue-eyes like purple  stars. The air was moist and sweet. At the top of the lane a wild plum  tree hung out its branches of feathery bloom against the crimson sky.  Jane Lavinia lingered, in spite of Aunt Rebecca's hurry, to look at  it. It satisfied her artistic instinct and made her glad to be alive  in the world where wild plums blossomed against springtime skies. The  pleasure of it went with her through the pasture and back to the  milking yard; and stayed with her while she helped Aunt Rebecca milk  the cows.    When the milk was strained into the creamers down at the spring, and  the pails washed and set in a shining row on their bench, Jane Lavinia  tried to summon up her courage to speak to Aunt Rebecca. They were out  on the back verandah; the spring twilight was purpling down over the  woods and fields; down in the swamp the frogs were singing a silvery,  haunting chorus; a little baby moon was floating in the clear sky  above the white-blossoming orchard on the slope.    Jane Lavinia tried to speak and couldn't. For a wonder, Aunt Rebecca  spared her the trouble.    \"Well, what did Mr. Stephens think of your pictures?\" she asked  shortly.    \"Oh!\" Everything that Jane Lavinia wanted to say came rushing at once  and together to her tongue's end. \"Oh, Aunt Rebecca, he was delighted  with them! And he said I had remarkable talent, and he wants me to go  to New York and study in an art school there. He says Mrs. Stephens  finds it hard to get good help, and if I'd be willing to work for her  in the mornings, I could live with them and have my afternoons off. So  it won't cost much. And he said he would help me--and, oh, Aunt  Rebecca, can't I go?\"    Jane Lavinia's breath gave out with a gasp of suspense.    Aunt Rebecca was silent for so long a space that Jane Lavinia had time  to pass through the phases of hope and fear and despair and  resignation before she said, more grimly than ever, \"If your mind is  set on going, go you will, I suppose. It doesn't seem to me that I  have anything to say in the matter, Jane Lavinia.\"    \"But, oh, Aunt Rebecca,\" said Jane Lavinia tremulously. \"I can't go  unless you'll help me. I'll have to pay for my lessons at the art  school, you know.\"    \"So that's it, is it? And do you expect me to give you the money to  pay for them, Jane Lavinia?\"    \"Not give--exactly,\" stammered Jane Lavinia. \"I'll pay it back some  time, Aunt Rebecca. Oh, indeed, I will--when I'm able to earn money by  my pictures!\"    \"The security is hardly satisfactory,\" said Aunt Rebecca immovably.  \"You know well enough I haven't much money, Jane Lavinia. I thought  when I was coaxed into giving you two quarters' lessons with Miss  Claxton that it was as much as you could expect me to do for you. I  didn't suppose the next thing would be that you'd be for betaking  yourself to New York and expecting me to pay your bills there.\"    Aunt Rebecca turned and went into the house. Jane Lavinia, feeling  sore and bruised in spirit; fled to her own room and cried herself to  sleep.    Her eyes were swollen the next morning, but she was not sulky. Jane  Lavinia never sulked. She did her morning's work faithfully, although  there was no spring in her step. That afternoon, when she was out in  the orchard trying to patch up her tattered dreams, Aunt Rebecca came  down the blossomy avenue, a tall, gaunt figure, with an uncompromising  face.    \"You'd better go down to the store and get ten yards of white cotton,  Jane Lavinia,\" she said. \"If you're going to New York, you'll have to  get a supply of underclothing made.\"    Jane Lavinia opened her eyes.    \"Oh, Aunt Rebecca, am I going?\"    \"You can go if you want to. I'll give you all the money I can spare.  It ain't much, but perhaps it'll be enough for a start.\"    \"Oh, Aunt Rebecca, thank you!\" exclaimed Jane Lavinia, crimson with  conflicting feelings. \"But perhaps I oughtn't to take it--perhaps I  oughtn't to leave you alone--\"    If Aunt Rebecca had shown any regret at the thought of Jane Lavinia's  departure, Jane Lavinia would have foregone New York on the spot. But  Aunt Rebecca only said coldly, \"I guess you needn't worry over that. I  can get along well enough.\"    And with that it was settled. Jane Lavinia lived in a whirl of delight  for the next week. She felt few regrets at leaving Chestercote. Aunt  Rebecca would not miss her; Jane Lavinia thought that Aunt Rebecca  regarded her as a nuisance--a foolish girl who wasted her time making  pictures instead of doing something useful. Jane Lavinia had never  thought that Aunt Rebecca had any affection for her. She had been "]]]
