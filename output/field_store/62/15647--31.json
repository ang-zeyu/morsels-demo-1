Sanford Bell believes that at a certain period during childhood, namely,  between eight and twelve years of age, manifestations of love are less  noticeable than either earlier or later. He alleges as the reason of  this that at this particular age the child tends to conceal its fondness  from others, and perhaps even from the person beloved; hence it is  difficult during these years to observe the phenomena. According to this  view, the difference is apparent merely, and depends only upon greater  secretiveness. It may, indeed, be regarded as proved that in the course  of development, especially in the case of boys, there are certain years  during which children are less inclined to seek the company of those of  the opposite sex than either before or afterwards. This occurs  especially during the period of hobbledehoyhood, during which boys take  pleasure above all in rough sports. It has, indeed, been suggested that  this phenomenon has a teleological significance, that nature is here  pursuing a quite definite aim, to minimise by means of sexual antipathy  the danger attendant on the awakening of the sexual impulse. We must  not, however, over-value this self-help of the part of nature [if it  exists], since, if boys and girls avoid one another, the perverse  activities of the undifferentiated sexual impulse may very readily  appear in place of the suppressed heterosexual manifestations.    In the child, the moods of the amatory sentiment are exceedingly  variable. To-day, the love may be romantic in character; to-morrow, on  the other hand, rather sensual. To-day, a girl is enamoured of some  friend of her father's; to-morrow, she is in love with some little  friend of her brother's, or with one of her schoolmasters. A little  later, a member of her own sex becomes the object of passion, a  girl-friend of her own, or some actress of note. In general, especially,  too, when the stage of the undifferentiated impulse has not been  well-marked, we notice that as the years pass the inclination gradually  comes to relate to older persons. Since the period of childhood embraces  a comparatively small number of years, it is naturally not easy to  establish this point with mathematical precision; but I have been led to  form such an opinion by questioning a large number of persons of either  sex. In this respect we sometimes observe that which, in the _Satyricon_  of Petronius, Quartilla said long ago, when young Giton is united to the  seven-year-old Pannychis. In free phraseology, Quartilla assures us that  she has no remembrance of ever having been a virgin. \"When I was a  child, I made use of children for this purpose; as I became older,  bigger boys served my turn; and thus, from stage to stage, I attained my  present age.\"    Thus we can explain how it sometimes happens that a fondness conceived  in childhood may endure on into adult life, and may even culminate in  marriage. In large towns, indeed, such an occurrence is comparatively  rare, but in small towns and in the country, quite a number of instances  have been brought to my notice. As children, the two have grown up  together. Their reciprocal fondness originated long prior to the  formation of any conscious sexual sentiments; subsequently, when such  sentiments have arisen, and the sexual impulse has awakened, it is  natural that sexual relations should often ensue. Since in the country  (in contrast with large towns, in which prostitution is commonly  rampant) premarital sexual intercourse is comparatively frequent, we can  readily understand that such a relationship as has been described will  often culminate in marriage, for in the country marriage is far less  often prevented by the occurrence of pre-marital intercourse than it is  in large towns.    On the whole, however, the amatory manifestations of childhood are of  brief duration. Separation at first gives rise to spiritual pain, but  this is as a rule soon forgotten; similarly when the beloved one is  snatched away by death, the child's grief is not enduring. Commonly such  painful emotions speedily pass away; and whether the parting is due to  death or to other causes, a new passion is apt shortly to replace the  old. In exceptional cases, however, the death of the beloved one, or  separation otherwise effected, may, even in the child lead to suicide or  to severe nervous disturbances.    Hitherto I have spoken of the processes of detumescence and  contrectation as isolated manifestations. As regards the relationships  between these respective processes, there are various possibilities. In  the first place, one may exist when the other is absent, that is to say,  the phenomena of detumescence or the phenomena of contrectation may  appear in isolation. Secondly, the two processes may be in complete  association each with the other. A boy of thirteen years feels the  impulse to draw near to a girl, and to kiss her; when this close contact  takes place, erection ensues. Of all the cases known to me, the earliest  age at which such a phenomenon occurred is given in a case published by  Fere.[37]    Two cousins, boy and girl, were playmates from the time they were both  about three years old. They played at being man and wife; and when they  were not actually together, the boy's imagination was occupied with the  subject. He thought continually about it, and when he was in bed at  night erection occurred, accompanied by an agreeable sensation. He went  to sleep, and dreamed that other persons got into bed with him and  touched him. Among these persons was the little girl, his cousin. Such  dreams recurred very frequently; the girl, moreover, was constantly in  his waking thoughts. As he grew older, his fondness persisted; but when  at the age of seventeen he made up his mind to tell his cousin of his  love for her, she became engaged to someone else. Consequently he  suffered from severe nervous shock.    In the third place, the two processes, contrectation and detumescence,  may occur simultaneously, without the detumescence being associated with  the object of the contrectation impulse. Thus cases occur in which boys  experience organic sensations in the genital organs leading them to  masturbate, and at the same time love someone; and yet when in the  company of, and even when embracing the beloved, such a boy will not  experience any specific sensations in the genital organs, nor will any  impulse arise towards sexual contact with the beloved person.    When the two processes are associated in such a manner that proximity  to the object of the contrectation impulse arouses the phenomena of  detumescence, sexual acts between the two persons are very likely to  result--provided, of course, that the affection is reciprocal. In this  way many of the sexual acts effected between children originate; and the  same is true of those in which children at times very readily lend  themselves to the gratification of the sexual passion of adults. We  learn from experience that in such cases attempts at actual intercourse  may be made by children, usually accompanied by erection, but in most  cases without ejaculation. I append a brief report of one case which  came under my own observation.    CASE 4.--X., twenty-one years of age, apparently sprung from a healthy  family, and at least free from hereditary taint, declares that his first  experience of sexual sensations occurred at the early age of five or six  years; at this age he became enamoured of a servant girl, who caressed  him very frequently, and pressed her genital organs against his body.  Later, when eight or nine years old, he fell in love with a girl of  about the same age, and made attempts at coitus. He remembers quite  distinctly that he then had erections, and also a kind of voluptuous  sensation, but no ejaculation. After continuing this practice for a  considerable time, he became aware, being very religiously brought up,  that he was behaving very wrongly. He therefore gave up all attempts at  sexual congress, and lived quite chastely until he attained the age of  nineteen. Throughout this time he neither masturbated, nor endeavoured  to effect coitus, nor practised any kind of sexual act. At the age of  nineteen, however, the sexual impulse becoming very powerful, he began  to masturbate, and has continued to do so up to the present time---  once, twice, thrice, or even four times weekly. Once he did not  masturbate for as long as three months, but this was the only prolonged  continent interval. He experiences a normal impulse towards members of  the other sex. Prostitutes are repulsive to him; he is attracted chiefly  by girls of exceptional intelligence. He feels quite certain that to  kiss and embrace such a girl would be very pleasurable to him, although  he is not aware of any definite impulse towards coitus. Masturbation  has always been practised by him as a purely physical act,  unaccompanied, that is to say, by any imaginative ideas.    In most cases, the complete association of the processes of detumescence  and contrectation, such as occurs in the impulse towards coitus, first  takes place at a somewhat later age. This is so even when the sensory  element, which constitutes a part also of the contrectation impulse, has  been already clearly manifested. The contrectation impulse does not  consist solely in this, that the boy experiences a purely spiritual love  for the girl; it may rather happen that certain definite sexual bodily  peculiarities in a woman attract him. When such a boy one day  unexpectedly sees a girl's breasts,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28434"],[0,"The Astronomy of Milton's 'Paradise Lost' (#20)"],[1,"of philosophy at Padua, when requested to look  at the Moon and planets through Galileo's glass, persistently declined,  and did his utmost to persuade the Grand Duke that the four satellites  of Jupiter could not possibly exist. Francesco Sizzi, a Florentine  astronomer, argued that, as there are seven apertures in the head,  seven known metals, and seven days in the week, so there could only be  seven planets. To these absurd remarks Galileo replied by saying that,  'whatever their force might be as a reason for believing beforehand that  no more than seven planets would be discovered, they hardly seemed of  sufficient weight to destroy the new ones when actually seen.' Another  individual, named Christmann, writes: 'We are not to think that Jupiter  has four satellites given him by Nature in order, by revolving round  him, to immortalize the name of the Medici, who first had notice of the  observation. These are the dreams of idle men, who love ludicrous ideas  better than our laborious and industrious correction of the heavens.  Nature abhors so horrible a chaos, and to the truly wise such vanity is  detestable.' Martin Horky, a _protege_ of Kepler's, issued a pamphlet in  which he made a violent attack on Galileo. He says: 'I will never  concede his four new planets to that Italian from Padua though I die for  it.' He then asks the following questions, and replies to them himself:  (1) Whether they exist? (2) What they are? (3) What they are like? (4)  Why they are? 'The first question is soon disposed of by Horky's  declaring positively that he has examined the heavens with Galileo's own  glass, and that no such thing as a satellite about Jupiter exists. To  the second, he declared solemnly that he does not more surely know that  he has a soul in his body than that reflected rays are the sole cause of  Galileo's erroneous observations. In regard to the third question, he  says that these planets are like the smallest fly compared to an  elephant; and, finally, concludes on the fourth, that the only use of  them is to gratify Galileo's \"thirst of gold,\" and to afford himself a  subject of discussion.'[7] Galileo did not condescend to take any notice  of this scurrilous production; but Horky, who imagined that he had done  something clever, sent a copy of his pamphlet to Kepler. In a few days  after he called to see him, and was received with such a storm of  indignation that he begged for mercy and implored his forgiveness.  Kepler forgave him, but insisted on his making amends. He writes: 'I  have taken him again into favour upon this preliminary condition, to  which he has agreed--that I am to show him Jupiter's satellites, _and he  is to see them_, and own that they are there.'    The evidence in support of the existence of Jupiter's satellites became  so conclusive that the opponents of Galileo were compelled to renounce  their disbelief in those bodies, whether real or pretended. The Grand  Duke, preferring to trust to his eyes rather than believe in the  arguments of the professor at Padua, observed the satellites on several  occasions, along with Galileo, at Pisa, and on his departure bestowed  upon him a gift of one thousand florins. Several of Galileo's enemies,  as a result of their observations, now arrived at the conclusion that  his discovery was incomplete, and that Jupiter had more than four  satellites in attendance upon him. Scheiner counted five, Rheita nine,  and other observers increased the number to twelve. But it was found to  be quite as hazardous to exceed the number stated by Galileo as it was  to deny the existence of any; for, when Jupiter had traversed a short  distance of his path among the fixed stars, the only bodies that  accompanied him were his four original attendants, which continued to  revolve round him with unerring regularity in every part of his orbit.    Galileo did not afford his opponents much time to oppose or controvert  with argument the discoveries made by him with the telescope before his  announcement of a new one attracted public attention from those already  known. He, however, exercised greater caution in disclosing the results  of his observations, as other persons laid claim to having made similar  discoveries prior to the time at which his were announced. He therefore  adopted a method in common use among astronomers in those days, by which  the letters in a sentence announcing a discovery were transposed so as  to form an anagram.    Galileo announced his next discovery in this manner, and which read as  follows:--        Smaismrmilme poeta leumi bvne nugttaviras.    This, when deciphered, formed the sentence:--        Altissimum planetam tergeminum observavi.        I have observed that the remotest planet is triple.    Galileo perceived that Saturn presented a triform appearance, and that,  instead of one body, there were three, all in a straight line, and  apparently in contact with each other, the middle one being larger than  the two lateral ones. In a letter to Kepler he remarked: 'Now I have  discovered a Court for Jupiter, and two servants for this old man, who  aid his steps and never quit his side.' Kepler, who excelled as an  imaginative writer, replied: 'I will not make an old man of Saturn, nor  slaves of his attendant globes; but rather let this tricorporate form be  Geryon--so shall Galileo be Hercules, and the telescope his club, armed  with which he has conquered that distant planet, and dragged him from  the remotest depths of Nature, and exposed him to the view of all.'  Continuing his observations, Galileo perceived that the two lateral  objects gradually decreased in size, and at the expiration of two years  entirely disappeared, leaving the central globe visible only. He was  unable to assign any reason for this peculiar occurrence, which caused  him much perplexity, and he expresses himself thus: 'What is to be said  concerning so strange a metamorphosis? Are the two lesser stars consumed  after the manner of the solar spots? Have they vanished and suddenly  fled? Has Saturn, perhaps, devoured his own children? Or were the  appearances, indeed, illusion or fraud, with which the glasses have so  long deceived me, as well as many others to whom I have shown them? Now,  perhaps, is the time to revive the well-nigh withered hopes of those  who, guided by more profound contemplations, have discovered the fallacy  of the new observations, and demonstrated the utter impossibility of  their existence. I do not know what to say in a case so surprising, so  unlooked-for, and so novel. The shortness of the time, the unexpected  nature of the event, the weakness of my understanding, and the fear of  being mistaken, have greatly confounded me.' After a certain interval  those bodies reappeared; but Galileo's glass was not sufficiently  powerful to enable him to ascertain their nature nor solve the mystery,  which for upwards of half a century perplexed the ablest astronomers.    The elucidation of this inexplicable phenomenon was reserved for  Christian Huygens, who, with an improved telescope of his own  construction, was able to declare that Saturn's appendages were portions  of a ring which surrounds the planet, and is everywhere distinct from  its surface.    Galileo next directed his attention to the planet Venus, and as a result  of his observations was led to communicate to the public another  anagram:--        Haec immatura a me jam frustra leguntur oy.    This, when rendered correctly, reads:--        Cynthiae figuras aemulatur mater amorum.        Venus rivals the appearances of the Moon.    The phases of Venus were one of the most interesting of Galileo's  discoveries with the telescope. When observed near inferior conjunction  the planet presents the appearance of a slender crescent, resembling  the Moon when a few days old. Travelling from this point to superior  conjunction, the illumined portion of her disc gradually increases,  until it becomes circular, like the full Moon. This changing appearance  of Venus afforded Galileo irresistible proof that the planet is an  opaque body, which derives its light from the Sun, and that it circles  round the orb--convincing evidence of the accuracy and truthfulness of  the Copernican theory.    It was in this manner that Galileo announced his discovery of the phases  of Venus, the peerless planet of our morning and evening skies, whose  slender crescent forms such a beautiful object in the telescope, and  who, as she traverses her orbit, exhibits all the varied changes of form  presented by the Moon in her monthly journey round the Earth. These  varying aspects of Venus were not unknown to Milton; and, indeed, he may  have been informed of them by Galileo in his conversation with him at  Arcetri; nor has he failed to introduce an allusion to this beautiful  phenomenon in his poem. In his description of the Creation, after the  Sun was formed, he adds:--        Hither, as to their fountain, other stars      Repairing, in their golden urns draw light,      And hence the morning planet gilds her horns.--vii. 364-66.    Galileo also discovered that the planet Mars does not always present the  appearance of a circular disc. When near opposition the full disc of the  planet is visible, but at all other times it is gibbous, and approaches  nearest to that of a half-moon when at the quadratures.    In the year 1610, on directing his telescope to the Sun, Galileo  detected dark spots on the solar disc. Similar spots, sufficiently large  to be distinguished by the naked eye, had been observed from time to  time for centuries prior to the invention of the telescope, but nothing  was known of their nature. In 1609 Kepler observed a spot on the Sun,  which he thought was the planet Mercury in conjunction with the orb; the  short time during which it was visible, in consequence of clouds having  obscured the face of the luminary, prevented him from being able to  determine the accuracy"]]]
