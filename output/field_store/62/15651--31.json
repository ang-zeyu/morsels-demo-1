The depths of the  house, in which the forms of male and female slaves were moving, gleamed  also with light. In the triclinium a table was laid for four persons.  At the feast were to sit, besides Vinicius and Lygia, Petronius  and Chrysothemis. Vinicius had followed in everything the words of  Petronius, who advised him not to go for Lygia, but to send Atacinus  with the permission obtained from Caesar, to receive her himself in the  house, receive her with friendliness and even with marks of honor.    \"Thou wert drunk yesterday,\" said he; \"I saw thee. Thou didst act with  her like a quarryman from the Alban Hills. Be not over-insistent, and  remember that one should drink good wine slowly. Know too that it is  sweet to desire, but sweeter to be desired.\"    Chrysothemis had her own and a somewhat different opinion on this point;  but Petronius, calling her his vestal and his dove, began to explain the  difference which must exist between a trained charioteer of the Circus  and the youth who sits on the quadriga for the first time. Then, turning  to Vinicius, he continued,--\"Win her confidence, make her joyful, be  magnanimous. I have no wish to see a gloomy feast. Swear to her, by  Hades even, that thou wilt return her to Pomponia, and it will be thy  affair that to-morrow she prefers to stay with thee.\"    Then pointing to Chrysothemis, he added,--\"For five years I have acted  thus more or less with this timid dove, and I cannot complain of her  harshness.\"    Chrysothemis struck him with her fan of peacock feathers, and  said,--\"But I did not resist, thou satyr!\"    \"Out of consideration for my predecessor--\"    \"But wert thou not at my feet?\"    \"Yes; to put rings on thy toes.\"    Chrysothemis looked involuntarily at her feet, on the toes of which  diamonds were really glittering; and she and Petronius began to laugh.  But Vinicius did not give ear to their bantering. His heart was beating  unquietly under the robes of a Syrian priest, in which he had arrayed  himself to receive Lygia.    \"They must have left the palace,\" said he, as if in a monologue.    \"They must,\" answered Petronius. \"Meanwhile I may mention the  predictions of Apollonius of Tyana, or that history of Rufinus which I  have not finished, I do not remember why.\"    But Vinicius cared no more for Apollonius of Tyana than for the history  of Rufinus. His mind was with Lygia; and though he felt that it was more  appropriate to receive her at home than to go in the role of a myrmidon  to the palace, he was sorry at moments that he had not gone, for the  single reason that he might have seen her sooner, and sat near her in  the dark, in the double litter.    Meanwhile slaves brought in a tripod ornamented with rams' heads, bronze  dishes with coals, on which they sprinkled bits of myrrh and nard.    \"Now they are turning toward the Carinae,\" said Vinicius, again.    \"He cannot wait; he will run to meet the litter, and is likely to miss  them!\" exclaimed Chrysothemis.    Vinicius smiled without thinking, and said,--\"On the contrary, I will  wait.\"    But he distended his nostrils and panted; seeing which, Petronius  shrugged his shoulders, and said,--\"There is not in him a philosopher to  the value of one sestertium, and I shall never make a man of that son of  Mars.\"    \"They are now in the Carinae.\"    In fact, they were turning toward the Carinae. The slaves called  lampadarii were in front; others called pedisequii, were on both sides  of the litter. Atacinus was right behind, overseeing the advance. But  they moved slowly, for lamps showed the way badly in a place not lighted  at all. The streets near the palace were empty; here and there only  some man moved forward with a lantern, but farther on the place was  uncommonly crowded. From almost every alley people were pushing out in  threes and fours, all without lamps, all in dark mantles. Some walked on  with the procession, mingling with the slaves; others in greater numbers  came from the opposite direction. Some staggered as if drunk. At moments  the advance grew so difficult that the lampadarii cried,--\"Give way to  the noble tribune, Marcus Vinicius!\"    Lygia saw those dark crowds through the curtains which were pushed  aside, and trembled with emotion. She was carried away at one moment by  hope, at another by fear.    \"That is he!--that is Ursus and the Christians! Now it will happen  quickly,\" said she, with trembling lips. \"O Christ, aid! O Christ,  save!\"    Atacinus himself, who at first did not notice the uncommon animation of  the street, began at last to be alarmed. There was something strange in  this. The lampadarii had to cry oftener and oftener, \"Give way to the  litter of the noble tribune!\" From the sides unknown people crowded up  to the litter so much that Atacinus commanded the slaves to repulse them  with clubs.    Suddenly a cry was heard in front of the procession. In one instant all  the lights were extinguished. Around the litter came a rush, an uproar,  a struggle.    Atacinus saw that this was simply an attack; and when he saw it he was  frightened. It was known to all that Caesar with a crowd of attendants  made attacks frequently for amusement in the Subura and in other parts  of the city. It was known that even at times he brought out of these  night adventures black and blue spots; but whoso defended himself went  to his death, even if a senator. The house of the guards, whose duty it  was to watch over the city, was not very far; but during such attacks  the guards feigned to be deaf and blind.    Meanwhile there was an uproar around the litter; people struck,  struggled, threw, and trampled one another. The thought flashed on  Atacinus to save Lygia and himself, above all, and leave the rest to  their fate. So, drawing her out of the litter, he took her in his arms  and strove to escape in the darkness.    But Lygia called, \"Ursus! Ursus!\"    She was dressed in white; hence it was easy to see her. Atacinus, with  his other arm, which was free, was throwing his own mantle over  her hastily, when terrible claws seized his neck, and on his head a  gigantic, crushing mass fell like a stone.    He dropped in one instant, as an ox felled by the back of an axe before  the altar of Jove.    The slaves for the greater part were either lying on the ground, or had  saved themselves by scattering in the thick darkness, around the turns  of the walls. On the spot remained only the litter, broken in the  onset. Ursus bore away Lygia to the Subura; his comrades followed him,  dispersing gradually along the way.    The slaves assembled before the house of Vinicius, and took counsel.  They had not courage to enter. After a short deliberation they returned  to the place of conflict, where they found a few corpses, and among  them Atacinus. He was quivering yet; but, after a moment of more violent  convulsion, he stretched and was motionless.    They took him then, and, returning, stopped before the gate a second  time. But they must declare to their lord what had happened.    \"Let Gulo declare it,\" whispered some voices; \"blood is flowing from his  face as from ours; and the master loves him; it is safer for Gulo than  for others.\"    Gulo, a German, an old slave, who had nursed Vinicius, and was inherited  by him from his mother, the sister of Petronius, said,--    \"I will tell him; but do ye all come. Do not let his anger fall on my  head alone.\"    Vinicius was growing thoroughly impatient. Petronius and Chrysothemis  were laughing; but he walked with quick step up and down the atrium.    \"They ought to be here! They ought to be here!\"    He wished to go out to meet the litter, but Petronius and Chrysothemis  detained him.    Steps were heard suddenly in the entrance; the slaves rushed into the  atrium in a crowd, and, halting quickly at the wall, raised their hands,  and began to repeat with groaning,--\"Aaaa!--aa!\"    Vinicius sprang toward them.    \"Where is Lygia?\" cried he, with a terrible and changed voice.    \"Aaaa!\"    Then Gulo pushed forward with his bloody face, and exclaimed, in haste  and pitifully,--    \"See our blood, lord! We fought! See our blood! See our blood!\"    But he had not finished when Vinicius seized a bronze lamp, and with one  blow shattered the skull of the slave; then, seizing his own head with  both hands, he drove his fingers into his hair, repeating hoarsely,--\"Me  miserum! me miserum!\"    His face became blue, his eyes turned in his head, foam came out on his  lips.    \"Whips!\" roared he at last, with an unearthly voice.    \"Lord! Aaaa! Take pity!\" groaned the slaves.    Petronius stood up with an expression of disgust on his face. \"Come,  Chrysothemis!\" said he. \"If 'tis thy wish to look on raw flesh, I will  give command to open a butcher's stall on the Carinae!\"    And he walked out of the atrium. But through the whole house, ornamented  in the green of ivy and prepared for a feast, were heard, from moment  to moment, groans and the whistling of whips, which lasted almost till  morning.          Chapter XI      VINICIUS did not lie down that night. Some time after the departure of  Petronius, when the groans of his flogged slaves could allay neither his  rage nor his pain, he collected a crowd of other servants, and, though  the night was far advanced, rushed forth at the head of these to look  for Lygia. He visited the district of the Esquiline, then the Subura,  Vicus Sceleratus, and all the adjoining alleys. Passing next around the  Capitol, he went to the island over the bridge of Fabricius; after that  he passed through a part of the Trans-Tiber. But that was a pursuit  without object, for he himself had no hope of finding Lygia, and if he  sought her it was mainly to fill out with something a terrible night.  In fact he returned home about daybreak, when the carts and mules of  dealers in vegetables began to appear in the city, and when bakers were  opening their shops."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28536"],[0,"The Astronomy of the Bible (#20)"],[1,"a lunation. Now 242  Draconic periods very nearly equal 223 lunations, being about 18 years  10-1/3 days, and both are very nearly equal to 19 returns of the sun to  the moon's node; so that if the moon is new or full when at a node, in  18 years and 10 or 11 days it will be at that node again, and again new  or full, and the sun will be also present in very nearly its former  position. If, therefore, an eclipse occurred on the former occasion, it  will probably occur on the latter. This recurrence of eclipses after  intervals of 18.03 years is called the Saros, and was known to the  Chaldeans. We do not know whether it was known to the Hebrews prior to  their captivity in Babylon, but possibly the statement of the wise king,  already quoted from the Apocryphal \"Wisdom of Solomon,\" may refer to  some such knowledge.    Our calendar to-day is a purely solar one; our months are twelve in  number, but of purely arbitrary length, divorced from all connection  with the moon; and to us, the Saros cycle does not readily leap to the  eye, for eclipses of sun or moon seem to fall haphazard on any day of  the month or year.    But with the Hebrews, Assyrians, and Babylonians it was not so. Their  calendar was a luni-solar one--their year was on the average a solar  year, their months were true lunations; the first day of their new month  began on the evening when the first thin crescent of the moon appeared  after its conjunction with the sun. This observation is what is meant in  the Bible by the \"new moon.\" Astronomers now by \"new moon\" mean the time  when it is actually in conjunction with the sun, and is therefore not  visible. Nations whose calendar was of this description were certain to  discover the Saros much sooner than those whose months were not true  lunations, like the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans.    There are no direct references to eclipses in Scripture. They might have  been used in the historical portions for the purpose of dating events,  as was the great earthquake in the days of King Uzziah, but they were  not so used. But we find not a few allusions to their characteristic  appearances and phenomena in the books of the prophets. God in the  beginning set the two great lights in the firmament for signs as well as  for seasons; and the prophets throughout use the relations of the sun  and moon as types of spiritual relations. The Messiah was the Sun of  Righteousness; the chosen people, the Church, was as the moon, which  derives her light from Him. The \"signs of heaven\" were _symbols_ of  great spiritual events, not _omens_ of mundane disasters.    The prophets Joel and Amos are clear and vivid in their descriptions;  probably because the eclipse of 831 B.C. was within their recollection.  Joel says first, \"The sun and the moon shall be dark;\" and again, more  plainly,--         \"I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood,       and fire, and pillars of smoke. The sun shall be turned into       darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and the       terrible day of the Lord come.\"    This prophecy was quoted by St. Peter on the day of Pentecost. And in  the Apocalypse, St. John says that when the sixth seal was opened, \"the  sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood.\"    In these references, the two kinds of eclipses are referred to--the sun  becomes black when the moon is \"new\" and hides it; the moon becomes as  blood when it is \"full\" and the earth's shadow falls upon it; its deep  copper colour, like that of dried blood, being due to the fact that the  light, falling upon it, has passed through a great depth of the earth's  atmosphere. These two eclipses cannot therefore be coincident, but they  may occur only a fortnight apart--a total eclipse of the sun may be  accompanied by a partial eclipse of the moon, a fortnight earlier or a  fortnight later; a total eclipse of the moon may be accompanied by  partial eclipses of the sun, both at the preceding and following \"new  moons.\"    Writing at about the same period, the prophet Amos says--         \"Saith the Lord God, I will cause the sun to go down at noon,       and I will darken the earth in the clear day,\"    and seems to refer to the fact that the eclipse of 831 B.C. occurred  about midday in Judaea.    Later Micah writes--         \"The sun shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall be       dark over them.\"    Isaiah says that the \"sun shall be darkened in his going forth,\" and  Jeremiah that \"her sun is gone down while it was yet day.\" Whilst  Ezekiel says--         \"I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not       give her light. All the bright lights of heaven will I make       dark over thee, and set darkness upon thy land, saith the Lord       God.\"    But a total eclipse is not all darkness and terror; it has a beauty and  a glory all its own. Scarcely has the dark moon hidden the last thread  of sunlight from view, than spurs of rosy light are seen around the  black disc that now fills the place so lately occupied by the glorious  king of day. And these rosy spurs of light shine on a background of  pearly glory, as impressive in its beauty as the swift march of the  awful shadow, and the seeming descent of the darkened heavens, were in  terror. There it shines, pure, lovely, serene, radiant with a light like  molten silver, wreathing the darkened sun with a halo like that round a  saintly head in some noble altar-piece; so that while in some cases the  dreadful shadow has awed a laughing and frivolous crowd into silence, in  others the radiance of that halo has brought spectators to their knees  with an involuntary exclamation, \"The Glory!\" as if God Himself had made  known His presence in the moment of the sun's eclipse.    And this, indeed, seems to have been the thought of both the  Babylonians and Egyptians of old. Both nations had a specially sacred  symbol to set forth the Divine Presence--the Egyptians, a disc with long  outstretched wings; the Babylonians, a ring with wings. The latter  symbol on Assyrian monuments is always shown as floating over the head  of the king, and is designed to indicate the presence and protection of  the Deity.    [Illustration: THE ASSYRIAN \"RING WITH WINGS.\"]    We may take it for granted that the Egyptians and Chaldeans of old, as  modern astronomers to-day, had at one time or another presented to them  every type of coronal form. But there would, no doubt, be a difficulty  in grasping or remembering the irregular details of the corona as seen  in most eclipses. Sometimes, however, the corona shows itself in a  striking and simple form--when sun-spots are few in number, it spreads  itself out in two great equatorial streamers. At the eclipse of Algiers  in 1900, already referred to, one observer who watched the eclipse from  the sea, said--         \"The sky was blue all round the sun, and the effect of the       silvery corona projected on it was beyond any one to describe.       I can only say it seemed to me what angels' wings will be       like.\"[129:1]    [Illustration: CORONA OF MINIMUM TYPE.    Drawing made by W. H. Wesley, from photographs of the 1900 Eclipse.]    It seems exceedingly probable that the symbol of the ring with wings  owed its origin not to any supposed analogy between the ring and the  wings and the divine attributes of eternity and power, but to the  revelations of a total eclipse with a corona of minimum type. Moreover  the Assyrians, when they insert a figure of their deity within the ring,  give him a kilt-like dress, and this kilted or feathered characteristic  is often retained where the figure is omitted. This gives the symbol a  yet closer likeness to the corona, whose \"polar rays\" are remarkably  like the tail feathers of a bird.    Perhaps the prophet Malachi makes a reference to this characteristic of  the eclipsed sun, with its corona like \"angels' wings,\" when he  predicts--         \"But unto you that fear My name shall the Sun of Righteousness       arise with healing in His wings.\"    But, if this be so, it must be borne in mind that the prophet uses the  corona as a simile only. No more than the sun itself, is it the Deity,  or the manifestation of the Deity.    In the New Testament we may find perhaps a reference to what causes an  eclipse--to the shadow cast by a heavenly body in its revolution--its  \"turning.\"         \"Every good gift and every perfect boon is from above, coming       down from the Father of Lights, with Whom can be no variation,       neither shadow that is cast by turning.\"      FOOTNOTES:    [129:1] _The Total Solar Eclipse of May, 1900_, p. 22.          CHAPTER XII    SATURN AND ASTROLOGY      The planets, as such, are nowhere mentioned in the Bible. In the one  instance in which the word appears in our versions, it is given as a  translation of _Mazzaloth_, better rendered in the margin as the \"twelve  signs or constellations.\" The evidence is not fully conclusive that  allusion is made to any planet, even in its capacity of a god worshipped  by the surrounding nations.    Of planets, besides the earth, modern astronomy knows Mercury, Venus,  Mars, many planetoids, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. And of  satellites revolving round planets there are at present known, the moon  which owns our earth as primary, two satellites to Mars, seven  satellites to Jupiter, ten to Saturn, four to Uranus, and one to  Neptune.    The ancients counted the planets as seven, numbering the moon and the  sun amongst them. The rest were Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and  Saturn. They recognized no satellites to any planet. We have no evidence  that the ancient Semitic nations considered that the moon was more  intimately connected with the earth than any of the other six.    But though the planets were sometimes regarded as \"seven\" in number,  the ancients perfectly recognized that the sun and moon stood in a  different category altogether from the other five. And "]]]
