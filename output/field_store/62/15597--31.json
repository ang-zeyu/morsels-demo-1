He had much credit with the king, and this (would you believe  it?) resulted from his reputation as a man of intrigue. He told the  king every thing that came into his head: he told him one day, that the  Choiseuls boasted that he, the king of France, never dared introduce his  mistress into the state apartments at Versailles.    \"Yes,\" added the duke, \"they boast so loudly, that nothing else is  talked of in the province; and at Bordeaux, for instance, there is one  merchant who, on the strength of the enemies of the comtesse, has made a  bet that she will never be presented.\"    \"And why do you not imprison these persons?\" inquired the king, angrily.    \"Because, sire, it appears to me injustice to punish the echo of the  fooleries of Paris.\"    \"I will conduct myself as regards the presentation of madame du Barry  in the manner which I think best. But is it not an inconceivable  contrariety, that one party should wish it with the utmost desire,  and another place every obstacle in the way? In truth, I am very  unfortunate, and a cruel tyranny is exercised over me.\"    The duc de Richelieu, not wishing to appear as one of the tyrants of the  king, gave a different turn to the conversation.    My presentation was, however, a matter of first-rate importance to me  and to my partizans, and the duc de la Vrilliere was gained over to my  side, by making him believe that the king would yield to my desires, and  that then I should remember all those who opposed my elevation. The duc  d'Aiguillon also drew over to my party M. Bertin, who bore no love to  the Choiseuls, and who saw that the preponderance of interest was on  my side of the scale. When I was assured of a considerable number of  defenders, I thought I might venture on the master stroke, and thus I  went to work.    One evening the king was with me, and the MM. de Maupeou and de  Richelieu were there also. We were discoursing of different things, and  the king was perfectly tranquillized, little anticipating the scene that  was in store for him. I rose suddenly from my arm-chair, and going up to  his majesty, after a profound courtesy cast myself at his feet. Louis XV  would have raised me, but I said,    \"No, I will remain where I am until you have accorded me the favor I  ask.\"    \"If you remain in this posture I shall place myself in a similar one.\"    \"Well, then, since you will not have me at your knees I will place  myself on them\"; and I seated myself in his lap without ceremony.    \"Listen to me, sire,\" I said, \"and repeat what I say to the king of  France word for word. He must authorize my presentation; for else, some  fine day, in the presence of the whole court, I will go to the state  apartments, and try whether I shall be repulsed at the door.\"    \"Will she have the boldness?\" inquired the king to the chancellor.    \"I have no doubt of it, sire. A female, young, beautiful, honored with  your kindness, may venture to do anything.\"    \"Is it not distressing to me,\" I added, \"that, graced with your  majesty's favors, I remain thus concealed, whilst women whom you detest  annoy you with their presence.\"    \"Madame is right,\" replied the duc de Richelieu, \"and I see that you  look for her every evening where she is not, and where she ought to be.\"    \"What! you too, duc de Richelieu, do you join the cry of the  chancellor?\"    \"I would tear out the eyes of these gentlemen,\" I added, \"if they  thought differently from me.\"    \"Oh,\" said the king, laughing, \"this punishment would not be one for M.  Maupeou: justice ought to be blind: and as for you, M. de Richelieu, you  have your _baton_ left.\"    \"Which he has nobly gained,\" I replied, \"by fighting against your  majesty's enemies, and of which he still continues worthy, by now  defending me from my foes.\"    \"This rebellion,\" said the king, \"cannot last, and I see myself  compelled to hold a _lit de justice_ (a judicial sitting or bed).\"    \"And I swear to you, that I will receive nobody into mine until I have  been presented.\"    This sally amused the king, who said, \"Well, since it must be so, you  shall be presented.\"    At this I leaped on the king's neck, giving a cry which might have been  heard by my rivals. After that, I advanced to the two gentlemen who had  advocated my cause so well, extending a hand to each, which they took  and kissed with great gallantry.    Louis XV became thoughtful, and continued to mutter between his teeth,  \"I wash my hands of it--they will cry out, they will clamor, but it must  be so.\" I saw the feelings of the king, and took care not to allow him  to go away in this state. Whilst I sought to compose him by my caresses,  the duc de Richelieu told us one of his thousand and one adventures,  which he told so well. I know not if it will please you, but such as it  is I shall give you an abridgment of it.    \"I was, you know,\" he began, \"a very good-looking, a very wild fellow:  women have no objection to this. I was travelling, and in my way thro'  D----, M., the intendant of the city, insisted on my taking up my abode  at his house. His lady added her entreaties, and I consented. I must  tell you that the lady was handsome. I had passed the night with her;  but when, on the next morning, as I sought to go out of her apartment, I  found the outer door double locked and bolted. I looked round me on all  sides, but found no egress. Whilst I was lamenting this with the lady's  _femme-de-chambre_, who was nearly as much distressed as her mistress,  I saw in a detached closet a great many machines covered with paper, and  all of different shapes. On inquiry, I was informed that the following  Monday was the lady's birthday, which they were to celebrate with  fireworks. I looked at the beautiful fusees and brilliant suns with  much admiration. Suddenly, thinking of the lady's honor which might be  compromised, I took a light and set fire to a Roman candle; in a  moment the whole was in flames, and everybody took alarm. Great was the  consternation in the house, which was turned out of windows; and in the  uproar, the house-door being broken open, a crowd of persons rushed in;  I ran this way and that way; everybody admired and praised my exertions.  I was compelled to quit the house at last, and ordered my carriage,  whilst M. the intendant was thanking me for the vast service I had  rendered him. I assure you, sire, that I never laughed more heartily.\"*         * The duc de Richelieu preserved his coolness and talent at       repartee in the most trivial circumstances. The story is       well known of the man who came to ask for his aid, saying       they were related.  \"How?\" asked the duke.  \"Sir, by Adam.\"       \"Give this man a penny,\" said the duke, turning to a       gentleman of his train; \"and if all of his relations give       him as much he will soon be a richer man than I am.\"         If our readers will turn to \"Joe Miller,\" Page 45, they will       find this jest attributed to the witty duke of Buckingham.       It is a very good joke for a duke, but savors more of a       desire to be witty than to be charitable. (translator)    This tale amused the king, and M. de Richelieu assured him that he had  never told it before. A thousand considerations had induced him to keep  it to himself until the present time. \"But now,\" said he, \"the third  generation of madame l'intendante is no longer young, and I have no fear  of being called out to fight a duel.\"    Next day there was a general rumor of my presentation. My friends  asserted that I had the king's promise. This was imprudent on their  part, and they injured my interest whilst they flattered my vanity. They  put the Choiseul cabal to work, who intrigued so well that not a person  could be found who would perform the office of introductress. You  know the custom: the presentation is effected by the intermediation of  another lady, who conducts the person to be presented to the princesses,  and introduces her. This custom had passed into a law, and it would have  been too humiliating to me to have dispensed with it.    This was a dire blow for me: it distressed me sadly, and I wept over it  with my friends. The duc de Richelieu said to me,    \"With money and promises everything can be managed at court. There is no  place where they know better how to value complaisance, and the price at  which it is sold. Do not give yourself any uneasiness; we shall find the  lady we want.\"    And we did find her, but her compliance was dearly bought. Two ladies  who were applied to stipulated for most outrageous conditions. One, the  marquise de Castellane, consented to present me, but demanded that she  should be created a duchess, and have a gift of five hundred thousand  livres: the other, whose name I forget, asked for her husband the order  of the Holy Ghost and a government, a regiment for her son, and for  herself I forget what. These ladies seemed to think, like Don Quixote  and Sancho Panza, that governments and five hundred thousand livres  were to be picked up on the highway. In truth, they spoke out without  disguise.    At this juncture the chancellor had a singular conversation concerning  me with the Choiseuls. He had been one morning to call on the duke, and  whilst they were discoursing, the duchesse de Grammont came into her  brother's apartment, and entered at once into conversation.    \"Ah, my lord, I am glad to see you. Your new friends carry you off from  your old ones. You are wrong to adore the rising sun.\"    \"That was the idolatry of a great number of persons: but I beg of you to  be so very kind as not to speak to me in figures, if you would wish me  to understand you.\"    \"Oh, you play off the ignorant. You know as well as I do what I mean,  and your daily visits to this _fille_.\"    \"Which, madame? There are so many at court!\"    This sarcastic reply made the brother and sister smile; both of them  being fully competent"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25718"],[0,"The Watchers of the Trails: A Book of Animal Life (#20)"],[1,"he felt sure that the bear was also waiting and listening, in  an uncertainty not much unlike his own. He decided that it was for him  to take the initiative. Clapping his hands smartly, he threw back his  head, and burst into a peal of laughter.    The loud, incongruous sound shocked the silences. It almost horrified  the man himself, so unexpected, so unnatural, so inexplicable did it  seem even to his own ears. When it ceased, he knew that it had  accomplished its purpose. He heard rustling and snapping noises  swiftly diminishing in the distance, and knew that the bear was  retreating in a panic. At this he laughed again, not loudly, but to  himself, and stepped out into the trail.    But the man was not yet done with the effects of his loud challenge to  the solemnities of the dark. Hardly had he taken three steps along the  trail when a little in front of him--perhaps, as he guessed, some five  and twenty paces--there arose a slashing and crashing noise of  struggle. Branches cracked and rustled and snapped, heavy feet pounded  the earth, and a confusion of gasping grunts suggested a blind  menagerie in mortal combat. The man, fairly startled, groped his way  back to the tree, and waited behind it, knife in hand. In fact he had  a strong inclination to climb into the branches; but this impulse he  angrily restrained.    For a whole minute the daunting uproar continued, neither approaching  nor receding, and at length the man's curiosity, ever insatiable where  the mysteries of the wild were concerned, got the better of his  prudence. He lit a match and peered from behind his shelter. The  little, sudden blaze spread a sharp light, but whatever was making the  uproar went on as before, quite heedless of the singular phenomenon.  When the match died out it left the man no wiser. Then with hurried  hands he stripped some birch bark, and rolled himself a serviceable  torch. When this blazed up with its smoky flame, he held it well off  to one side and a little behind him, and made his way warily to the  scene of the disturbance.    A turn in the trail, and the mystery stood revealed. With a cry of  indignation the man darted forward, no longer cautious. What he saw  before him was a great, gaunt moose-cow reared upon her hind legs,  caught under the jaws by a villainous moose-snare. With her head high  among the branches, she lurched and kicked in a brave struggle for  life, while every effort but drew tighter the murdering noose. A few  feet away stood her lanky calf, trembling, and staring stupidly at the  light.    The man lost not a moment. Dropping his bundle and paddle, but  carefully guarding the torch, he climbed the tree above the victim,  lay out on a branch, reached down, and dexterously severed the noose  with his knife. What matter if, with his haste and her struggles, he  at the same time cut a slash in the beast's stout hide? The  blood-letting was a sorely needed medicine to her choked veins. She  fell in a heap, and for a minute or two lay gasping loudly. Then she  staggered to her feet, and stood swaying, while she nosed the calf  with her long muzzle to assure herself that it had not been hurt in  the cataclysm which had overtaken her.    The man watched her until his torch was almost gone, then climbed down  the tree (which was not a birch) to get himself another. Noticing him  now for the first time, the moose pulled herself together with a  mighty effort, and thrust the calf behind her. Could this be the enemy  who had so nearly vanquished her? For a moment the man thought she was  going to charge upon him, and he held himself in readiness to go up  the tree again. But the poor shaken beast thought better of it. Pain,  rage, fear, amazement, doubt,--all these the man fancied he could see  in her staring, bloodshot eyes. He stood quite still, pitying her, and  cursing the brutal poachers who had set the snare. Then, just before  the torch gave its last flicker, the great animal turned and led her  calf off through the woods, looking back nervously as she went.    When the light was out, and silence had come again upon the forest,  the man resumed his journey. He travelled noisily, whistling and  stamping as he went, as a warning to all wild creatures that a man  was in their woods, and that they must give room to a master. He  carried with him now, besides his blanket and his paddle, a generous  roll of birch bark, with which to illuminate the lumber shanty before  going in. It had occurred to him that possibly some lynx or wildcat  might have taken up its dwelling therein; and if so, he was no longer  in the mood to meet it at close quarters in the dark.          The Kings of the Intervale      Far out over the pale, smooth surface of the river a crow flew,  flapping heavily. From time to time he uttered an angry and frightened  squawk. Over, under, and all around him, now darting at his eyes, now  dropping upon him like a little, arrow-pointed thunderbolt, now  slapping a derisive wing across his formidable beak, flashed a small,  dark bird whose silvery white belly now and then caught the sun.    The crow's accustomed alert self-possession was quite shattered. He  had forgotten his own powers of attack. He seemed to fear for his  eyes,--and among all the wild kindred there is no fear more horrifying  than that. When he ducked, and swerved, and tried to dodge, he did it  awkwardly, as if his presence of mind was all gone.    His assailant, less than a third of his weight, was a king-bird, whose  nest, in the crotch of an elm on the intervale meadow, the crow had  been so ill-advised as to investigate. The crow was comparatively  inexperienced, or he would have known enough to keep away from the  nests of the king-birds. But there it was, in plain sight; and he  loved eggs or tender nestlings. Before he had had time to find out  which it was that the nest contained, both the parent birds had fallen  upon him with a swift ferocity which speedily took away his appetite  for food or fight. Their beaks were sturdy and burning sharp. Their  short, powerful wings gave them a flight so swift and darting that,  for all his superior strength, he felt himself at their mercy. His one  thought was to save his eyes and escape.    Both birds chased him till he was well out over the river. Then the  female returned to her nest, leaving her mate to complete the  intruder's chastisement. Had the crow been an old and cunning bird, he  would have sought the extreme heights of air, where the king-bird is  disinclined to follow; but lacking this crow-wisdom, he kept on at the  level of the tallest tree-tops, and was forced to take his punishment.  He was, in reality, more sore and terrified than actually injured.  That darting, threatening beak of his pursuer never actually struck  his eyes. But for this, it is probable, he had only the indulgence of  the king-bird to thank. When at last the chastiser, tired of his task,  turned and flew back up the river toward the nest in the elm-crotch,  the ruffled crow took refuge out of sight, in the top of the densest  hemlock, where he rolled his eyes and preened his plumage silently for  an hour before daring again the vicissitudes of the wilderness world.    The nest to which the triumphant king-bird hurried back was  audaciously perched in plain view of every prowler. The crotch of the  elm-tree which it occupied was about twelve feet from the ground. The  intervale, or water-meadow, by the side of the river, held but a few  widely scattered trees,--trees of open growth, such as elm,  balsam-poplar, and water-ash. It was free from all underbrush. There  was nothing, therefore, to shield the nest from even the most careless  eyes; and with an insolence of fearlessness matched only by that of  the osprey, it was made the more conspicuous by having great tufts of  white wool from a neighbouring sheep-pasture woven into its bulky,  irregular frame. So irregular and haphazard, indeed, did it appear,  that it might almost have been mistaken for a bunch of rubbish left in  the tree from the time of freshet. But if the two king-birds relied on  this resemblance as a concealment, they presumed as so clever a bird  is not likely to do upon the blindness or stupidity of the wild  kindred. The wild kindred are seldom blind, and very seldom stupid,  because those members of the fellowship who are possessed of such  defects sooner or later go to feed their fellows. Hence it was that  most of the folk of the riverside, furred or feathered, knew well  enough what the big whitish-gray bunch of rubbish in the elm-crotch  was.    There were five eggs at the bottom of the smooth, warm cup, which  formed the heart of the nest. They were a little smaller than a  robin's egg, and of a soft creamy white, blotched irregularly with  dull purplish maroon of varying tone. So jealous of these mottled  marvels were the king-birds that not even the most harmless of  visitors were allowed to look upon them. If so much as a thrush, or a  pewee, or a mild-mannered white throat, presumed to alight on the very  remotest branch of that elm, it was brusquely driven away.    One morning early, the male king-bird was sitting very erect, as was  his custom, on the naked tip of a long, slender, dead branch some ten  feet above the nest The morning chill was yet in the air, so it was a  little early for the flies which formed his food to be stirring. But  he was hungry, and on the alert for the first of them to appear. Only  the tense feathers of his crest, raised to show the flame-orange spot  which was his kingly crown, betrayed his eagerness; for he was a  self-contained bird. The sun was just beginning to show the red  topmost edge of his rim through the jagged line of firs across the  river, and the long, level streaks of aerial rose, creeping under the  branches, filled all the shadowed places of the wilderness with  mysterious light.
