RACE CULTURE    THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE RACE THROUGH MOTHER AND CHILD. By Susanna W.  Dodds, M. D.    A large 12mo. volume bound in extra cloth, price, $1.50      The time has come when parents must consider the responsibilities that  rest upon them in relation to their children and make a study of  Eugenics. This cannot be avoided or shirked and especially should  prospective mothers study the subject in all its bearing, and know what  you should do and what you should not do to insure the best possible for  your unborn child. What conditions will promote the best for health, and  afford the highest degree of intellectual and moral development. What  limit you shall place upon the number of children. Race Suicide is not  so serious a question as Race Culture, which may be easily attained by  giving proper attention to the subject.    The author of \"RACE CULTURE\" has made a most careful study of the whole  subject, starting from the foundation, taking up pre-natal culture in  all its bearings, including the marriage relations and the father's  responsibilities. Considering the health and the well-being of the  prospective mother and her diseases. How childbearing may be made easy,  the first care of and the feeding of the babe, all the diseases of  infancy and childhood and their treatment without the use of drugs.    The avoidable causes of disease in children and adults are fully  considered and a voluminous appendix treats of the use of water,  massage, exercise, food and drinks, and how to prepare them as remedial  agencies.    It is safe to say that no greater or more important work on this subject  has ever been written.    Every woman and especially every prospective mother should read it. Its  cost is as nothing compared to its value. Price, $1.50 by mail.          The Food Value of Meat    Flesh Food Not Essential to Mental or Physical Vigor.    By W. R. C. LATSON, M.

The central pillar of  this chapel, with the curved fluting in the column and the quaintly  grotesque devices of the figures carved on the capital, is well worthy of  close examination. The grate that we see here was erected by the French  Protestants, large numbers of whom fled to England during the persecution  which was instituted against their sect in 1561. They were welcomed by  Queen Elizabeth, and allowed to settle in Canterbury, where the cathedral  crypt was made over to them to use as a weaving factory. It is possible  that the ridges in the floor of St. John's Chapel are marks left by their  looms, but more evident trace of their occupation is afforded by the  inscriptions in French painted on the pillars and arches of the main  crypt, and again by the custom which still survives of holding a French  service in the south aisle of the crypt; this part has been walled off  especially as a place of worship for the descendants of the French exiles,  and here service is still held in the French tongue. Alterations have been  lately made by which the French service is held in the Black Prince's  Chantry, and the part of the crypt formerly walled off has been merged  with the rest of the crypt, which is thus completely thrown open. Access  to the French church is now obtained from the crypt, and not from outside.  This chantry was founded by the Black Prince in 1363 to commemorate his  marriage with his cousin Joan, the \"Fair Maid of Kent.\" Here, according to  the prince's ordinance, two priests were to pray for his soul, in his  lifetime and after; the situation of the two altars, at which the priests  prayed, can still be traced. On the vaulting we see the arms of the  prince, and of his father, and what seems to be the face of his wife. In  return for the permission to institute this chantry, the prince left to  the monastery of Canterbury an estate which still belongs to the Chapter,  the manor of Fawkes' Hall. This was a piece of land in South Lambeth,  which had been granted by King John to a baron called Fawkes. His name  still survives in the word \"Vauxhall.\"      [2] The above paintings are illustrated in Dart's \"History of    Canterbury,\"   1726, and in \"Archaeologia Cantiana,\" vol. xviii.    [Illustration: IN THE MAIN CRYPT, WITH TOMB OF CARDINAL MORTON  (see p. 99).]    #The Eastern Crypt.#--The eastern portion of the crypt, under the Trinity  Chapel and the corona, is a good deal more lofty than Ernulf's building.  We noticed the ascent from the choir and presbytery to the Trinity Chapel,  and it is, of course, this greater elevation of the cathedral floor at the  east end which accounts for the greater height of the eastern crypt. The  effect, both above and below, is exceedingly happy. The most striking  thing about the interior of the cathedral is the manner in which it  rises--\"church piled upon church\"--from the nave to the corona, and this  characteristic enabled William the Englishman to build a crypt below which  has none of the cramped squatness which generally mars the effect of such  buildings. \"The lofty crypt below,\" says Willis, \"may be considered the  unfettered composition of the English architect. Its style and its details  are wholly different from those of William of Sens. The work, from its  position and office, is of a massive and bold character, but its unusual  loftiness prevents it from assuming the nature of a crypt.... There is one  detail of this crypt which differs especially from the work above. The  abacus of each of the piers, as well as that of each central shaft, is  round; but in the whole of the choir the abacuses are either square, or  square with the corners cut off.\"    It was in the smaller eastern crypt, which formerly occupied the site of  William's building which we are now examining, that Becket was hastily  buried after his assassination, when his murderers were still threatening  to come and drag his body out, \"hang it on a gibbet, tear it with horses,  cut it into pieces, or throw it in some pond to be devoured by swine or  birds of prey.\" And from that time until the translation of the relics in  1220, this was the most sacred spot in the cathedral, and it was known,  down to Reformation times, as \"Becket's tomb.\" Hither came the earliest  pilgrims in the first rush of enthusiasm for the newly-canonized martyr.  And here Henry II. performed that penance, which is one of the most  striking examples of the Church's power presented by history. We are told  that he placed his head and shoulder in the tomb, and there received five  strokes from each bishop and abbot who was present, and three from each of  the eighty monks. After this castigation he spent the night in the crypt,  fasting and barefooted. His penitence and piety were rewarded by the  victory gained at Richmond, on that very day, by his forces over William  the Lion of Scotland, who was taken prisoner, and afterwards, recognizing  the power of the saint, founded the abbey of Aberbrothwick to Saint Thomas  of Canterbury.          CHAPTER IV.    THE HISTORY OF THE SEE.      The history of the See of Canterbury may be said to have begun with the  coming of Augustine, for there can be no doubt that it is owing to its  being the settling-place of the first messengers of the gospel in Saxon  England that Canterbury has been the metropolis of the English Church.  Pope Gregory, with his usual thoroughness, sent to Augustine, soon after  his arrival here, an elaborate scheme for the division of our island  into sees, which were to be gradually developed as Christianity spread.  According to his arrangement, there were to be two archbishops, one at  London and one at York. But we cannot regret that this scheme was not  carried out, as an archiepiscopal see is much more picturesquely framed by  the hills which encircle Canterbury than it could have been by the dingy  vastness of the political and social capital.    #Augustine# reached England in 597, and found that his path had been made  easy by the fact that Bertha, wife of Ethelbert, King of Kent, was a  Christian. He soon effected the conversion of the king himself, and his  labours were so rapidly successful that at Christmas, 597, no less than  ten thousand Saxons were baptized at the mouth of the Medway. The  archiepiscopal pall, and a papal Bull, creating Augustine first English  archbishop, were duly sent from Rome, and the royal palace in Canterbury,  with an old church--Roman or British--close by, were handed over to him by  Ethelbert. The first archbishop died in 605, and was buried, according to  the old Roman custom, by the side of the high road which had brought him  to Canterbury. A few years later, however, his remains were transferred to  the Abbey of SS. Peter and Paul, which had then just been completed.    Augustine was succeeded by one of the monks who had originally come with  him from Rome. The new archbishop's name was #Lawrence#; he had been  already consecrated by Augustine in his lifetime. This unusual measure was  thought to be necessary, as the Church had hardly yet established itself in  a strong position. Indeed, so weak was its hold over its rapidly acquired  converts, that when Ethelbert's son, who succeeded his father in 616,  backslid into the path of heathendom, the great majority of the people  followed the royal example, and Lawrence, together with the Bishops of  London and Rochester, prepared to leave England altogether, as a country  hopelessly abandoned to paganism. However, the archbishop determined to  make one more attempt to maintain his position, and succeeded in  terrifying the king, by a pretended miracle, into becoming a Christian. He  then recalled the two bishops who had already crossed to France, and on  his death, in 619, was succeeded by the Bishop of London, #Mellitus#.  Mellitus only held the Primacy till 624, when his place was filled by  #Justin#, who also had a brief archiepiscopal life, being succeeded in 627  by #Honorius#. This archbishop held the see for twenty-six years, till 653,  and it was not until 655 that his successor was appointed.    So far the archbishops had all been foreigners who had come over either  with Augustine or with the second company of missionaries who were  despatched by Gregory soon after Ethelbert's conversion. In 655, however,  a native Englishman, named Frithona, was consecrated by the Saxon Bishop  of Rochester, and adopted the name of #Deus Dedit#. He ruled at Canterbury  till 664, and after his death the see remained vacant for four years,  probably owing to the plague which was then wasting all Europe, and caused  the death of Wighard, a Saxon, who had started for Rome to receive his  consecration there. But in 668, #Theodore#, a native of Tarsus in Cecilia,  was appointed, and was welcomed by the members of the torn and divided  English Church. He devoted all his energy to centralizing and  consolidating the power of the archbishop, which had been hitherto largely  nominal. He journeyed all over England, correcting the prevalent laxity of  discipline and establishing the control of the metropolitan authority. He  went so far as to interfere with the Archbishopric of York, and with the  help of the king attempted to divide it into three sees. He was,  moreover, an enthusiastic scholar, and first diffused the study of Greek  in England. He had brought a copy of Homer with him, and is said to have  established a school of Greek in Canterbury. He died in 690, and after his  death there was no archbishop for three years. In 693, one #Brethwald#, an  English monk, some time Abbot of Reculver, was appointed to the see. The  Saxon Church shows that it had benefited by Theodore's rigorous  discipline, in that it was henceforth able to"]]]
