If, on removing from the press, the boards will not keep shut, the  book should be pressed again with a folded sheet of blotting-paper in  each end. The blotting-paper should have the folded edge turned up,  and be placed so that this turned-up edge will be in the joint behind  the back edge of the board when the book is shut.    A small nipping-press suitable for giving comparatively light  pressure, is shown at fig. 89.                                 TOOLING ON VELLUM    Most covering vellum has a sticky surface, that marks if it is  handled. This should be washed off with clean water before tooling.  The pattern is blinded in through the paper as for leather, excepting  that the paper must not be pasted directly to the vellum, but may be  held with a band going right round the board or book. It is best to  glaire twice, and to lay on a small portion of gold at a time with  benzine. As vellum burns very readily, the tools must not be too hot,  and some skill is needed to prevent them from slipping on the hard  surface.    Vellum must not be polished or varnished.                                INLAYING ON LEATHER    Inlaying or onlaying is adding a different leather from that of the  cover, as decoration. Thus on a red book, a panel or a border, or  other portion, may be covered with thin green leather, or only flowers  or leaves may be inlaid, while a jewel-like effect may be obtained by  dots, leaves, and flowers, tooled over inlays of various colours.  Leather for inlaying should be pared very thin. To do this the leather  is cut into strips, wetted, and pared on a stone with a knife shaped  somewhat as at fig. 60, B. When the thin leather is dry the inlays of  the leaves and flowers, &c., may be stamped out with steel punches cut  to the shape of the tools; or if only a few inlays are needed, the  tools may be impressed on the thin leather, and the inlays cut out  with a sharp knife. The edges of the larger inlays should be pared  round carefully. For inlaying a panel or other large surface, the  leather is pared very thin and evenly with a French knife, and a piece  of paper pasted on to the grained side and left to dry. When dry, the  shape of the panel, or other space to be inlaid, is marked on it  through the paper pattern, and leather and paper cut through to the  shape required. The edges must then be carefully pared, and the piece  attached with paste, and nipped in the press to make it stick. When  the paste is dry, the paper may be damped and washed off. The object  of the paper is to prevent the thin leather from stretching when it is  pasted.    For white inlays it is better to use Japanese paper than leather, as  white leather, when pared very thin, will show the colours of the  under leather through, and look dirty. If paper is used, it should be  sized with vellum size before tooling.    When many dots or leaves are to be inlaid, the pieces of leather, cut  out with the punch, may be laid face downwards on a paring stone, and  a piece of paper, thickly covered with paste, laid on it. This, on  being taken up, will carry with it the \"inlays,\" and they can be  picked up one at a time on the point of a fine folder, and stuck on  the book.    \"Inlays\" of tools are attached after the pattern has been \"blinded\"  in, and must be again worked over with the tool, in blind, when the  paste is nearly dry.    On vellum an effect, similar to that of inlays on leather, can be  obtained by the use of stains.                                        CHAPTER XV                  Lettering--Blind Tooling--Heraldic Ornament                               LETTERING ON THE BACK    Lettering may be done either with separate letters, each on its own  handle, or with type set in a type-holder and worked across the back  as a pallet. Although by the use of type great regularity is ensured,  and some time saved, the use of handle letters gives so much more  freedom of arrangement, that their use is advocated for extra binding.  Where a great many copies of the same work have to be lettered, the  use of type has obvious advantages.    A great deal depends on the design of the letters used. Nearly all  bookbinders' letters are made too narrow, and with too great  difference between the thick and thin strokes. At fig. 90 is shown an  alphabet, for which I am indebted to the kindness of Mr. Emery Walker.  The long tail of the Q is meant to go under the U. It might be well to  have a second R cut, with a shorter tail, to avoid the great space  left when an A happens to follow it. I have found that four sizes of  letters are sufficient for all books.        [Illustration: FIG. 90.]        [Illustration: FIG. 91.]        [Illustration: FIG. 92.]    To make out a lettering paper for the back of a book, cut a strip of  good thin paper as wide as the height of the panel to be lettered.  Fold it near the centre, and mark the fold with a pencil. This should  give a line exactly at right angles to the top and bottom of the  strip. Then make another fold the distance from the first of the width  of the back; then bring the two folds together, and make a third fold  in the exact centre. The paper should then be as shown at fig. 91.  Supposing the lettering to be THE WORKS OF ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON,  select the size of letter you desire to use, and take an E and mark on  a piece of spare paper a line of E's, and laying your folded paper  against it, see how many letters will go in comfortably. Supposing you  find that four lines of five letters of the selected size can be put  in, you must see if your title can be conveniently cut up into four  lines of five letters, or less. It might be done as shown at fig. 93.  But if you prefer not to split the name STEVENSON, a smaller letter  must be employed, and then the lettering may be as at fig. 94.    To find out the position of the lines of lettering on a panel, the  letter E is again taken and impressed five times at the side of the  panel, as shown at fig. 92, leaving a little greater distance between  the lowest letter and the bottom of the panel, than between the  letters. The paper is then folded on the centre fold, and, with  dividers set to the average distance between the head of one letter  and the head of the next, five points are made through the folded  paper. The paper is opened, turned over, and the points joined with a  fine folder worked against the straight-edge. It should leave on the  front five raised lines, up to which the head of the letters must be  put.        [Illustration: FIG. 93.]        [Illustration: FIG. 94.]    The letters in the top line are counted, and the centre letter marked.  Spaces between words are counted as a letter; thus in \"THE WORKS,\" \"W\"  will be the centre letter, and should be put on the paper first, and  the others added on each side of it. Some thought is needed in judging  where to put the centre, as the difference in the width of such  letters as \"M\" and \"W\" and \"I\" and \"J\" have to be taken into account.    As a general rule, lettering looks best if it comfortably fills the  panel, but of course it cannot always be made to do this. The greatest  difficulty will be found in making titles of books that consist of a  single word, look well. Thus if you have \"CORIOLANUS\" to place on a  back which is not more than 5/8-inch wide, if it is put across as one  word, as at fig. 95 (1), it will be illegible from the smallness of  the type, and will tell merely as a gold line at a little distance. If  a reasonably large type is used, the word must be broken up somewhat,  as at (2), which is perhaps better, but still not at all satisfactory.  The word may be put straight along the back, as at fig. (3), but this  hardly looks well on a book with raised bands, and should be avoided  unless necessary.        [Illustration: FIG. 95.]    The use of type of different sizes in lettering a book should be  avoided when possible, and on no account whatever should letters of  different design be introduced. Occasionally, when the reason for it  is obvious, it may be allowable to make a word shorter by putting in a  small letter, supposing that only thus could reasonably large type be  used. It is especially allowable in cases where, in a set of volumes,  there is one much thinner than the others. It is generally better to  make some compromise with the lettering of the thin volume, than to  spoil the lettering of the whole set by using too small a letter  throughout (see fig. 115).    On very thin books it is sometimes hardly possible to get any  lettering at all on the back. In such cases the lettering is best put  on the side.    In the case of some special books that are to have elaborately  decorated bindings, and are on that account sufficiently distinct from  their neighbours, a certain amount of freedom is permissible with the  lettering, and a little mystery is not perhaps out of place. But in  most cases books have to be recognised by their titles, and it is of  the utmost importance that the lettering should be as clear as  possible, and should fully identify the volume.    For lettering half-bindings and other books on which much time cannot  be spared, it would take too long to make out a paper, as described  for extra bindings, nor is there on such work much occasion for it.  For such books the lettering should be written out carefully, the  whole panel prepared and glaired in, and the gold laid on. Then with a  piece of fine silk or thread lines may be marked across the gold as a  guide to the finisher, and the letters worked from the centre  outward, as described for making out the paper pattern. Of course this  method does not allow of such nice calculation and adjustment as when  a paper pattern is made out; but if a general principle of clear  lettering is recognised and accepted, very good results may be  obtained.

[Music]    I am one in whom Nature has fix'd a Decree,  Ordaining my Life to happy and free;  With no Cares of the World I am never perplex'd,  And never depending, I never am vex'd:  I'm neither of so high nor so low a degree,  But Ambition and Want are both strangers to me;  My life is a compound of Freedom and Ease,  I go where I will, and I work when I please:  I live above Envy, and yet above Spight,  And have Judgment enough for to do my self right;  Some greater and richer I own there may be,  Yet as many live worse, as live better than me,  And few that from Cares live so quiet and free.    When Money comes in I live well 'till it's gone,  So with it I'm happy, Content when I've none:  I spend it Genteelly, and never repent,  If I lose it at Play, why I count it but Lent:  For that which at one time I Lose among Friends,  Another Night's Winnings still makes me amends:  And though I'm without the first Day of the Week,  I still make it out by Shift or by Tick:  In Mirth at my Work the swift Hours do pass,  And by _Saturday_ Night, I'm as rich as I was.    Then let Masters drudge on, and be Slaves to their Trade,  Let their Hours of Pleasure by Business be stay'd;  Let them venture their Stocks to be ruin'd by Trust,  Let Clickers bark on the whole Day at their Post:  Let 'em tire all that pass with their rotified Cant,  \"Will you buy any Shoes, pray see what you want\";  Let the rest of the World still contend to be great,  Let some by their Losses repine at their Fate:  Let others that Thrive, not content with their store,  Be plagu'd with the Trouble and Thoughts to get more.    Let wise Men invent, 'till the World be deceived,  Let Fools thrive thro' Fortune, and Knaves be believed;  Let such as are rich know no Want, but Content,  Let others be plagu'd to pay Taxes and Rent:  With more Freedom and Pleasure my Time I'll employ,  And covet no Blessings but what we enjoy.    Then let's celebrate _Crispin_ with Bumpers and Songs,  And they that drink Foul, may it blister their Tongues,  Here's two in a Hand, and let no one deny 'em,  Since _Crispin_ in Youth was a _Seat's-man_ as I am.          _The Female Scuffle. To the foregoing Tune._      Of late in the Park a fair Fancy was seen,  Betwixt an old _Baud_ and a lusty young _Quean_;  Their parting of Money began the uproar,  I'll have half says the _Baud_, but you shan't says the _Whore_:      Why 'tis my own House,      I care not a Louse,  I'll ha' three parts in four, or you get not a Souse.    'Tis I, says the _Whore_, must take all the Pains,  And you shall be damn'd e'er you get all the Gains;  The _Baud_ being vex'd, straight to her did say,  Come off wi' your _Duds_, and I pray pack away,  And likewise your _Ribbonds_, your _Gloves_, and your _Hair_,  For naked you came, and so out you go bare;      Then _Buttocks_ so bold,      Began for to Scold,  _Hurrydan_ was not able her _Clack_ for to hold.    Both _Pell-Mell_ fell to't, and made this uproar,  With these Compliments, th'art a _Baud_, th'art a _Whore_:  The _Bauds_ and the _Buttocks_ that liv'd there around,  Came all to the Case, both _Pockey_ and _Sound_,  To see what the reason was of this same Fray,  That did so disturb them before it was Day;      If I tell you amiss,      Let me never more Piss,  This _Buttocks_ so bold she named was _Siss_.    By _Quiffing_ with _Cullies_ three Pound she had got,  And but one part of four must fall to her Lot;  Yet all the _Bauds_ cry'd, let us turn her out bare,  Unless she will yield to return her half share;  If she will not, we'll help to strip off her Cloaths,  And turn her abroad with a slit o' the Nose:      Who when she did see,      There was no Remedy,  For her from the Tyranous _Bauds_ to get free;  The _Whore_ from the Money was forced to yield,  And in the Conclusion the _Baud_ got the Field.          _An Elegy on_ MOUNTFORT. _To the foregoing Tune._      Poor _Mountfort_ is gone, and the Ladies do all  Break their Hearts for this Beau, as they did for _Duvall_;  And they the two Brats for this Tragedy damn  At _Kensington_ Court, and the Court of _Bantam_,      They all vow and Swear,      That if any Peer,  Should acquit this young Lord, he shou'd pay very dear;  Nor will they be pleased with him who on the Throne is,  If he do's not his part to revenge their _Adonis_.    With the Widow their amorous Bowels do yearn,  There are divers pretend to an equal Concern;  And by her Perswasion their Hearts they reveal,  In case if not guilty, to bring an Appeal:      They all will unite,      The young Blade to indite,  And in Prosecution will joyn Day and Night;  In the mean time full many a Tear and a Groan is,  Wherever they meet, for their departed _Adonis_.
