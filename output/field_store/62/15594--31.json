The pony neighed wildly, tried to turn, and its shoulder caught the  free, groping hand of the Red and spun the man around and back, so that  he flung up both hands in an effort to ward himself off the rocks. Then  the pony stampeded down the break, its companions catching the same  fever, trailing in a mad dash which kept the Red hard against the  boulders.    He continued to stand there until the horses, save for the wounded one  still kicking fruitlessly, were gone. Travis felt a sense of reprieve.  They might not be able to get at the Red, but he was hurt and afoot, two  strikes which might yet reduce him to a condition the Apaches could  handle.    Apparently the other was also aware of that, for now he pushed out from  the rocks and stumbled along after the ponies. But he went only a step  or two. Then, settling back once more against a convenient boulder, he  began to work at the plate on his chest.    Nolan appeared noiselessly beside Travis. \"What does he do?\" His lips  were very close to the younger man's ear, his voice hardly more than a  breath.    Travis shook his head slightly. The Red's actions were a complete  mystery. Unless, now disabled and afoot, he was trying to summon aid.  Though there was no landing place for a helicopter here.    Now was the time to try and reach Lupe. Travis had seen a slight  movement in the fallen Apache's hand, the first indication that the  enemy's shot had not been as fatal as it had looked. He touched Nolan's  arm, pointed to Lupe; and then, discarding his bow and quiver beside the  war leader, he stripped for action. There was cover down to the wounded  Apache which would aid him. He must pass one of the Tatars on the way,  but none of the tribesmen had shown any signs of life since they had  fallen from their saddles at the first attack.    With infinite care, Travis lowered himself into a narrow passage, took a  lizard's way between brush and boulder, pausing only when he reached the  Tatar for a quick check on the potential enemy.    The lean brown face was half turned, one cheek in the sand, but the  slack mouth, the closed eyes were those, Travis believed, of a dead man.  By some action of his diabolic machine the Red must have snuffed out his  four captives--perhaps in the belief that they were part of the Apache  attack.    Travis reached the rock where Lupe lay. He knew that Nolan was watching  the Red and would give him warning if he suddenly showed an interest in  anything but his machine. The Apache reached out, his hands closing on  Lupe's ankles. Beneath his touch, flesh and muscle tensed. Lupe's eyes  were open, focused now on Travis. There was a bleeding furrow above his  right ear. The Red had tried a difficult head shot, failing in his aim  by a mere fraction of an inch.    Lupe made a swift move for which Travis was ready. His grip on the  other's body helped to tumble them both around a rock which lay between  them and the Red. There was the crack of another shot and dust spurted  from the side of the boulder. But they lay together, safe for the  present, as Travis was sure the enemy would not risk an open attack on  their small fortress.    With Travis' aid Lupe struggled back up to the site where Nolan waited.  Jil-Lee was there to make competent examination of the boy's wound.    \"Creased,\" he reported. \"A sore head, but no great damage. Perhaps a  scar later, warrior!\" He gave Lupe an encouraging thump on the shoulder,  before plastering an aid pack over the cut.    \"Now we go!\" Nolan spoke with emphatic decision.    \"He saw enough of us to know we are not Tatars.\"    Nolan's eyes were cold, his mouth grim as he faced Travis.    \"And how can we fight him--?\"    \"There is a wall--a wall you cannot see--about him,\" Lupe broke in.  \"When I would strike at him, I could not!\"    \"A man with invisible protection and a gun,\" Jil-Lee took up the  argument. \"How would you deal with him, younger brother?\"    \"I don't know,\" Travis admitted. Yet he also believed that if they  withdrew, left the Red here to be found by his own people, the enemy  would immediately begin an investigation of the southern country.  Perhaps, pushed by their need for learning more about the Apaches, they  would bring the helicopter in over the mountains. The answer to all  Apache dangers, for now, lay in the immediate future of this one man.    \"He is hurt, he cannot go far on foot. And even if he calls the 'copter,  there is no landing place. He will have to move elsewhere to be picked  up.\" Travis thought aloud, citing the thin handful of points in their  favor.    Tsoay nodded toward the rim of the ravine. \"Rocks up there and rocks can  roll. Start an earthslide....\"    Something within Travis balked at that. From the first he had been  willing enough to slug it out with the Red, weapon to weapon, man to  man. Also, he had wanted to take a captive, not stand over a body. But  to use the nature of the country against the enemy, that was the oldest  Apache trick of all and one they would have to be forced to employ.    Nolan had already nodded in assent, and Tsoay and Jil-Lee started off.  Even if the Red did possess a protective wall device, could it operate  in full against a landslide? They all doubted that.    The Apaches reached the cliff rim without exposing themselves to the  enemy's fire. The Red still sat there calmly, his back against the rock,  his hands busy with his equipment as if he had all the time in the  world.    Then suddenly came a scream from more than one throat.    \"_Dar-u-gar_!\" The ancient war cry of the Mongol Hordes.    Then over the lip of the other slope rose a wave of men--their curved  swords out, a glazed set to their eyes--heading for the Amerindians with  utter disregard for any personal safety. Menlik in the lead, his  shaman's robe flapping wide below his belt like the wings of some  oversized predatory bird. Hulagur ... Jagatai ... men from the outlaws'  camp. And they were not striving to destroy their disabled overlord in  the vale below, but to wipe out the Apaches!    Only the fact that the Apaches were already sheltered behind the rocks  they were laboring to dislodge gave them a precious few moments of  grace. There was no time to use their bows. They could only use knives  to meet the swords of the Tatars, knives and the fact that they could  fight with unclouded minds.    \"He has them under control!\" Travis pawed at Jil-Lee's shoulder. \"Get  him--they'll stop!\"    He did not wait to see if the other Apache understood. Instead, he threw  the full force of his own body against the rock they had made the center  stone of their slide. It gave, rolled, carrying with it and before it  the rest of the piled rubble. Travis stumbled, fell flat, and then a  body thudded down upon him, and he was fighting for his life to keep a  blade from his throat. Around him were the shouts and cries of embroiled  warriors; then all was silenced by a roar from below.    Glazed eyes in a face only a foot from his own, the twisted, panting  mouth sending gusts of breath into his nostrils. Suddenly there was  reason back in those eyes, a bewilderment, which became fear ...  panic.... The Tatar's body twisted in Travis' hold, striving now not to  attack, but to win free. As the Apache loosened his grip the other  jerked away, so that for a moment or two they lay gasping, side by side.    Men sat up to look at men. There was a spreading stain down Jil-Lee's  side and one of the Tatars sprawled near him, both his hands on his  chest, coughing violently.    Menlik clawed at the trunk of a wind-twisted mountain tree, pulled  himself to his feet, and stood swaying as might a man long ill and  recovering from severe exertion.    Insensibly both sides drew apart, leaving a space between Tatar and  Apache. The faces of the Amerindians were grim, those of the Mongols  bewildered and then harsh as they eyed their late opponents with dawning  reason. What had begun in compulsion for the Tatars might well flare now  into rational combat--and from that to a campaign of extermination.    Travis was on his feet. He looked over the lip of the drop. The Red was  still in his place down there, a pile of rubble about him. His  protection must have failed, for his head was back at an unnatural angle  and the dent in his helmet could be easily seen.    \"That one is dead--or helpless!\" Travis cried out. \"Do you still wish to  fight for him, Shaman?\"    Menlik came away from the tree and walked to the edge of the drop. The  others, too, were moving forward. After the shaman looked down he  stooped, picked up a small stone, and flung it at the motionless Red.  There was a crack of sound. They all saw the tiny spurt of flame, a curl  of smoke from the plate on the Red's chest. Not only the man, but his  control was finished now.    A wolfish growl and two of the Tatars swung over, started down to the  Red. Menlik shouted and they slackened pace.    \"We want that,\" he cried in English. \"Perhaps so we can learn--\"    \"The learning is yours,\" Jil-Lee replied. \"Just as this land is yours,  Shaman. But I warn you, from this day do not ride south!\"    Menlik turned, the charms on his belt clicking. \"So that is the way it  is to be, Apache?\"    \"That is the way it shall be, Tatar! We do not ride to war with allies  who may turn their knives against our backs because they are slaves to a  machine the enemy controls.\"    The Tatar's long, slender-fingered hands opened and closed. \"You are a  wise man, Apache, but sometimes more than wisdom alone is needed----\"    \"We are wise men, Shaman, let it rest there,\" Jil-Lee replied somberly.    Already the Apaches were on their way, putting two cliff ridges behind  them before they halted to examine and cover their wounds.    \"We go.\" Nolan's chin lifted, indicating the southern route. \"Here we  do not come again; there is too much witchcraft in this place.\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25555"],[0,"Fairy Tales of the Slav Peasants and Herdsmen (#20)"],[1,"in the middle of the plain, are  three oaks, and in the centre of these, lying close to the ground, is  an iron door with a copper handle. Behind the door is the horse, also  an invisible club; both are necessary for the work you have to do. You  will learn the rest afterwards. Farewell.\"    This advice astonished the prince greatly; he hardly knew what to do.  After deep reflection he crossed himself, took the magic ring from his  finger and cast it into the sea. Instantly the army vanished like mist  before the wind, and when not a trace of it was left he took the road  to the east. After walking straight on for eight days he reached a  large green plain, in the middle of which grew the three oaks, and in  the centre of these, close to the ground, was the iron door with the  copper handle. Opening the door, he found a winding staircase which  led to a second door bound with iron, and shut by means of a huge  padlock sixty pounds in weight. At this moment he heard the neighing  of a horse, the sound being followed by the opening of eleven other  iron doors. There he saw the war-horse which centuries ago had been  bewitched by a magician. The prince whistled; the horse immediately  bounded towards him, at the same time breaking the twelve iron chains  that fastened him to the manger. He was a beautiful creature, strong,  light, handsome, full of fire and grace; his eyes flashed lightnings,  from his nostrils came flames of fire, his mane was like a cloud of  gold, he was certainly a marvel of a horse.    \"Prince Junak,\" said the steed, \"I have waited centuries for such a  knight as you; here I am, ready to carry you and serve you faithfully.  Mount upon my back, and take hold of the invisible club that hangs at  the pommel of the saddle. You yourself will not need to use it; give  it your orders, it will carry them out and do the fighting itself. Now  we will start; may God look after us! Tell me where you wish to go,  and you shall be there directly.\"    The prince quickly told the horse his history, mounted, seized the  club, and set off. The creature capered, galloped, flew, and swam in  the air higher than the highest forests but lower than the clouds; he  crossed mountains, rivers, and precipices; he barely touched the  blades of grass in passing over them, and went so lightly along the  roads that he did not raise one grain of dust.    Towards sunset Junak found himself close to an immense forest, in the  centre of which stood Yaga's house. All around were oaks and pines  hundreds of years old, untouched by the axe of man. These enormous  trees, lit up by the rays of the setting sun, seemed to look with  astonishment at their strange guest. The silence was absolute; not a  bird sang in the branches, not an insect hummed in the air, not a worm  crawled upon the ground. The only sound was that made by the horse as  he broke through the underwood. Then they came in sight of a small  house supported by a cock's foot, round which it turned as on a  movable pivot. Prince Junak cried:      \"Turn round, little house, turn round,      I want to come inside;    Let thy back to the forest be found,      Thy door to me open wide.\"    The little house turned round, and the prince entering saw old Yaga,  who immediately cried out, \"What, Prince Junak! How have you come  here, where no one ever enters?\"    \"You are a silly old witch, to worry me with questions instead of  making me welcome,\" said the prince.    At these words old Yaga jumped up and hastened to attend to his needs.  She prepared food and drink, made him a soft bed where he could sleep  comfortably, and then leaving the house passed the night out of doors.  On her return in the morning the prince related all his adventures and  confided his plans.    \"Prince Junak,\" said she, \"you have undertaken a very difficult task,  but your courage will enable you to accomplish it successfully. I will  tell you how to kill Kostey, for without that you can do nothing. Now,  in the very midst of the ocean lies the Island of Eternal Life. Upon  this island is an oak tree, and at the foot of it, hidden in the  earth, a coffer bound with iron. A hare is shut up in this coffer, and  under her sits a grey duck whose body contains an egg. Within this egg  is Kostey's life--if it be broken he dies. Good-bye, Prince Junak,  start without loss of time. Your horse will carry you to the island.\"    Junak mounted his horse, spoke a few words to him, and the brave  creature fled through space with the swiftness of an arrow. Leaving  the forest and its enormous trees behind, they soon reached the shores  of the ocean. Fishermen's nets lay on the beach, and in one of them  was a large sea fish who, struggling to free itself, spoke to the  prince in a human voice.    \"Prince Junak,\" he said sadly, \"free me from my prison; I assure you  you will lose nothing by doing me this service.\"    Junak did what was required of him, and threw the fish back into the  water. It plunged and disappeared, but he paid little attention to it,  so occupied was he with his own thoughts. In the far distance could be  seen the rocks of the Island of Eternal Life, but there seemed no way  of reaching it. Leaning on his club he thought and thought, and ever  as he thought he grew sadder and sadder.    \"What is the matter, Prince Junak? Has anything vexed you?\" asked his  horse.    \"How can I help grieving when, while in sight of the island, I can go  no further? How can we cross the sea?\"    [Illustration]    \"Get on my back, prince, I will be your bridge; only take care to hold  on tight.\"    The prince held firmly to its mane, and the horse leapt into the sea.  At first they were plunged right beneath the waves, but rising again  to the surface swam easily across. The sun was about to set when the  prince dismounted on the Island of Eternal Life. He first took off his  horse's harness, and leaving him to browse on the green grass, hurried  to the top of a distant hill, whence he could see a large oak. Without  losing a moment he hastened towards it, seized the tree with both  hands, pulled at it with all his might, and after the most violent  efforts tore it up by the roots from the place it had filled for  centuries. The tree groaned and fell, and the hole in which it had  been planted appeared like an immense case. Right at the bottom of  this case was a coffer bound with iron. The prince took it up, broke  the lock by striking it with a stone, opened it and seized the hare  that was trying to make its escape. The grey duck that had lain  underneath flew off towards the sea: the prince fired, struck the  bird, the latter dropped its egg into the sea, and both were swallowed  by the waves. Junak gave a cry of despair and rushed to the beach. At  first he could see nothing. After a few minutes there was a slight  movement of the waves, while upon the surface swam the fish whose life  he had saved. It came towards him, right on to the sand, and dropping  the lost egg at his feet, said: \"You see, prince, I have not forgotten  your kindness, and now I have found it in my power to be of service to  you.\"    Having thus spoken it disappeared in the water. The prince took the  egg, mounted his horse, and crossing the sea with his heart full of  hope, journeyed towards the island where Princess Sudolisu kept watch  over her sleeping subjects in the Enchanted Palace. The latter was  surrounded by a wall, and guarded by the Dragon with Twelve Heads. Now  these heads went to sleep in turn, six at a time, so it was impossible  to take him unawares or to kill him, for that could be done only by  his own blows.    On reaching the palace gates Junak sent his invisible club forward to  clear the way, whereupon it threw itself upon the dragon, and began to  beat all the heads unmercifully. The blows came so thick and fast that  the body was soon crushed to pieces. Still the dragon lived and beat  the air with its claws. Then it opened its twelve jaws from which  darted pointed tongues, but it could not lay hold of the invisible  club. At last, tormented on all sides and filled with rage, it buried  its sharp claws in its own body and died. The prince then entered the  palace gates, and having put his faithful horse in the stables and  armed himself with his invisible club, made his way for the tower in  which the princess was shut up. On seeing him she cried out, \"Prince,  I rejoiced to see your victory over the dragon. There is yet a more  terrible foe to conquer, and he is my jailor, the cruel Kostey. Beware  of him, for if he should kill you, I shall throw myself out of window  into the precipice beneath.\"    \"Be comforted, my princess: for in this egg I hold the life or death  of Kostey.\"    Then turning to the invisible club, he said, \"Press forward, my  invisible club; strike your best, and rid the earth of this wicked  giant.\"    The club began by breaking down the iron doors, and thus reached  Kostey. The giant was soon so crippled with blows that his teeth were  smashed, lightnings flashed from his eyes, and he rolled round and  round like a pin-cushion. Had he been a man he must have died under  such treatment. But he was no man, this master of sorcery. So he  managed to get on his feet and look for his tormentor. The blows from  the club rained hard upon him all the time, and with such effect that  his groans could be heard all over the island. On approaching the  window he saw Prince Junak.    \"Ah, wretch!\" cried the ogre, \"it is you, is it, who torments me in  this way!\" and he prepared to blow upon him with his poisonous breath.  But the prince instantly crushed the egg between his hands, the shell  broke, the white and yellow mingled and flowed to the ground, and  Kostey died.    As the sorcerer breathed his last, the enchantments vanished and the  sleeping islanders awoke. The army, once more afoot, advanced with  beating drums to the palace, and everything fell into its accustomed  place. As soon as "]]]
