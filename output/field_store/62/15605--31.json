Receive this ring, the pledge of your faith, that you  may be called the spouse of God.\" She fell on her knees, and sung, \"I am  married to him whom angels serve, whose beauty the sun and moon admire;\"  then rising, and showing with exultation her right hand, she said,  emphatically, as if to impress it on the attention of the congregation,  \"My Lord has wedded me with this ring, and decorated me with a crown as  his spouse. I here renounce and despise all earthly ornaments for his  sake, whom alone I see, whom alone I love, in whom alone I trust, and to  whom alone I give all my affections. My heart hath uttered a good word:  I speak of the deed I have done for my King.\" The bishop then pronounced  a general benediction, and retired up to the altar; while the nun  professed was borne off between her friends, with lighted tapers, and  garlands waving.        WEDDED LOVE IS INFINITELY PREFERABLE TO VARIETY.      Hail, wedded love, mysterious law, true source    Of human offspring, sole propriety,    In Paradise of all things common else!        By thee adult'rous lust was driven from men,    Among the bestial herds to range; by thee,    Founded in reason, loyal, just and pure,    Relations dear, and all the charities    Of father, son, and brother, first were known.        Thou art the fountain of domestic sweets,    Whose bed is undefiled and chaste pronounced.    Here Love his golden shafts employs, here lights    His constant lamp, and waves his purple wings,    Reigns here and revels; not in the bought smile    Of harlots, loveless, joyless, unendear'd,    Casual fruition; nor in court amours,    Mix'd dance, or wanton mask, or midnight ball,    Or serenade, which the starved lover sings    To his proud fair, best quitted with disdain.      ITALIAN DEBAUCHERY.    If chastity is none of the most shining virtues of the French, it is  still less so of the Italians. Almost all the travellers who have  visited Italy, agree in describing it as the most abandoned of all the  countries of Europe. At Venice, at Naples, and indeed in almost every  part of Italy, women are taught from their infancy, the various arts of  alluring to their arms, the young and unwary, and of obtaining from  them, while heated by love or wine, every thing that flattery and false  smiles can obtain in those unguarded moments: and so little infamous is  the trade of prostitution, and so venal the women, that hardly any rank  or condition set them above being bribed to it, nay, they are frequently  assisted by their male friends and acquaintances to drive a good  bargain; nor does their career of debauchery finish with their unmarried  state; the vows of fidelity which they make at the altar, are like the  vows and oaths made upon too many other occasions, only considered as  nugatory forms, which law has obliged them to take, but custom absolved  them from performing. They even claim and enjoy greater liberties after  marriage than before; every married woman has a cicisbey, or gallant,  who attends her to all public places, hands her in and out of her  carriage, picks up her gloves or fan, and a thousand other little  offices of the same natures; but this is only his public employment, as  a reward for which, he is entitled to have the lady as often as he  pleases at a place of retirement sacred to themselves, where no person  not even the most intrusive husband must enter, to be witness of what  passes between them. This has been considered by people of other  nations, as a custom not altogether consistent with chastity and purity  of manners; the Italians themselves however, endeavor to justify it in  their conversations with strangers, and Baretti has of late years  published a formal vindication of it to the world. In this vindication  he has not only deduced the original of it from pure Platonic love, but  would willingly persuade us that it is still continued upon the same  mental principles; a doctrine which the world will hardly be credulous  enough to swallow, even though he should offer more convincing arguments  to support it than he has already done.      NAKED FAKIERS    So different over all the world are the sects of saints as well as of  sinners, that besides the Bramins, a set of innocent and religious  priests, who have rendered their women virtuous by treating them with  kindness and humanity, there are another sect of religio-philosophical  drones, called Fakiers, who contribute as much as they can to debauch  the sex, under a pretence of superior sanctity. These hypocritical  saints, like some of the ridiculous sects which formerly existed in  Europe, wear no clothes; considering them only as proper appendages to  sinners, who are ashamed, because they are sensible of guilt; while  they, being free from every stain of pollution, have no shame to cover.  In this original state of nature, these idle and pretended devotees,  assemble together sometimes in armies of ten or twelve thousand, and  under a pretence of going in pilgrimage to certain temples, like locusts  devour every thing on their way; the men flying before them, and  carrying all that they can out of the reach of their depredations; while  the women, not in the least afraid of a naked army of lusty saints,  throw themselves in their way, or remain quietly at home to receive  them.    It has long been an opinion, well established all over India, that there  is not in nature so powerful a remedy for removing the sterility of  women, as the prayers of these sturdy naked saints. On this account,  barren women constantly apply to them for assistance; which when the  good natured Fakier has an indication to grant, he leaves his slipper,  or his staff at the door of the lady's apartment with whom he is  praying; a symbol so sacred, that it effectually prevents any one from  violating the secrecy of their devotion; but should he forget this  signal, and at the same time be distant from the protection of his  brethren, a sound drubbing is frequently the reward of his pious  endeavors. But though they venture sometimes in Hindostan, to treat a  Fakier in this unholy manner, in other parts of Asia and Africa, such is  the veneration in which these lusty saints are held, that they not only  have access when they please, to perform private devotions with barren  women, but are accounted so holy, that they may at any time, in public  or private, confer a personal favor upon a woman, without bringing upon  her either shame or guilt; and no woman dare refuse to gratify their  passion. Nor indeed, has any one an inclination of this kind; because  she, upon whom this personal favor has been conferred, is considered by  herself, and by all the people, as having been sanctified and made more  holy by the action.    So much concerning the conduct of the Fakiers in debauching women, seems  certain. But it is by travellers further related, that wherever they  find a woman who is exceedingly handsome, they carry her off privately  to one of their temples; but in such a manner, as to make her and the  people believe, that she is carried away by the god who is there  worshipped; who being violently in love with her, took that method to  procure her for his wife. This done, they perform a nuptial ceremony,  and make her further believe that she is married to the god; when, in  reality, she is only married to one of the Fakiers who personates him.  Women who are treated in this manner are revered by the people as the  wives of the gods, and by that stratagem secured solely to the Fakiers,  who have cunning enough to impose themselves as gods upon some of these  women, through the whole of their lives. In countries where reason is  stronger than superstition, we almost think this impossible: where the  contrary is the case, there is nothing too hard to be credited.  Something like this was done by the priests of ancient Greece and Rome;  and a few centuries ago, tricks of the same nature were practiced by the  monks, and other libertines, upon some of the visionary and enthusiastic  women of Europe. Hence we need not think it strange, if the Fakiers  generally succeed in attempts of this nature; when we consider that they  only have to deceive a people brought up in the most consummate  ignorance; and that nothing can be more flattering to female vanity,  than for a woman to suppose herself such a peculiar favorite of the  divinity she worships, as to be chosen, from all her companions, to the  honor of being admitted to his embraces; a favor, which her  self-admiration will dispose her more readily to believe than examine.      MAHOMETAN PLURALITY OF WIVES.    But it is not the religion of the Hindoos only, that is unfavorable to  chastity; that of Mahomet which now prevails over a great part of India,  is unfavorable to it likewise.

The voluntary  contributions of his wealthy hearers, Aldermen and Deputies, West India  merchants and Turkey merchants, Wardens of the Company of Fishmongers  and Wardens of the Company of Goldsmiths, enabled him to become a  landowner or a mortgagee. The best broadcloth from Blackwell Hall, and  the best poultry from Leadenhall Market, were frequently left at his  door. His influence over his flock was immense. Scarcely any member of  a congregation of separatists entered into a partnership, married a  daughter, put a son out as apprentice, or gave his vote at an election,  without consulting his spiritual guide. On all political and literary  questions the minister was the oracle of his own circle. It was  popularly remarked, during many years, that an eminent dissenting  minister had only to make his son an attorney or a physician; that the  attorney was sure to have clients, and the physician to have patients.  While a waiting woman was generally considered as a help meet for  a chaplain in holy orders of the Established Church, the widows and  daughters of opulent citizens were supposed to belong in a peculiar  manner to nonconformist pastors. One of the great Presbyterian Rabbies,  therefore, might well doubt whether, in a worldly view, he should  be benefited by a comprehension. He might indeed hold a rectory or  a vicarage, when he could get one. But in the meantime he would be  destitute: his meeting house would be closed: his congregation would be  dispersed among the parish churches: if a benefice were bestowed on him,  it would probably be a very slender compensation for the income which  he had lost. Nor could he hope to have, as a minister of the Anglican  Church, the authority and dignity which he had hitherto enjoyed. He  would always, by a large portion of the members of that Church, be  regarded as a deserter. He might therefore, on the whole, very naturally  wish to be left where he was. [89]    There was consequently a division in the Whig party. One section of that  party was for relieving the dissenters from the Test Act, and giving  up the Comprehension Bill. Another section was for pushing forward  the Comprehension Bill, and postponing to a more convenient time the  consideration of the Test Act. The effect of this division among the  friends of religious liberty was that the High Churchmen, though a  minority in the House of Commons, and not a majority in the House of  Lords, were able to oppose with success both the reforms which they  dreaded. The Comprehension Bill was not passed; and the Test Act was not  repealed.    Just at the moment when the question of the Test and the question of the  Comprehension became complicated together in a manner which might well  perplex an enlightened and honest politician, both questions became  complicated with a third question of grave importance.    The ancient oaths of allegiance and supremacy contained some expressions  which had always been disliked by the Whigs, and other expressions which  Tories, honestly attached to the new settlement, thought inapplicable to  princes who had not the hereditary right. The Convention had therefore,  while the throne was still vacant, framed those oaths of allegiance and  supremacy by which we still testify our loyalty to our Sovereign. By the  Act which turned the Convention into a Parliament, the members of both  Houses were required to take the new oaths. As to other persons in  public trust, it was hard to say how the law stood. One form of words  was enjoined by statutes, regularly passed, and not yet regularly  abrogated. A different form was enjoined by the Declaration of Right, an  instrument which was indeed revolutionary and irregular, but which might  well be thought equal in authority to any statute. The practice was in  as much confusion as the law. It was therefore felt to be necessary that  the legislature should, without delay, pass an Act abolishing the old  oaths, and determining when and by whom the new oaths should be taken.    The bill which settled this important question originated in the Upper  House. As to most of the provisions there was little room for dispute.  It was unanimously agreed that no person should, at any future time, be  admitted to any office, civil, military, ecclesiastical, or academical,  without taking the oaths to William and Mary. It was also unanimously  agreed that every person who already held any civil or military office  should be ejected from it, unless he took the oaths on or before the  first of August 1689. But the strongest passions of both parties  were excited by the question whether persons who already possessed  ecclesiastical or academical offices should be required to swear fealty  to the King and Queen on pain of deprivation. None could say what might  be the effect of a law enjoining all the members of a great, a powerful,  a sacred profession to make, under the most solemn sanction of  religion, a declaration which might be plausibly represented as a formal  recantation of all that they had been writing and preaching during many  years. The Primate and some of the most eminent Bishops had already  absented themselves from Parliament, and would doubtless relinquish  their palaces and revenues, rather than acknowledge the new Sovereigns.  The example of these great prelates might perhaps be followed by  a multitude of divines of humbler rank, by hundreds of canons,  prebendaries, and fellows of colleges, by thousands of parish priests.  To such an event no Tory, however clear his own conviction that he might  lawfully swear allegiance to the King who was in possession, could  look forward without the most painful emotions of compassion for the  sufferers and of anxiety for the Church.    There were some persons who went so far as to deny that the Parliament  was competent to pass a law requiring a Bishop to swear on pain of  deprivation. No earthly power, they said, could break the tie which  bound the successor of the apostles to his diocese. What God had joined  no man could sunder. Dings and senates might scrawl words on parchment  or impress figures on wax; but those words and figures could no more  change the course of the spiritual than the course of the physical  world. As the Author of the universe had appointed a certain order,  according to which it was His pleasure to send winter and summer,  seedtime and harvest, so He had appointed a certain order, according to  which He communicated His grace to His Catholic Church; and the latter  order was, like the former, independent of the powers and principalities  of the world. A legislature might alter the flames of the months, might  call June December, and December June; but, in spite of the legislature,  the snow would fall when the sun was in Capricorn, and the flowers would  bloom when he was in Cancer. And so the legislature might enact that  Ferguson or Muggleton should live in the palace at Lambeth, should sit  on the throne of Augustin, should be called Your Grace, and should  walk in processions before the Premier Duke; but, in spite of the  legislature, Sancroft would, while Sancroft lived, be the only true  Archbishop of Canterbury; and the person who should presume to usurp the  archiepiscopal functions would be a schismatic. This doctrine was proved  by reasons drawn from the budding of Aaron's rod, and from a certain  plate which Saint James the Less, according to a legend of the fourth  century, used to wear on his forehead. A Greek manuscript, relating  to the deprivation of bishops, was discovered, about this time, in the  Bodleian Library, and became the subject of a furious controversy. One  party held that God had wonderfully brought this precious volume to  light, for the guidance of His Church at a most critical moment. The  other party wondered that any importance could be attached to the  nonsense of a nameless scribbler of the thirteenth century. Much was  written about the deprivations of Chrysostom and Photius, of Nicolaus  Mysticus and Cosmas Atticus. But the case of Abiathar, whom Solomon put  out of the sacerdotal office for treason, was discussed with peculiar  eagerness. No small quantity of learning and ingenuity was expended  in the attempt to prove that Abiathar, though he wore the ephod and  answered by Urim, was not really High Priest, that he ministered  only when his superior Zadoc was incapacitated by sickness or by some  ceremonial pollution, and that therefore the act of Solomon was not a  precedent which would warrant King William in deposing a real Bishop.  [90]    But such reasoning as this, though backed by copious citations from the  Misna and Maimonides, was not generally satisfactory even to zealous  churchmen. For it admitted of one answer, short, but perfectly  intelligible to a plain man who knew nothing about Greek fathers or  Levitical genealogies. There might be some doubt whether King Solomon  had ejected a high priest; but there could be no doubt at all that Queen  Elizabeth had ejected the Bishops of more than half the sees in England.  It was notorious that fourteen prelates had, without any proceeding in  any spiritual court, been deprived by Act of Parliament for refusing to  acknowledge her supremacy. Had that deprivation been null? Had Bonner  continued to be, to the end of his life, the only true Bishop of  London? Had his successor been an usurper? Had Parker and Jewel been  schismatics? Had the Convocation of 1562, that Convocation which had  finally settled the doctrine of the Church of England, been itself out  of the pale of the Church of Christ? Nothing could be more ludicrous  than the distress of those controversialists who had to invent a plea  for Elizabeth which should not be also a plea for William. Some zealots,  indeed, gave up the vain attempt to distingush between two cases which  every man of common sense perceived to be undistinguishable, and frankly  owned that the deprivations of"]]]
