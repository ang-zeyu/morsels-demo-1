As an English writer remarks: \"The Asiatic  is not delighted with justice _per se_; indeed, the Asiatic really cares  but little about it if he can get _sympathy_ in the sense in which he  understands that misunderstood word.... This is the real reason why  every Asiatic in his heart of hearts prefers the rule of his own  nationality, bad though it be, to the most ideal rule of aliens. For  when he is ruled by his own countrymen, he is dealt with by people who  understand his frailties, and who, though they may savagely punish him,  are at least in sympathy with the motives which prompt his  delinquencies.\"[95]    Take again the matter of order. The average Oriental not only does not  appreciate, but detests, our well-regulated, systematic manner of life.  Accustomed as he has been for centuries to a slipshod, easygoing  existence, in which, if there was much injustice, there was also much  favouritism, he instinctively hates things like sanitary measures and  police regulations. Accustomed to a wide \"personal liberty\" in the  anarchic sense, he is not willing to limit this liberty for the common  weal. He wants his own way, even though it involves possible dangers to  himself--dangers which may always be averted by bribery, favouritism, or  violence. Said an American who had listened to a Filipino's glowing  words on independence: \"What could you do, if you were independent, that  you cannot do now?\" \"I could build my house there in the middle of the  street, if I wanted to.\" \"But suppose your neighbour objected and  interfered?\" \"I would 'get' him.\" \"But suppose he 'got' you?\" A shrug of  the shoulders was the only answer.[96]    The fact is that the majority of Orientals, despite the considerable  penetration of Western ideas and methods that has been going on for the  last century, still love their old ruts and hate to be budged out of  them. They realize that Western rule furthers more than anything else  the Westernization of their social system, their traditional manner of  life, and they therefore tend to react fanatically against it. Every  innovation imposed by the colonial authorities is apt to rouse the most  purblind resistance. For example, compulsory vaccination was bitterly  opposed for years by the natives of Algeria. The French officials  pointed out that smallpox, hitherto rampant, was being rapidly  extirpated. The natives replied that, in their opinion, it was merely a  crafty scheme for sterilizing them sexually and thus make room for  French colonists. The officials thereupon pointed to the census figures,  which showed that the natives were increasing at an unprecedented rate.  The natives merely shrugged their shoulders and continued to inveigh  against the innovation.    This whole matter has been well summarized by a French writer with a  wide knowledge of Mohammedan lands. Says Louis Bertrand:    \"In reality, all these peoples, indisposed as they are by their  traditions, customs, and climates to live according to our social ideal,  hate to endure the constraint of our police, of our administration--in a  word, of any sort of _regulated_ government, no matter how just and  honest. Delivered from the most anarchic and vexatious of tyrannies,  they remain in spirit more or less like our vagabonds, always hoping to  escape from the gendarmes. In vain do we point out to the Arabs of North  Africa that, thanks to the protection of France, they are no longer  pillaged by Turkish despots nor massacred and tortured by rival tribes.  They see only one thing: the necessity of paying taxes for matters that  they do not understand. We shall never realize the rage, the fury,  aroused in our Algerian towns by the simple health department ordinance  requiring the emptying of a garbage-can at a fixed hour. At Cairo and  elsewhere I have observed the same rebellious feelings among the  donkey-boys and cab-drivers subjected to the regulations of the English  policeman.    \"But it is not merely our municipal and administrative regulations which  they find insupportable; it is all our habits, taken _en bloc_--in a  word, the _order_ which regulates our civilized life. For instance: on  the railway-line from Jaffa to Jerusalem the train stops at a station  beside which stands the tomb of a holy man. The schedule calls for a  stop of a minute at most. But no sooner had we arrived than what was my  stupefaction to see all the Mohammedans on the train get off, spread  their prayer-rugs, and tranquilly begin their devotions. The  station-master blew his whistle, the conductor yelled at them that he  was going to leave them behind; nobody budged. A squad of railway  employees had to be mobilized, who, with blows and curses, finally  bundled these pious persons back into the train again. The business  lasted a good quarter of an hour, and was not easy. The more vigorous of  the worshippers put up an energetic resistance.    \"The above is only a casual instance, chosen at random. What is certain  is that these peoples do not yet understand what we mean by exactitude,  and that the concept of a well-regulated existence has not yet  penetrated their heads.\"[97]    What has just been written of course applies primarily to the ignorant  masses. But this attitude of mind is more or less common to all classes  of Oriental peoples. The habits of centuries are not easily transformed.  In fact, it must not be forgotten that the upper classes were able to  enjoy most fully the capricious personal liberty of the unmodified East,  and that, therefore, though they may be better able to understand the  value of Westernization, they have in one sense the most to lose.[98]    In fact, for all Orientals, high and low alike, the \"good old times\"  had charms which they mournfully regret. For the prince, the pasha, the  courtier, existence was truly an Oriental paradise. To be sure, the  prince might at any moment be defeated and slain by a rival monarch; the  pasha strangled at his master's order; the courtier tortured through a  superior's whim. But, meanwhile, it was \"life,\" rich and full. \"Each of  these men had his own character and his own renown among his countrymen,  and each enjoyed a position such as is now unattainable in Europe, in  which he was released from laws, could indulge his own fancies, bad or  good, and was fed every day and all day with the special flattery of  Asia--that willing submissiveness to mere volition which is so like  adoration, and which is to its recipients the most intoxicating of  delights. Each, too, had his court of followers, and every courtier  shared in the power, the luxury, and the adulation accruing to his lord.  The power was that of life and death; the luxury included possession of  every woman he desired; the adulation was, as I have said, almost  religious worship.\"[99]    But, it may be asked, what about the poor man, exploited by this  hierarchy of capricious despots? What had he to gain from all this?  Well, in most cases, he got nothing at all; but he _might_ gain a great  deal. Life in the old Orient was a gigantic lottery. Any one, however  humble, who chanced to please a great man, might rise to fame and  fortune at a bound. And this is just what pleases the Eastern  temperament; for in the East, \"luck\" and caprice are more prized than  the \"security\" cherished in the West. In the Orient the favourite  stories are those narrating sudden and amazing shifts of  fortune--beggars become viziers or viziers become beggars, and all in a  single night. To the majority of Orientals it is still the uncertainties  of life, and the capricious favour of the powerful, which make it most  worth living; not the sure reward of honesty and well-regulated labour.  All these things made the life of the Orient infinitely _interesting_  to _all_. And it is precisely this gambler's interest which  Westernization has more or less destroyed. As an English writer very  justly remarks _a propos_ of modern Egypt: \"Our rule may be perfect, but  the East finds it dull. The old order was a ragged garment, but it was  gay. Its very vicissitude had a charm. 'Ah! yes,' said an Egyptian to a  champion of English rule, 'but in the old days a beggar might sit at the  gate, and if he were found pleasing in the eyes of a great lady, he  might be a great man on the morrow.' There is a natural and inevitable  regret for the gorgeous and perilous past, when favour took the place of  justice, and life had great heights and depths--for the Egypt of Joseph,  Haroun-al-Rashid, and Ismail Pasha. We have spread the coat of  broadcloth over the radiant garment.\"[100]    Saddened and irritated by the threatened loss of so much that they hold  dear, it is not strange that many Eastern conservatives glorify the past  as a sort of Golden Age, infinitely superior to anything the West can  produce, and in this they are joined by many quondam liberals,  disillusioned with Westernism and flying into the arms of reaction. The  result is a spirit of hatred against everything Western, which sometimes  assumes the most extravagant forms. Says Louis Bertrand: \"During a  lecture that I attended at Cairo the speaker contended that France owed  Islam (1) its civilization and sciences; (2) half of its vocabulary; (3)  all that was best in the character and mentality of its population,  seeing that, from the Middle Ages to the Revolution of 1789, all the  reformers who laboured for its enfranchisement--Albigensians, Vaudois,  Calvinists, and Camisards--were probably descendants of the Saracens. It  was nothing less than the total annexation of France to Morocco.\"  Meanwhile, \"it has become the fashion for fervent (Egyptian)  nationalists to go to Spain and meditate in the gardens of the Alcazar  of Seville or in the patios of the Alhambra of Granada on the defunct  splendours of western Islam.\"[101]    Even more grotesque are the rhapsodies of the Hindu wing of this "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24159"],[0,"Customs and Fashions in Old New England (#20)"],[1,"y.    The earliest and most natural, as well as most plentiful, illuminating  medium for the colonists was found in pine-knots. Wood says:         \"Out of these Pines is gotten the Candlewood that is so much spoke       of which may serve as a shift among poore folks but I cannot       commend it for Singular good because it is something sluttish       dropping a pitchy kind of substance where it stands.\"    Higginson wrote in 1630, \"Though New England has no tallow to make  candles of yet by abundance of fish thereof it can afford oil for  lamps.\"    Though lamps and \"lamp yearne,\" or wicks, appear in many an early  invoice, I cannot think that they were extensively used. Betty lamps  were the earliest form. They were a shallow receptacle, usually of  pewter, iron, or brass, circular or oval in shape, and occasionally  triangular, and about two or three inches in diameter, with a projecting  nose an inch or two long. When in use they were filled with tallow or  grease, and a wick or piece of twisted rag was placed so that the  lighted end could hang on the nose. Specimens can be seen at Deerfield  Memorial Hall. I have one with a hook and chain by which to hang it up,  and a handled hook attached with which to clean out the grease. These  lamps were sometimes called \"brown-bettys,\" or \"kials,\" or \"cruiseys.\" A  ph[oe]be lamp resembled a betty lamp, but had a shallow cup underneath  to catch the dripping grease.    Soon candles were made by being run in moulds, or by a tedious process  of dipping. The fragrant bayberry furnished a pale green wax, which  Robert Beverly thus described in 1705:         \"A pale brittle wax of a curious green color, which by refining       becomes almost transparent. Of this they make candles which are       never greasy to the touch, nor melt with lying in the hottest       weather; neither does the snuff of these ever offend the smell,       like that of a tallow candle; but, instead of being disagreeable,       if an accident puts a candle out, it yields a pleasant fragrancy to       all that are in the room; insomuch that nice people often put them       out on purpose to have the incense of the expiring snuff.\"    The Abbe Robin and other travellers gave similar testimony. Bayberry wax  was a standard farm production wherever bayberries grew, and was  advertised in New England papers until this century. I entered within a  year a single-storied house a few miles from Plymouth Rock, where an  aged descendant of the Pilgrims earns her scanty spending-money by  making \"bayberry taller,\" and bought a cake and candles of the wax, made  in precisely the method of her ancestors; and I too can add my evidence  as to the pure, spicy perfume of this New England incense.    The growth of the whaling trade, and consequent use of spermaceti, of  course increased the facilities for, and the possibilities of, house  illumination. In 1686 Governor Andros petitioned for a commission for a  voyage after \"Sperma-Coeti Whales,\" but not till the middle of the  following century did spermaceti become of common enough use to bring  forth such notices as this, in the _Boston Independent Advertiser_ of  January, 1749:         \"Sperma-Ceti Candles, exceeding all others for Beauty Sweetness of       Scent when Extinguished. Duration being more than Double with       Tallow Candles of Equal Size. Dimensions of Flame near 4 Times       more. Emitting a Soft easy Expanding Light, bringing the object       close to the Sight, rather than causing the Eye to trace after       them, as all Tallow Candles do, from a Constant Dimnes which they       produce. One of these Candles serves the use and purpose of 3       Tallow Candles, and upon the Whole are much pleasanter and       cheaper.\"    These candles were placed in candle-beams--rude chandeliers of crossed  sticks of wood or strips of metal with sockets; in sliding stands, in  sconces, which were also called prongs or candle-arms. The latter  appeared in the inventories of all genteel folk, and decorated the walls  of all genteel parlors.    Candlesticks and snuffers were found in every house; the latter were  called by various names, the word snit or snite being the most curious.  It is from the old English snyten, to blow, and was originally a  verb--to snite the candle, or put it out. In the inventory of property  of John Gager, of Norwich, in 1703, appears \"One Snit.\"    Snuffer-boats or slices were snuffer-trays. Another curious illuminating  appurtenance was called a save-all or candle-wedge. It was a little  frame of rings or cups with pins, by which our frugal ancestors held up  the last dying bit of burning candle. They were sometimes of pewter with  iron pins, sometimes wholly of brass or iron. They have nearly all  disappeared since new and more extravagant methods of illumination  prevail.    The argand lamps of Jefferson's invention and the various illuminating  and heating contrivances of Count Rumford must have been welcome to the  colonists.    The discomfort of a colonial house in winter-time has been ably set  forth by Charles Francis Adams in his \"Three Episodes of Massachusetts  History.\" Down the great chimneys blew the icy blasts so fiercely that  Cotton Mather noted on a January Sabbath, in 1697, as he shivered before  \"a great Fire, that the Juices forced out at the end of short billets of  wood by the heat of the flame on which they were laid, yett froze into  Ice on their coming out.\" Judge Sewall wrote, twenty years later, \"An  Extraordinary Cold Storm of Wind and Snow. Bread was frozen at Lords  Table.... Though 'twas so Cold yet John Tuckerman was baptized. At six  oclock my ink freezes so that I can hardly write by a good fire in my  Wives Chamber\"--and the pious man adds (we hope with truth) \"Yet was  very Comfortable at Meeting.\" Cotton Mather tells, in his pompous  fashion, of a cold winter's day four years later. \"Tis Dreadful cold, my  ink glass in my standish is froze and splitt in my very stove. My ink in  my pen suffers a congelation.\" If sitting-rooms were such refrigerators,  we cannot wonder that the chilled colonists wished to sleep in beds  close curtained with heavy woollen stuffs, or in slaw-bank beds by the  kitchen fire.    The settlers builded as well as they knew to keep their houses warm; and  while the vast and virgin forests supplied abundant and accessible wood  for fuel, Governor Eaton's nineteen great fireplaces and Parson  Davenport's thirteen, could be well filled; but by 1744 Franklin could  write of these big chimneys as the \"fireplace of our fathers;\" for the  forests had all disappeared in the vicinity of the towns, and the  chimneys had shrunk in size. Sadly did the early settlers need warmer  houses, for, as all antiquarian students have noted, in olden days the  cold was more piercing, began to nip and pinch earlier in November, and  lingered further into spring; winter rushed upon the settlers with  heavier blasts and fiercer storms than we now have to endure. And, above  all, they felt with sadder force \"the dreary monotony of a New England  winter, which leaves so large a blank, so melancholy a death-spot, in  lives so brief that they ought to be all summer-time.\" Even John Adams  in his day so dreaded the tedious bitter New England winter that he  longed to hibernate like a dormouse from autumn to spring.    As the forests disappeared, sea-coal was brought over in small  quantities, and stoves appeared for town use. By 1695 and 1700 we find  Cotton Mather and Judge Sewall speaking of stoves and stove-rooms, and  of chambers warmed by stoves. Ere that one John Clark had patented an  invention for \"saving and warming rooms,\" but we know nothing definite  of its shape.    Dutch stoves and china stoves were the first to be advertised in New  England papers; then \"Philadelphia Fire Stoves\"--what we now term  Franklin grates. Wood was burned in these grates. We find clergymen,  until after Revolutionary times, having sixty or eighty cords of  hardwood given to them annually by the parish.    Around the great glowing fireplace in an old New England kitchen centred  all of homeliness and comfort that could be found in a New England home.  The very aspect of the domestic hearth was picturesque, and must have  had a beneficent influence. In earlier days the great lug-pole, or, as  it was called in England, the back-bar, stretched from ledge to ledge,  or lug to lug, high up the yawning chimney, and held a motley collection  of pot-hooks and trammels, of gib-crokes, twicrokes, and hakes, which in  turn suspended at various heights over the fire, pots, and kettles and  other cooking utensils. In the hearth-corners were displayed skillets  and trivets, peels and slices, and on either side were chimney-seats and  settles. Above--on the clavel-piece--were festooned strings of dried  apples, pumpkins, and peppers.    The lug-pole, though made of green wood, sometimes became brittle or  charred by too long use over the fire and careless neglect of  replacement, and broke under its weighty burden of food and metal; hence  accidents became so frequent, to the detriment of precious cooking  utensils, and even to the destruction of human safety and life, that a  Yankee invention of an iron crane brought convenience and simplicity,  and added a new grace to the kitchen hearth.    The andirons added to the fireplace their homely charm. Fire-dogs  appear in the earliest inventories under many names of various spelling,  and were of many metals--copper, steel, iron, and brass. Sometimes a  fireplace had three sets of andirons of different sizes, to hold logs at  different heights. Cob irons had hooks to hold a spit and dripping-pan.  Sometimes the \"Handirons\" also had brackets. Creepers were low irons  placed between the great fire-dogs. They are mentioned in many early  wills and lists of possessions among items of fireplace furnishings, as,  for instance, the list of Captain Tyng's furniture, made in Boston in "]]]
