That you didn't mean  what you said a week ago.\"    \"I don't mean everything I say. How can a young girl do that? But I mean  what I say to you.\"    \"He told me you had forgotten me.\"    \"Ah no, I don't forget,\" said Pansy, showing her pretty teeth in a fixed  smile.    \"Then everything's just the very same?\"    \"Ah no, not the very same. Papa has been terribly severe.\"    \"What has he done to you?\"    \"He asked me what you had done to me, and I told him everything. Then he  forbade me to marry you.\"    \"You needn't mind that.\"    \"Oh yes, I must indeed. I can't disobey papa.\"    \"Not for one who loves you as I do, and whom you pretend to love?\"    She raised the lid of the tea-pot, gazing into this vessel for a moment;  then she dropped six words into its aromatic depths. \"I love you just as  much.\"    \"What good will that do me?\"    \"Ah,\" said Pansy, raising her sweet, vague eyes, \"I don't know that.\"    \"You disappoint me,\" groaned poor Rosier.    She was silent a little; she handed a tea-cup to a servant. \"Please  don't talk any more.\"    \"Is this to be all my satisfaction?\"    \"Papa said I was not to talk with you.\"    \"Do you sacrifice me like that? Ah, it's too much!\"    \"I wish you'd wait a little,\" said the girl in a voice just distinct  enough to betray a quaver.    \"Of course I'll wait if you'll give me hope. But you take my life away.\"    \"I'll not give you up--oh no!\" Pansy went on.    \"He'll try and make you marry some one else.\"    \"I'll never do that.\"    \"What then are we to wait for?\"    She hesitated again. \"I'll speak to Mrs. Osmond and she'll help us.\" It  was in this manner that she for the most part designated her stepmother.    \"She won't help us much. She's afraid.\"    \"Afraid of what?\"    \"Of your father, I suppose.\"    Pansy shook her little head. \"She's not afraid of any one. We must have  patience.\"    \"Ah, that's an awful word,\" Rosier groaned; he was deeply disconcerted.  Oblivious of the customs of good society, he dropped his head into his  hands and, supporting it with a melancholy grace, sat staring at the  carpet. Presently he became aware of a good deal of movement about  him and, as he looked up, saw Pansy making a curtsey--it was still her  little curtsey of the convent--to the English lord whom Mrs. Osmond had  introduced.          CHAPTER XXXIX    It will probably not surprise the reflective reader that Ralph Touchett  should have seen less of his cousin since her marriage than he had done  before that event--an event of which he took such a view as could hardly  prove a confirmation of intimacy. He had uttered his thought, as we  know, and after this had held his peace, Isabel not having invited him  to resume a discussion which marked an era in their relations. That  discussion had made a difference--the difference he feared rather than  the one he hoped. It had not chilled the girl's zeal in carrying out her  engagement, but it had come dangerously near to spoiling a friendship.  No reference was ever again made between them to Ralph's opinion of  Gilbert Osmond, and by surrounding this topic with a sacred silence they  managed to preserve a semblance of reciprocal frankness. But there was a  difference, as Ralph often said to himself--there was a difference. She  had not forgiven him, she never would forgive him: that was all he had  gained. She thought she had forgiven him; she believed she didn't care;  and as she was both very generous and very proud these convictions  represented a certain reality. But whether or no the event should  justify him he would virtually have done her a wrong, and the wrong was  of the sort that women remember best. As Osmond's wife she could never  again be his friend. If in this character she should enjoy the felicity  she expected, she would have nothing but contempt for the man who had  attempted, in advance, to undermine a blessing so dear; and if on the  other hand his warning should be justified the vow she had taken that he  should never know it would lay upon her spirit such a burden as to make  her hate him. So dismal had been, during the year that followed  his cousin's marriage, Ralph's prevision of the future; and if his  meditations appear morbid we must remember he was not in the bloom  of health. He consoled himself as he might by behaving (as he deemed)  beautifully, and was present at the ceremony by which Isabel was united  to Mr. Osmond, and which was performed in Florence in the month of  June. He learned from his mother that Isabel at first had thought of  celebrating her nuptials in her native land, but that as simplicity was  what she chiefly desired to secure she had finally decided, in spite  of Osmond's professed willingness to make a journey of any length, that  this characteristic would be best embodied in their being married by the  nearest clergyman in the shortest time. The thing was done therefore at  the little American chapel, on a very hot day, in the presence only of  Mrs. Touchett and her son, of Pansy Osmond and the Countess Gemini. That  severity in the proceedings of which I just spoke was in part the result  of the absence of two persons who might have been looked for on the  occasion and who would have lent it a certain richness. Madame Merle  had been invited, but Madame Merle, who was unable to leave Rome, had  written a gracious letter of excuses. Henrietta Stackpole had not been  invited, as her departure from America, announced to Isabel by Mr.  Goodwood, was in fact frustrated by the duties of her profession; but  she had sent a letter, less gracious than Madame Merle's, intimating  that, had she been able to cross the Atlantic, she would have been  present not only as a witness but as a critic. Her return to Europe had  taken place somewhat later, and she had effected a meeting with Isabel  in the autumn, in Paris, when she had indulged--perhaps a trifle too  freely--her critical genius. Poor Osmond, who was chiefly the subject  of it, had protested so sharply that Henrietta was obliged to declare to  Isabel that she had taken a step which put a barrier between them. \"It  isn't in the least that you've married--it is that you have married  HIM,\" she had deemed it her duty to remark; agreeing, it will be seen,  much more with Ralph Touchett than she suspected, though she had few of  his hesitations and compunctions. Henrietta's second visit to Europe,  however, was not apparently to have been made in vain; for just at the  moment when Osmond had declared to Isabel that he really must object to  that newspaper-woman, and Isabel had answered that it seemed to her he  took Henrietta too hard, the good Mr. Bantling had appeared upon  the scene and proposed that they should take a run down to Spain.  Henrietta's letters from Spain had proved the most acceptable she  had yet published, and there had been one in especial, dated from the  Alhambra and entitled 'Moors and Moonlight,' which generally passed for  her masterpiece. Isabel had been secretly disappointed at her husband's  not seeing his way simply to take the poor girl for funny. She even  wondered if his sense of fun, or of the funny--which would be his sense  of humour, wouldn't it?--were by chance defective. Of course she herself  looked at the matter as a person whose present happiness had nothing  to grudge to Henrietta's violated conscience. Osmond had thought their  alliance a kind of monstrosity; he couldn't imagine what they had in  common. For him, Mr. Bantling's fellow tourist was simply the most  vulgar of women, and he had also pronounced her the most abandoned.  Against this latter clause of the verdict Isabel had appealed with an  ardour that had made him wonder afresh at the oddity of some of his  wife's tastes. Isabel could explain it only by saying that she liked to  know people who were as different as possible from herself. \"Why  then don't you make the acquaintance of your washerwoman?\" Osmond  had enquired; to which Isabel had answered that she was afraid her  washerwoman wouldn't care for her. Now Henrietta cared so much.    Ralph had seen nothing of her for the greater part of the two years that  had followed her marriage; the winter that formed the beginning of her  residence in Rome he had spent again at San Remo, where he had been  joined in the spring by his mother, who afterwards had gone with him  to England, to see what they were doing at the bank--an operation she  couldn't induce him to perform. Ralph had taken a lease of his house at  San Remo, a small villa which he had occupied still another winter; but  late in the month of April of this second year he had come down to Rome.  It was the first time since her marriage that he had stood face to face  with Isabel; his desire to see her again was then of the keenest. She  had written to him from time to time, but her letters told him nothing  he wanted to know. He had asked his mother what she was making of her  life, and his mother had simply answered that she supposed she was  making the best of it. Mrs. Touchett had not the imagination that  communes with the unseen, and she now pretended to no intimacy with  her niece, whom she rarely encountered. This young woman appeared to  be living in a sufficiently honourable way, but Mrs. Touchett still  remained of the opinion that her marriage had been a shabby affair. It  had given her no pleasure to think of Isabel's establishment, which she  was sure was a very lame business. From time to time, in Florence, she  rubbed against the Countess Gemini, doing her best always to minimise  the contact; and the Countess reminded her "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28346"],[0,"Deathworld (#20)"],[1,"kill is their only logic. So they wouldn't  consider where to build their city, and managed to build it in the  stupidest spot imaginable. I'm sure my ancestors saw how foolish this  was and tried to tell them so. That would be reason enough for a war,  wouldn't it?\"    \"It might have been--if that's really what happened,\" Jason said. \"But I  think you have the problem turned backwards. It's a war between native  Pyrran life and humans, each fighting to destroy the other. The life  forms change continually, seeking that final destruction of the  invader.\"    \"Your theory is even wilder than mine,\" Rhes said. \"That's not true at  all. I admit that life isn't too easy on this planet ... if what I have  read in the books about other planets is true ... but it doesn't change.  You have to be fast on your feet and keep your eyes open for anything  bigger than you, but you can survive. Anyway, it doesn't really matter  why. The junkmen always look for trouble and I'm happy to see that they  have enough.\"    Jason didn't try to press the point. The effort of forcing Rhes to  change his basic attitudes wasn't worth it--even if possible. He hadn't  succeeded in convincing anyone in the city of the lethal mutations even  when they could observe all the facts. Rhes could still supply  information though.    [Illustration]    \"I suppose it's not important who started the battle,\" Jason said for  the other man's benefit, not meaning a word of it, \"but you'll have to  agree that the city people are permanently at war with all the local  life. Your people, though, have managed to befriend at least two species  that I have seen. Do you have any idea how this was done?\"    \"Naxa will be here in a minute,\" Rhes said, pointing to the door, \"as  soon as he's taken care of the animals. Ask him. He's the best talker we  have.\"    \"Talker?\" Jason asked. \"I had the opposite idea about him. He didn't  talk much, and what he did say was, well ... a little hard to understand  at times.\"    \"Not that kind of talking.\" Rhes broke in impatiently. \"The talkers look  after the animals. They train the dogs and doryms, and the better ones  like Naxa are always trying to work with other beasts. They dress  crudely, but they have to. I've heard them say that the animals don't  like chemicals, metal or tanned leather, so they wear untanned furs for  the most part. But don't let the dirt fool you, it has nothing to do  with his intelligence.\"    \"Doryms? Are those your carrying beasts--the kind we rode coming here?\"    Rhes nodded. \"Doryms are more than pack animals, they're really a little  bit of everything. The large males pull the ploughs and other machines,  while the younger animals are used for meat. If you want to know more,  ask Naxa, you'll find him in the barn.\"    \"I'd like to do that,\" Jason said, standing up. \"Only I feel undressed  without my gun--\"    \"Take it, by all means, it's in that chest by the door. Only watch out  what you shoot around here.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Naxa was in the rear of the barn, filing down one of the spadelike  toenails of a dorym. It was a strange scene. The fur-dressed man with  the great beast--and the contrast of a beryllium-copper file and  electroluminescent plates lighting the work.    The dorym opened its nostrils and pulled away when Jason entered; Naxa  patted its neck and talked softly until it quieted and stood still,  shivering slightly.    Something stirred in Jason's mind, with the feeling of a long unused  muscle being stressed. A hauntingly familiar sensation.    \"Good morning,\" Jason said. Naxa grunted something and went back to his  filing. Watching him for a few minutes, Jason tried to analyze this new  feeling. It itched and slipped aside when he reached for it, escaping  him. Whatever it was, it had started when Naxa had talked to the dorym.    \"Could you call one of the dogs in here, Naxa? I'd like to see one  closer up.\"    Without raising his head from his work, Naxa gave a low whistle. Jason  was sure it couldn't have been heard outside of the barn. Yet within a  minute one of the Pyrran dogs slipped quietly in. The talker rubbed the  beast's head, mumbling to it, while the animal looked intently into his  eyes.    The dog became restless when Naxa turned back to work on the dorym. It  prowled around the barn, sniffing, then moved quickly towards the open  door. Jason called it back.    At least he meant to call it. At the last moment he said nothing.  Nothing aloud. On sudden impulse he kept his mouth closed--only he  called the dog with his mind. Thinking the words _come here_, directing  the impulse at the animal with all the force and direction he had ever  used to manipulate dice. As he did it he realized it had been a long  time since he had even considered using his psi powers.    The dog stopped and turned back towards him.    It hesitated, looking at Naxa, then walked over to Jason.    Seen this closely the beast was a nightmare hound. The hairless  protective plates, tiny red-rimmed eyes, and countless, saliva-dripping  teeth did little to inspire confidence. Yet Jason felt no fear. There  was a rapport between man and animal that was understood. Without  conscious thought he reached out and scratched the dog along the back,  where he knew it itched.    \"Didn't know y're a talker,\" Naxa said. As he watched them, there was  friendship in his voice for the first time.    \"I didn't know either--until just now,\" Jason said. He looked into the  eyes of the animal before him, scratched the ridged and ugly back, and  began to understand.    The talkers must have well developed psi facilities, that was obvious  now. There is no barrier of race or alien form when two creatures share  each other's emotions. Empathy first, so there would be no hatred or  fear. After that direct communication. The talkers might have been the  ones who first broke through the barrier of hatred on Pyrrus and learned  to live with the native life. Others could have followed their  example--this might explain how the community of \"grubbers\" had been  formed.    Now that he was concentrating on it, Jason was aware of the soft flow  of thoughts around him. The consciousness of the dorym was matched by  other like patterns from the rear of the barn. He knew without going  outside that more of the big beasts were in the field back there.    \"This is all new to me,\" Jason said. \"Have you ever thought about it,  Naxa? What does it feel like to be a talker? I mean, do you _know_ why  it is you can get the animals to obey you while other people have no  luck at all?\"    Thinking of this sort troubled Naxa. He ran his fingers through his  thick hair and scowled as he answered. \"Nev'r thought about it. Just do  it. Just get t'know the beast real good, then y'can guess what they're  going t'do. That's all.\"    It was obvious that Naxa had never thought about the origin of his  ability to control the animals. And if he hadn't--probably no one else  had. They had no reason to. They simply accepted the powers of talkers  as one of the facts of life.    Ideas slipped towards each other in his mind, like the pieces of a  puzzle joining together. He had told Kerk that the native life of Pyrrus  had joined in battle against mankind, he didn't know why. Well--he still  didn't know why, but he was getting an idea of the \"how.\"    \"About how far are we from the city?\" Jason asked. \"Do you have an idea  how long it would take us to get there by dorym?\"    \"Half a day there--half back. Why? Y'want to go?\"    \"I don't want to get into the city, not yet. But I would like to get  close to it,\" Jason told him.    \"See what Rhes say,\" was Naxa's answer.           *       *       *       *       *    Rhes granted instant permission without asking any questions. They  saddled up and left at once, in order to complete the round trip before  dark.    They had been traveling less than an hour before Jason knew they were  going in the direction of the city. With each minute the feeling grew  stronger. Naxa was aware of it too, stirring in the saddle with unvoiced  feelings. They had to keep touching and reassuring their mounts which  were growing skittish and restless.    \"This is far enough,\" Jason said. Naxa gratefully pulled to a stop.    The wordless thought beat through Jason's mind, filling it. He could  feel it on all sides--only much stronger ahead of them in the direction  of the unseen city. Naxa and the doryms reacted in the same way,  restlessly uncomfortable, not knowing the cause.    One thing was obvious now. The Pyrran animals were sensitive to psi  radiation--probably the plants and lower life forms as well. Perhaps  they communicated by it, since they obeyed the men who had a strong  control of it. And in this area was a wash of psi radiation such as he  had never experienced before. Though his personal talents specialized in  psychokinesis--the mental control of inanimate matter--he was still  sensitive to most mental phenomena. Watching a sports event he had many  times felt the unanimous accord of many minds expressing the same  thought. What he felt now was like that.    Only terribly different. A crowd exulted at some success on the field,  or groaned at a failure. The feeling fluxed and changed as the game  progressed. Here the wash of thought was unending, strong and  frightening. It didn't translate into words very well. It was part  hatred, part fear--and all destruction.    \"_KILL THE ENEMY_\" was as close as Jason could express it. But it was  more than that. An unending river of mental outrage and death.    \"Let's go back now,\" he said, suddenly battered and sickened by the  feelings he had let wash through him. As they started the return trip he  began to understand many things.    His sudden unspeakable fear when the Pyrran animal had attacked him that  first day on the planet. And his recurrent nightmares that had never  completely ceased, even with drugs. Both of"]]]
