The letter said that the king could not comply with all  Lord Chelmsford's commands, as the arms taken from us at Isandula were  not brought to him, and that it was beyond his power as a king to order  or compel any of his regiments to lay down their arms.  He said the  cannons should be sent in, and on the receipt of the cattle and these  weapons the English must retire from Zululand.  The trader had written  in a corner of the letter, in pencil, a few words of warning, and an  intimation that Cetewayo had with him at Ulundi a picked force of 20,000  men.    Lord Chelmsford refused to receive the tusks, and told the messengers to  inform Cetewayo, that before he should think of retiring, all the  conditions must be complied with, and the Zulu regiments lay down their  arms.  Late in the evening several large bodies of the enemy, amounting  to some thousands, were noticed moving from the direction of Ulundi,  passing by their left flank.    The next morning General Wood moved forward as far as the left bank of  the White Umvolosi, and Newdigate's column followed in the afternoon.  Wood's division bivouacked on the farther side of the river, Newdigate's  halted on the right.  The most vigilant watch was kept, with pickets in  every direction, and patrols of cavalry beyond these.    At daybreak on the 27th the main body crossed the river, and joined Wood  on the left bank.  They were now but fifteen miles from Ulundi, and the  king's five kraals were visible to the naked eye.  Three days were given  to Cetewayo to comply with the conditions, but the original terms were  altered so far, that Lord Chelmsford consented to receive 1000 captured  rifles instead of insisting upon the regiments laying down their arms.  While waiting, the army remained on the Umvolosi, having retired to the  right side, pending the decision of peace or war.    During these three days the Zulus had made many hostile demonstrations  against us.  On the first and second they kept up a scattered fire at  distant ranges at our men, and on the third, growing bolder, pushed  their skirmishers down to the rocks on the opposite side of the river,  and fired upon the men, as they were watering their horses in the  stream.  One horse was killed and several men wounded.    Buller therefore asked and obtained permission to make a raid on the  other side.  A couple of guns were brought into requisition to defend  his crossing, and two or three rounds of shrapnel sent a crowd of Zulus,  who had approached the opposite heights, straggling in all directions.  Buller's horse, the mounted infantry, and Baker's horse dashed over the  river at once.  At full speed they raced across the country; Baker's  men, guided by their leader, inclined to the left front, by Buller's  orders, to carry and hold a hillock which commanded the ford.    Colonel Raaff, with a portion of Buller's horse, was halted near the  kraal of Unodwingo to act as a reserve, and Buller, with 100 of his best  mounted men, pushed on with the intention of exploring the ground as far  as possible towards Ulundi.  He knew that the bulk of the king's army  was away upon Lord Chelmsford's right flank, and thought therefore that  he might push on to Ulundi without opposition.  The country consisted of  a plain, across which ran some stony undulations, and at one point were  two hollows, united at a right angle.  The Zulu general disposed his men  in shelter, and as Buller with his little band of horsemen rode up they  rose and poured a very heavy fire into the ranks of the horsemen.  Sudden and unexpected as was this attack, Buller's men were too well  used to native fighting to evince the slightest confusion.  In the most  perfect order they began to fall back in alternate ranks, keeping up a  steady fire upon the enemy, who were eagerly advancing.  Raaff and his  men rode up to the assistance of the hotly-pressed party, and Baker's  horse, upon their hillock, opened a steady fire upon the Zulus.  Gradually and steadily the cavalry fell back towards the river, the two  guns on the opposite bank aiding them by their fire of grape and  shrapnel upon the Zulus, who pressed forward with extreme bravery.    Many gallant deeds were done.  Lord William Beresford, who had  accompanied the party as a volunteer, distinguished himself by his  bravery and coolness.  Seeing upon the ground a dismounted and wounded  trooper, surrounded by a dozen Zulus, he wheeled his horse and dashed  down among them, knocking over three with the rush of his horse, and  cutting down two with right and left strokes of his sabre; in another  moment he had the wounded man on his horse behind him, and carried him  off in safety.    Commander D'Arcy, also seeing a wounded man on the ground, tried to  carry him off, but his horse, being restive, reared and fell back upon  him, so that the unfortunate trooper was overtaken and assegaied; while  D'Arcy, who was severely bruised by falling on his revolver, was able to  get back safely, but was unable to take part in the next day's fight.    A little before daybreak Wood with his flying column crossed the river,  followed by the main army.  The whole of the baggage was left in charge  of the 24th, and nothing was taken, save the ammunition and water-carts,  each man carrying four days' supply of biscuits and preserved meat in  his haversack.  The crossing of the river was made without any  opposition, but the movements of the troops were watched by a party of  Zulus from a hillock on the left.    As soon as favourable ground had been reached, Wood was signalled to  halt and wait for the main body, and when the junction was effected the  order was given to form a large hollow square.  Inside this square were  two companies of engineers, together with the ammunition-carts,  water-carts, and ambulance waggons, carts with intrenching tools,  stretchers and bearers, together with two gatling-guns in a reserve.  The front face of the square was formed by the 80th Regiment, with two  gatling-guns in their centre and two 7-pounders on their right.  The  right face of the square was formed of seven companies of the 13th  Regiment.  Next to these came two 7-pounder and one 9-pounder guns; four  companies of the 58th completed the line on this side.  The rear face  was composed of two companies of the 21st, and three companies of the  94th, with a 9-pounder gun.  On the left or west flank were three  companies of the 94th, two 7-pounder guns, eight companies of the 90th,  and two 9-pounders.  Buller's cavalry were away, scouring the country on  the flanks.  Colonel Drury-Lowe, with two squadrons of the 17th Lancers  and Captain Shepstone's Basutos, formed the rearguard.  The square moved  forward for a few miles, when they began to near the smaller kraals.  Towards the left front the Zulu columns could now be seen across the  plain, with the sun glancing down upon their long lines of white  shields.  Upon reaching the first kraal the square was halted while it  was fired.  The next kraal was a very large one, called Unodwingo.  This  was also fired; but, as it was found that the smoke drifted across the  plain so as to act as a screen to the Zulus, Lord Chelmsford ordered its  extinction.  Strong columns of the enemy could now be seen moving out in  good order from Ulundi, and the square halted on some slightly-rising  ground.    The Zulus soon opened a dropping fire on the right front, and from a  strong force operating on some broken ground near Unodwingo on the left.  By nine o'clock the Zulu attack was fairly developed.  Buller's men  then made a strong demonstration on the left, driving the Zulus from the  hollow where they were sheltered back to the Unodwingo kraal.  This  movement was well supported by Shepstone and the Basutos.    The Zulus now brought up a strong reinforcement from the right, so as to  assist those engaged with the cavalry.  Buller's men fought in the Dutch  fashion, in two ranks; the first mounted and ready to dash in a moment  upon any weak point in the enemy's line, the second on foot, using their  saddles as a rest for their rifles.  As soon as the front rank became  too hardly pressed, they cantered to the rear and dismounted and opened  fire, while the second rank mounted in readiness to charge.  Gradually  Buller and Shepstone fell back, the Zulu column pressing upon them until  well within reach of the gatlings and Martinis.  The cavalry then took  refuge in the square, and over the ridges of the front and left the Zulu  column with loud shouts swept down upon the square.  The British  infantry now opened fire.  Gatlings and rifles poured in their deadly  hail of fire, while the guns swept the Zulu ranks with shrapnel and  grape.  Terrible as the fire was, the Zulus pressed bravely forward,  filling up the gaps made in their ranks, their wild war-cry rising even  above the roll of the rifle-fire.  The fiercest attack came from the  Unodwingo kraal.  Forming under cover of the kraal, a large body, led by  a chief on a white horse, and formed in a hollow square, dashed at the  right rear angle of the British formation.  Tremendous as the fire was,  they pressed forward until it seemed as if they would come to close  quarters with the column; but, brave as the Zulus were, it was  impossible to withstand the fire which the 21st, 94th, 58th, and Royal  Engineers poured into them.  The square was broken up, and after a  moment's pause the Zulus turned and sought shelter from the leaden hail.    While the fight was raging here, another Zulu column had attacked the  front; but here the assault was speedily repulsed, the cool and steady  fire of the 80th having so deadly an effect that the Zulus never  attempted to make a rush upon them.

It consists of  shoulder harness like that used on knapsacks, with two long straps and  buckles to pass around and secure any load. A tumpline is attached to  the top of the knapsack straps. I have carried in this contrivance over  a hundred pounds without discomfort. Suitable adjustment of the  headstrap will permit you to relieve alternately your neck and  shoulders. Heavy or rather compact articles can be included in the  straps, while the bulkier affairs will rest very well on top of the  pack. It is made by Abercrombie & Fitch, and costs two dollars and  seventy-five cents.
