He proposed to interdict all commerce with either of the  belligerents so long as both persisted in disregarding American rights,  while promising to raise the interdict in favour of the one which first  showed a disposition to treat the United States fairly. Such a policy  steadily pursued by such an America as we see to-day would probably have  succeeded. But at that time neither combatant was dependent upon  American products for the essentials of vitality. The suppression of the  American trade might cause widespread inconvenience, and even bring  individual merchants to ruin, but it could not hit the warring nations  hard enough to compel governments struggling on either side for their  very lives in a contest which seemed to hang on a hair to surrender  anything that might look like a military advantage. On the other hand,  the Embargo, as it was called, hit the Americans themselves very hard  indeed. So great was the outcry of the commercial classes, that the  President was compelled to retrace his steps and remove the interdict.  The problem he handed over unsolved to his successor.    That successor was James Madison, another Virginian, Jefferson's  lieutenant ever since the great struggle with the Federalists and his  intimate friend from a still earlier period. His talents as a writer  were great; he did not lack practical sagacity, and his opinions were  Jefferson's almost without a single point of divergence. But he lacked  Jefferson's personal prestige, and consequently the policy followed  during his Presidency was less markedly his own than that of his great  predecessor had been.    Another turn of the war-wheel in Europe had left America with only one  antagonist in place of two. Trafalgar had destroyed, once and for all,  the power of France on the sea, and she was now powerless to injure  American interests, did she wish to do so. England, on the other hand,  was stronger for that purpose than ever, and was less restrained than  ever in the exercise of her strength. A new dispute, especially  provocative to the feelings of Americans, had arisen over the question  of the impressment of seamen. The press-gang was active in England at  the time, and pursued its victims on the high seas. It even claimed the  right to search the ships of neutrals for fugitives. Many American  vessels were violated in this fashion, and it was claimed that some of  the men thus carried off to forced service, though originally English,  had become American citizens. England was clearly in the wrong, but she  refused all redress. One Minister, sent by us to Washington, Erskine,  did indeed almost bring matters to a satisfactory settlement, but his  momentary success only made the ultimate anger of America more bitter,  for he was disowned and recalled, and, as if in deliberate insult, was  replaced by a certain Jackson who, as England's Ambassador to Denmark in  1804, had borne a prominent part in the most sensational violation of  the rights of a neutral country that the Napoleonic struggle had  produced.    There seemed no chance of peace from any conciliatory action on the part  of Great Britain. The sole chance hung on the new President's  inheritance of Jefferson's strong leaning in that direction. But Madison  was by no means for peace at any price; and indeed Jefferson himself,  from his retreat at Monticello, hailed the war, when it ultimately came,  as unmistakably just. For a long time, however, the President alone held  the nation back from war. The War Party included the Vice-President  Munroe, who had been largely instrumental in bringing about the  Louisiana purchase. But its greatest strength was in the newly populated  West, and its chief spokesman in Congress was Henry Clay of Kentucky.    This man fills so large a space in American politics for a full  generation that some attempt must be made to give a picture of him. Yet  a just account of his character is not easy to give. It would be simple  enough to offer a superficial description, favourable or hostile, but  not one that would account for all his actions. Perhaps the best  analysis would begin by showing him as half the aboriginal Westerner and  half the Washington politician. In many ways he was very Western. He had  a Westerner's pugnacity, and at the same time a Westerner's geniality  and capacity for comradeship with men. He had to the last a Westerner's  private tastes--especially a taste for gambling--and a Westerner's  readiness to fight duels. Above all, from the time that he entered  Congress as the fiercest of the \"war hawks\" who clamoured for vengeance  on England, to the time when, an old and broken man, he expended the  last of his enormous physical energy in an attempt to bridge the  widening gulf between North and South, he showed through many grievous  faults and errors that intense national feeling and that passion for the  Union which were growing so vigorously in the fertile soil beyond the  Alleghanies. But he was a Western shoot early engrafted on the political  society of Washington--the most political of all cities, for it is a  political capital and nothing else. He entered Congress young and found  there exactly the atmosphere that suited his tastes and temperament. He  was as much the perfect parliamentarian as Gladstone. For how much his  tact and instinct for the tone of the political assembly in which he  moved counted may be guessed from this fact: that while there is no  speech of his that has come down to us that one could place for a  moment beside some of extant contemporary speeches of Webster and  Calhoun, yet it is unquestionable that he was considered fully a match  for either Webster or Calhoun in debate, and in fact attained an  ascendancy over Congress which neither of those great orators ever  possessed. At the management of the minds of men with whom he was  actually in contact he was unrivalled. No man was so skilful in  harmonizing apparently irreconcilable differences and choosing the exact  line of policy which opposing factions could agree to support. Three  times he rode what seemed the most devastating political storms, and  three times he imposed a peace. But with the strength of a great  parliamentarian he had much of the weakness that goes with it. He  thought too much as a professional; and in his own skilled work of  matching measures, arranging parties and moving politicians about like  pawns, he came more and more to forget the silent drive of the popular  will. All this, however, belongs to a later stage of Clay's development.  At the moment, we have to deal with him as the ablest of those who were  bent upon compelling the President to war.    Between Clay and the British Government Madison's hand was forced, and  war was declared. In America there were widespread rejoicings and high  hopes of the conquest of Canada and the final expulsion of England from  the New World. Yet the war, though on the whole justly entered upon, and  though popular with the greater part of the country, was not national in  the fullest sense. It did not unite, rather it dangerously divided, the  Federation, and that, unfortunately, on geographical lines. New England  from the first was against it, partly because most of her citizens  sympathized with Great Britain in her struggle with Napoleon, and partly  because her mercantile prosperity was certain to be hard hit, and might  easily be ruined by a war with the greatest of naval powers. When,  immediately after the declaration of war, in 1812, Madison was put  forward as Presidential candidate for a second term, the contest showed  sharply the line of demarcation. North-east of the Hudson he did not  receive a vote.    The war opened prosperously for the Republic, with the destruction by  Commander Perry of the British fleet on Lake Ontario--an incident which  still is held in glorious memory by the American Navy and the American  people. Following on this notable success, an invasion of Canada was  attempted; but here Fortune changed sides. The invasion was a complete  failure, the American army was beaten, forced to fall back, and  attacked, in its turn, upon American soil. Instead of American troops  occupying Quebec, English troops occupied a great part of Ohio.    Meanwhile, Jefferson's frigates were showing their metal. In many duels  with English cruisers they had the advantage, though we in this country  naturally hear most--indeed, it is almost the only incident of this war  of which we ever do hear--of one of the cases in which victory went the  other way--the famous fight between the _Shannon_ and the _Chesapeake_.  On the whole, the balance of such warfare leant in favour of the  American sea-captains. But it was not by such warfare that the issue  could be settled. England, summoning what strength she could spare from  her desperate struggle with the French Emperor, sent an adequate fleet  to convoy a formidable army to the American coast. It landed without  serious opposition at the mouth of the Chesapeake, and marched straight  on the national capital, which the Government was forced to abandon.    No Englishman can write without shame of what followed. All the public  buildings of Washington were deliberately burnt. For this outrage the  Home Government was solely responsible. The general in command received  direct and specific orders, which he obeyed unwillingly. No pretence of  military necessity, or even of military advantage, can be pleaded. The  act, besides being a gross violation of the law of nations, was an  exhibition of sheer brutal spite, such as civilized war seldom witnessed  until Prussia took a hand in it. It had its reward. It burnt deep into  the soul of America; and from that incident far more than from anything  that happened in the War of Independence dates that ineradicable hatred  of England which was for generations almost"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24063"],[0,"A Handbook of Some South Indian Grasses (#20)"],[1," cylindrical      silvery thyrsus                                    18.

The  inflorescences are terminal or axillary spiciform racemes. The  lowest-spikelet in the raceme is female and this is enclosed in a bract  which at length becomes hardened, polished and nut-like and the other  spikelets above it are male. The male spikelets are 2- to 3-nate at each  node of the rachis, 1 sessile and 1 or 2 pedicelled, lanceolate and  4-glumed. The first and the second glumes are subequal and empty, and  the first glume is winged along the inflated margins. The third and the  fourth glumes are hyaline, with three stamens or empty. The female  spikelet is ovoid acuminate and has four glumes. The first glume is  chartaceous and the others are thin and gradually smaller. The grain is  orbicular, ventrally furrowed and enclosed by the polished hard bract.      =Coix lachryma-jobi, _L._=    This is a tall monoecious leafy annual (rarely perennial) grass with  stout, smooth, polished, freely branching stems rooting at the lower  nodes and varying in length from 3 to 5 feet or more.    The _leaf-sheath_ is long, usually smooth but occasionally with  scattered tubercle-based hairs. The _ligule_ is a narrow membrane. The  _nodes_ are glabrous.    The _leaf-blade_ is long, flat, narrow or broad, acuminate, cordate at  base, with a stout midrib and many slender veins on both sides, usually  glabrous on both sides though occasionally with scattered hairs, and  with spinulosely serrate margins, varying from 4 to 18 inches in length  and 1/3 to 2 inches in breadth.    The _inflorescence_ consists of nodding or drooping spiciform racemes, 1  to 1-1/2 inches long, terminating the branches. The racemes consist of  many male spikelets with one (rarely two) female spikelets at the base;  the rachis is stout above, and the part within the bract enclosing the  female spikelet is slender.    The _male spikelets_ are imbricating, 2 or 3 at a node of the rachis,  one sessile and one or two pedicelled, dorsally compressed, articulate  at the base and persistent, very variable in size, 3/8 to 3/4 inch.  There are four _glumes_ in the spikelet. The _first glume_ is  oblong-lanceolate, chartaceous, 3/5 inch long, acute, many-nerved,  concave with inflexed margins bearing narrow green many-veined wings.  The _second glume_ is similar to the first, but thinner and without the  wings, 5- to 9- or rarely 11-nerved. The _third glume_ is  oblong-lanceolate, hyaline, faintly 3- to 5-nerved, paleate and with  three stamens. The _fourth glume_ is similar to the third, paleate with  or without stamens.

The  _first_ and the _second glumes_ are chartaceous. The _third_ and the  _fourth_ are hyaline, the former being empty and the latter with an  ovary. _Lodicules_ are not present. The _ovary_ is ovoid with very long  capillary styles. The grain is orbicular, compressed, channelled at the  back and enclosed within the stony, hardened and polished bract.    This grass usually grows in paddy fields. There are two distinct  varieties--one a fairly tall one annual and the other a very tall (5 to  10 feet) perennial one. The racemes of the latter are longer and  drooping, the male spikelets are in threes and the wings of the first  glume are usually broader than in the other form. This species is easily  recognized by the polished bract enclosing the female spikelet.    _Distribution._--Throughout India.        17. Polytoca, _Br._    These are tall monoecious annual or perennial grasses. Inflorescences  consist of spiciform racemes with spathaceous bracts; rachis is jointed.  Racemes may all be male or with one or two female spikelets at the base.  Male spikelets are geminate, one sessile and one pedicelled, 2-flowered  or imperfect, and with four glumes, which are subequal. The first glume  is membranous, many-nerved, shallowly concave and with a narrow  membranous margin. The second glume is narrower, ovate, acute, 5- to  9-nerved. The third glume is membranous, oblong, acute, 3- to 5-nerved,  paleate and with three stamens. The fourth glume is very slender,  hyaline, linear, paleate with three stamens or empty. Female spikelets  are broadly oblong, 1-flowered and with four glumes. The first glume is  thick, coriaceous and closely embraces the rachis of the spike by its  involute margin and the other glumes are within. The second glume is  oblong, many-nerved. The third is narrowly oblong, 3- to 5-nerved,  empty. The fourth glume is very narrow, truncate, 3-nerved, paleate.  Styles are very long with slender stigmas. Grain is small, fusiform,  terete and enclosed in the nut-like polished and hardened first glume.      =Polytoca barbata, _Stapf._=    This is an erect, tall, stout, freely branching, leafy, monoecious  perennial grass. The stems are terete, 3 to 6 feet high.    The _leaf-sheaths_ are long, glabrous, or with scattered tubercle-based  bristly hairs. The _ligule_ is a narrow membrane. The _nodes_ have a  ring of soft long hairs.    The _leaf-blades_ are long, flat, linear, acuminate, with a stout midrib  and thickened serrate margins, scabrid above and sometimes with a few  tubercle-based hairs, 10 inches to 2 feet long and 1/4 to 3/4 inch  broad.    The _inflorescence_ consists of paniculate spike-like racemes  terminating the branches and at first enclosed in spathiform bracts, the  lower and outer spathiform bracts are one inch or more in length with a  long awn at the tip, and the inner proper sheaths are oblong, awned and  about 1/2 inch long. The raceme consists of one or more female spikelets  at the base and a number of male spikelets above, appearing as if  sessile on the top of the female spikelet, but really articulate with  the internode below it which is enclosed by the first glume of the  female spikelet.    [Illustration: Fig. 127.--Polytoca barbata.    1.

The _first glume_ is concave, ovate, acute,  pubescent, herbaceous, many-nerved and with a narrow membranous margin  on one side only in the pedicelled and solitary spikelets and on both  sides in the sessile spikelets. The _second glume_ is narrower, dorsally  compressed, ovate, acuminate, 5- to 9-nerved, laterally compressed and  with a narrow wing to the keel near the apex in sessile spikelets and  dorsally compressed without the keel in the pedicelled and solitary  spikelets. The _third glume_ is membranous, oblong, acuminate, 3- to  5-nerved, with three stamens and paleate; the _palea_ is hyaline,  broadly linear. The _fourth glume_ is very slender, linear, hyaline,  with or without stamens, paleate; _palea_ is flat, narrowly linear.  _Lodicules_ are present"]]]
