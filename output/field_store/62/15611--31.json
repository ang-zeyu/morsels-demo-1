Cecil pulled Lucy back as she followed her mother.    \"Mrs. Honeychurch,\" he said, \"what if we two walk home and leave you?\"    \"Certainly!\" was her cordial reply.    Sir Harry likewise seemed almost too glad to get rid of them. He beamed  at them knowingly, said, \"Aha! young people, young people!\" and then  hastened to unlock the house.    \"Hopeless vulgarian!\" exclaimed Cecil, almost before they were out of  earshot.    \"Oh, Cecil!\"    \"I can't help it. It would be wrong not to loathe that man.\"    \"He isn't clever, but really he is nice.\"    \"No, Lucy, he stands for all that is bad in country life. In London he  would keep his place. He would belong to a brainless club, and his wife  would give brainless dinner parties. But down here he acts the little  god with his gentility, and his patronage, and his sham aesthetics, and  everyone--even your mother--is taken in.\"    \"All that you say is quite true,\" said Lucy, though she felt  discouraged. \"I wonder whether--whether it matters so very much.\"    \"It matters supremely. Sir Harry is the essence of that garden-party.  Oh, goodness, how cross I feel! How I do hope he'll get some vulgar  tenant in that villa--some woman so really vulgar that he'll notice  it. GENTLEFOLKS! Ugh! with his bald head and retreating chin! But let's  forget him.\"    This Lucy was glad enough to do. If Cecil disliked Sir Harry Otway and  Mr. Beebe, what guarantee was there that the people who really mattered  to her would escape? For instance, Freddy. Freddy was neither clever,  nor subtle, nor beautiful, and what prevented Cecil from saying, any  minute, \"It would be wrong not to loathe Freddy\"? And what would she  reply? Further than Freddy she did not go, but he gave her anxiety  enough. She could only assure herself that Cecil had known Freddy some  time, and that they had always got on pleasantly, except, perhaps,  during the last few days, which was an accident, perhaps.    \"Which way shall we go?\" she asked him.    Nature--simplest of topics, she thought--was around them. Summer Street  lay deep in the woods, and she had stopped where a footpath diverged  from the highroad.    \"Are there two ways?\"    \"Perhaps the road is more sensible, as we're got up smart.\"    \"I'd rather go through the wood,\" said Cecil, With that subdued  irritation that she had noticed in him all the afternoon. \"Why is it,  Lucy, that you always say the road? Do you know that you have never once  been with me in the fields or the wood since we were engaged?\"    \"Haven't I? The wood, then,\" said Lucy, startled at his queerness, but  pretty sure that he would explain later; it was not his habit to leave  her in doubt as to his meaning.    She led the way into the whispering pines, and sure enough he did  explain before they had gone a dozen yards.    \"I had got an idea--I dare say wrongly--that you feel more at home with  me in a room.\"    \"A room?\" she echoed, hopelessly bewildered.    \"Yes. Or, at the most, in a garden, or on a road. Never in the real  country like this.\"    \"Oh, Cecil, whatever do you mean? I have never felt anything of the  sort. You talk as if I was a kind of poetess sort of person.\"    \"I don't know that you aren't. I connect you with a view--a certain type  of view. Why shouldn't you connect me with a room?\"    She reflected a moment, and then said, laughing:    \"Do you know that you're right? I do. I must be a poetess after all.  When I think of you it's always as in a room. How funny!\"    To her surprise, he seemed annoyed.    \"A drawing-room, pray? With no view?\"    \"Yes, with no view, I fancy. Why not?\"    \"I'd rather,\" he said reproachfully, \"that you connected me with the open  air.\"    She said again, \"Oh, Cecil, whatever do you mean?\"    As no explanation was forthcoming, she shook off the subject as too  difficult for a girl, and led him further into the wood, pausing every  now and then at some particularly beautiful or familiar combination of  the trees. She had known the wood between Summer Street and Windy Corner  ever since she could walk alone; she had played at losing Freddy in it,  when Freddy was a purple-faced baby; and though she had been to Italy,  it had lost none of its charm.    Presently they came to a little clearing among the pines--another tiny  green alp, solitary this time, and holding in its bosom a shallow pool.    She exclaimed, \"The Sacred Lake!\"    \"Why do you call it that?\"    \"I can't remember why. I suppose it comes out of some book. It's only a  puddle now, but you see that stream going through it? Well, a good deal  of water comes down after heavy rains, and can't get away at once, and  the pool becomes quite large and beautiful. Then Freddy used to bathe  there. He is very fond of it.\"    \"And you?\"    He meant, \"Are you fond of it?\" But she answered dreamily, \"I bathed  here, too, till I was found out. Then there was a row.\"    At another time he might have been shocked, for he had depths of  prudishness within him. But now? with his momentary cult of the fresh  air, he was delighted at her admirable simplicity. He looked at her as  she stood by the pool's edge. She was got up smart, as she phrased it,  and she reminded him of some brilliant flower that has no leaves of its  own, but blooms abruptly out of a world of green.    \"Who found you out?\"    \"Charlotte,\" she murmured. \"She was stopping with us.  Charlotte--Charlotte.\"    \"Poor girl!\"    She smiled gravely. A certain scheme, from which hitherto he had shrunk,  now appeared practical.    \"Lucy!\"    \"Yes, I suppose we ought to be going,\" was her reply.    \"Lucy, I want to ask something of you that I have never asked before.\"    At the serious note in his voice she stepped frankly and kindly towards  him.    \"What, Cecil?\"    \"Hitherto never--not even that day on the lawn when you agreed to marry  me--\"    He became self-conscious and kept glancing round to see if they were  observed. His courage had gone.    \"Yes?\"    \"Up to now I have never kissed you.\"    She was as scarlet as if he had put the thing most indelicately.    \"No--more you have,\" she stammered.    \"Then I ask you--may I now?\"    \"Of course, you may, Cecil. You might before. I can't run at you, you  know.\"    At that supreme moment he was conscious of nothing but absurdities. Her  reply was inadequate. She gave such a business-like lift to her veil.  As he approached her he found time to wish that he could recoil. As  he touched her, his gold pince-nez became dislodged and was flattened  between them.    Such was the embrace. He considered, with truth, that it had been a  failure. Passion should believe itself irresistible. It should forget  civility and consideration and all the other curses of a refined nature.  Above all, it should never ask for leave where there is a right of way.  Why could he not do as any labourer or navvy--nay, as any young man  behind the counter would have done? He recast the scene. Lucy was  standing flowerlike by the water, he rushed up and took her in his  arms; she rebuked him, permitted him and revered him ever after for his  manliness. For he believed that women revere men for their manliness.    They left the pool in silence, after this one salutation. He waited for  her to make some remark which should show him her inmost thoughts. At  last she spoke, and with fitting gravity.    \"Emerson was the name, not Harris.\"    \"What name?\"    \"The old man's.\"    \"What old man?\"    \"That old man I told you about. The one Mr. Eager was so unkind to.\"    He could not know that this was the most intimate conversation they had  ever had.        Chapter X: Cecil as a Humourist    The society out of which Cecil proposed to rescue Lucy was perhaps no  very splendid affair, yet it was more splendid than her antecedents  entitled her to. Her father, a prosperous local solicitor, had built  Windy Corner, as a speculation at the time the district was opening up,  and, falling in love with his own creation, had ended by living there  himself. Soon after his marriage the social atmosphere began to alter.  Other houses were built on the brow of that steep southern slope and  others, again, among the pine-trees behind, and northward on the chalk  barrier of the downs. Most of these houses were larger than Windy  Corner, and were filled by people who came, not from the district, but  from London, and who mistook the Honeychurches for the remnants of an  indigenous aristocracy. He was inclined to be frightened, but his wife  accepted the situation without either pride or humility. \"I cannot think  what people are doing,\" she would say, \"but it is extremely fortunate  for the children.\" She called everywhere; her calls were returned with  enthusiasm, and by the time people found out that she was not exactly  of their milieu, they liked her, and it did not seem to matter. When Mr.  Honeychurch died, he had the satisfaction--which few honest solicitors  despise--of leaving his family rooted in the best society obtainable.    The best obtainable. Certainly many of the immigrants were rather  dull, and Lucy realized this more vividly since her return from Italy.  Hitherto she had accepted their ideals without questioning--their kindly  affluence, their inexplosive religion, their dislike of paper-bags,  orange-peel, and broken bottles. A Radical out and out, she learnt to  speak with horror of Suburbia. Life, so far as she troubled to conceive  it, was a circle of rich, pleasant people, with identical interests and  identical foes. In this circle, one thought, married, and died. Outside  it were poverty and vulgarity for ever trying to enter, just as the  London fog tries to enter the pine-woods pouring through the gaps in  the northern hills. But, in Italy, where any one who chooses may warm  himself in equality, as in the sun, this conception of life vanished.  Her senses expanded; she felt that there"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26457"],[0,"New observations on the natural history of bees (#20)"],[1,"of swarming is so great, that all the  bees participate in it, and leave the hive, the desertion lasts but for  a moment. The hive throws only during the finest part of the day, and it  is then that the bees are ranging through the country. Those that are  out, therefore, cannot share in the agitation; when returned to the  hive, they quietly resume their labours; and their number is not small,  for, when the weather is fine, at least a third of the bees are employed  in the fields at once.    Even in the most embarrassing case, namely, where the whole bees desert  the hive, it does not follow, that all those endeavouring to depart  become members of the new colony. When this agitation or delirium seizes  them, the whole rush forward and accumulate towards the entrance of the  hive, and are heated in such a manner that they perspire copiously.  Those near the bottom, and supporting the weight of all the rest, seem  drenched in perspiration; their wings grow moist; they are incapable of  flight; and even when able to escape, they advance no farther than the  board of the hive, and soon return.    Those that have lately left their cells remain behind the swarm, still  feeble, they could not support themselves in flight. Here then are also  many recruits to people what we should have thought a deserted  habitation.          LETTER X.    _THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED._      To preserve greater regularity in continuing the history of swarms, I  think it proper to recapitulate in a few words the principal points of  the preceding letter, and to expatiate on each, concerning the result of  new experiments, respecting which I have still been silent.    In the first place. _If at the return of spring, we examine a hive well  peopled, and governed by a fertile queen, we shall see her lay a  prodigious number of male eggs in the course of May, and the workers  will chuse that moment for constructing several royal cells of the kind  described by M. de Reaumur._ Such is the result of several long  continued observations, among which there has not been the slightest  variation, and I cannot hesitate in announcing it as demonstrated.  However, I should here add the necessary explanation. It is necessary  that the queen, before commencing her _great_ laying of the eggs of  males, be eleven months old; when young she lays only those of workers.  A queen, hatched in spring, will perhaps lay fifty or sixty eggs of  drones in whole, but before beginning her great laying of them, which  should be two thousand in a month, she must have completed her eleventh  month in age. In the course of our experiments, which more or less  disturbed the natural state of things, it often happened that the queen  did not attain this age until October, and immediately began laying male  eggs. The workers, as if induced by some emanation from the eggs, also  adopted this time for building the royal cells. No swarm resulted  thence, it is true, because in autumn all the necessary circumstances  are absolutely wanting, but it is not less evident, that there is a  secret relation between the production of the eggs of males, and the  construction of royal cells.    This laying commonly continues thirty days. The bees on the twentieth or  twenty-first lay the foundation of several royal cells. Sometimes they  build sixteen or twenty; we have even had twenty-seven. When the cells  are three or four lines high, the queen lays those eggs from which her  own species will come, but not the whole in one day. That the hive may  throw several swarms, it is essential that the young females conducting  them be not all produced at the same time. One may affirm, that the  queen anticipates the fact, for she takes care to allow at least the  interval of a day between every egg deposited in the cells. It is proved  by the bees knowing to close the cells the moment the worms are ready to  metamorphose to nymphs. Now, as they close all the royal cells at  different periods, it is evident the included worms are not all of an  equal age.    The queen's belly is very turgid before she begins laying the eggs of  drones; but it sensibly decreases as she advances, and when terminated  is very small. Thus she finds herself in a condition to undertake a  journey which circumstances may prolong; thus this condition was  necessary; and as every thing is harmonious in the laws of nature, the  origin of the males corresponds with that of the females, which they are  to fecundate.    Secondly. _When the larvae hatched from the eggs laid by the queen, in  the royal cells, are ready to transform to nymphs, this queen leaves the  swarm conducting a swarm along with her; and the first swarm that  proceeds from the hive is uniformly conducted by the old queen._{M} I  think I can divine the reason of it.    That there may never be a plurality of females in a hive, nature has  inspired queens with a natural horror against each other; they never  meet without endeavouring to fight, and to accomplish their mutual  destruction. Thus, the chance of combat is equal between them, and  fortune will decide to which the empire shall pertain. But if one  combatant is older than the rest, she is stronger, and the advantage  will be with her. She will destroy her rivals successively as produced.  Thus, if the old queen did not leave the hive, when the young ones  undergo their last metamorphosis, it could produce no more swarms, and  the species would perish. Therefore, to preserve the species, it is  necessary that the old queen conduct the first swarm. But what is the  secret means employed by nature to induce her departure? I am ignorant  of it.    In this country it is very rare, though not without example, for the  swarm, led forth by the old queen, in three weeks to produce a new  colony, which is also conducted by the same old queen; and that may  happen thus. Nature has not willed that the queen shall quit the first  hive before her production of male eggs is finished. It is necessary for  her to be freed of them, that she may become lighter. Besides, if her  first occupation, on entering a new dwelling, was laying more male eggs,  still she might perish either from age or accident before depositing  those of workers. The bees in that case would have no means of replacing  her, and the colony would go to ruin.    All these things have been with infinite wisdom foreseen. The first  operation of the bees of a swarm is to construct the cells of workers.  They labour at them with great ardour, and as the ovaries of the queen  have been disposed with admirable foresight, the first eggs she has to  lay in her new abode are those of workers. Commonly her laying  continues ten or eleven days; and at this time portions of comb  containing large cells are fabricated. It may be affirmed, that the bees  know their queen will also lay the eggs of drones; she actually does  begin to deposit some, though in much smaller number than at first;  enough however to encourage the bees to construct royal cells. Now, if  in these circumstances the weather is favourable, it is not impossible  that a second colony may be formed, and that the queen may depart at the  head of it within three weeks of conducting the first swarm. But I  repeat, the fact is rare in our climate. Let me now return to the hives  from which the queen has led the first colony.    Thirdly. _After the old queen has conducted the first swarm from the  hive, the remaining bees take particular care of the royal cells, and  prevent the young queens successively hatched from leaving them, unless  at an interval of several days between each._    In the preceding letter, I have given you the detail and proof of this  fact, and I shall here add some reflexions. During the period of  swarming, the conduct or instinct of bees seems to receive a particular  modification. At all other times, when they have lost their queen, they  appropriate workers worms to replace her; they prolong and enlarge the  cells of these worms; they supply them with aliment more abundantly, and  of a more pungent taste; and by this alteration, the worms that would  have changed to common bees are transformed to queens. We have seen  twenty-seven cells of this kind constructed at once; but when finished  the bees no longer endeavour to preserve the young females from the  attacks of their enemies. One may perhaps leave her cell, and attack all  the other royal cells successively, which she will tear open to destroy  her rivals, without the workers taking any part in their defence. Should  several queens be hatched at once, they will pursue each other, and  fight until the throne remain with her that is victorious. Far from  opposing such duels, the other bees rather seem to excite the  combatants.    Things are quite reversed during the period of swarming. The royal cells  then constructed are of a different figure from the former. They  resemble stalactites, and in the beginning are like the cup of an acorn.  The bees assiduously guard the cells when the young queens are ready for  their last metamorphosis. At length the female hatched from the first  egg laid by the old queen leaves her cell; the workers at first treat  her with indifference. But she, immediately yielding to the instinct  which urges her to destroy her rivals, seeks the cells where they are  enclosed; yet no sooner does she approach than the bees bite, pull, and  drive her away, so that she is forced to remove; but the royal cells  being numerous, scarce can she find a place of rest. Incessantly  harassed with the desire of attacking the other queens, and incessantly  repelled, she becomes agitated, and hastily traverses the different  groupes of workers, to which she communicates her agitation. At this  moment numbers of bees rush towards the aperture of the hive, and, with  the young queen at their head, depart to seek another habitation.    After the departure of the colony, the remaining workers"]]]
