How justly has the prophet Isaiah compared the church to a  solitary cottage in a vineyard, and to a wasted city! Isa. 1:8. \"Woe is  me!\" exclaims Micah, \"I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits,  as the grape-gleanings of the vintage: there is no cluster to eat: my soul  desires the first ripe fruit. The good man is perished out of the earth;  and there is none upright among men.\" Micah 7:1, 2. See also Ps. 74:19;  102:7.    5. God alone knows where and who these are: but be they where and who they  may, assuredly Christ is with them, yea, in them, \"alway, even unto the  end of the world.\" Matt. 28:20. Nor will he ever leave them without  sufficient succor; \"I will not leave you comfortless,\" he says; \"I will  come unto you.\" John 14:18. For he knoweth them that are his, and those  whom he is said to _know_, he watches over with never-ceasing and  distinguishing care. \"The foundation of God standeth sure, having this  seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his.\" But who _are his_? The answer  is immediately annexed: \"Let every one that nameth the name of Christ  depart from iniquity.\" 2 Tim. 2:19. But let those who are not disposed to  obey this injunction, assume some _other_ name that shall better accord  with their conduct; and let them not name _His_ name, until they conform  to His life by a living faith.          Chapter XI.      Showing That He Does Not Truly Repent, Is Not A Christian, And Not A Child    Of God, Who Does Not, In _His Life And Conduct_, Follow Christ; Also,            Wherein The New Birth And The Yoke Of Christ Consist.          _Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye      should follow his steps._--1 PET. 2:21.      God has appointed our Lord Jesus Christ to be our prophet or teacher; and,  by a voice from heaven, has commanded us to hear him; saying, \"This is my  beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased: hear ye him.\" Matt. 17:5. This  office was most faithfully executed by the Son of God, not only in words,  but (as became a teacher engaged in so sacred a function) by a most holy  and unblemished life. In allusion to this, St. Luke thus prefaces his  account of the Acts of the Apostles: \"The former treatise have I made, O  Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to _do_ and teach, etc.\"; where,  it is to be remarked, that he places _doing_ before _teaching_; intimating  that these ought never to be separated. It certainly is the duty of every  true teacher, first, to practise himself the duties which he purposes to  teach others. Such a teacher was our Lord Jesus; and his conduct is the  pattern of teaching, and the book of life which we ought to study.    2. It was for this cause, that the Son of God became man, and conversed  with men upon earth, that he might give us a visible example of an  innocent, perfect, and divine life; and that we might follow him as a  light that shineth in darkness, to lead us in the way in which we should  go. Hence he calls himself \"the light of the world;\" and promises that \"he  who followeth him shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of  life.\" John 8:12.    3. Hence it clearly appears, that they who refuse to follow Christ in his  life, and to tread by faith in his steps, remain in darkness, and are not  in the way to obtain \"the light of life.\" But what is this _darkness_? It  is an impenitent and depraved life, called by the apostle \"works of  darkness,\" which are to be cast off, that so we may put on \"the armor of  light\" (Rom. 13:12); and in genuine repentance both these duties are  comprised.    4. It has been abundantly proved above, that godly sorrow and true faith  thoroughly change a man; that they crucify the flesh, effect an entire  transformation in the soul, and beget, through the Holy Ghost, a new life.  Lest, however, this should be a mere theoretical knowledge, devoid of life  and practice, God has been pleased to set before us his own Son, not only  as a ransom and a Mediator, but also as a _mirror_ of perfect godliness,  and as a most finished pattern of the new man, who is regenerated after  the image of God. In him, the fleshly Adam, the corrupt nature, never  reigned; but the blessed God alone. Him it hath pleased God to set forth  before our eyes, that, contemplating him and his righteous life, we might  be daily more and more renewed after his image. Let us explain this point  more fully.    5. Sad experience teaches us continually, that our whole nature, body and  soul, is polluted with every kind of sin, vice, and corruption. These are  the works of the devil appearing in the carnal man; and it is principally  in the depraved and perverted _will_, that these diabolical operations are  most visibly discerned. For the depraved will is the root of all sin: if  that were removed, there would be sin no more. With regard to the power  and natural bias of this will, it consists chiefly in turning man away  from God and from _His_ will. Now, whatever departs from that Being who is  the sovereign and supreme Good, cannot but be in itself evil; for it  partakes of the nature of the supreme evil, and is a violation of the  original constitution of our nature, as derived from God himself. It was  this _turning away_ from God that produced the fall both of Satan and of  man; whence sin entered into the world, and has, by fleshly generation,  passed upon all men.    6. The nature of man is then inoculated with the nature of the devil  himself, and his will tainted with satanical wickedness, as with deadly  poison. Hence Christ called the Pharisees \"children of the devil\" (John  8:44); and even to one of his own disciples gave the name of Satan (John  6:70); intimating as though the covetousness, lying, pride, and evil  concupiscence, by which the nature of all men is defiled, were Satan  himself.    7. Hence it may, with all propriety, be affirmed, that they who lead a  life void of repentance, a life of pride, avarice, lust, and envy, live in  the devil, and partake of his nature. Such persons may assume the garb of  honesty; they may veil their real characters under a fair show of morality  and correct deportment; yet, _inwardly_, according to the saying of Christ  to the Jews, they are, nevertheless, devils. John 8:44. Such a declaration  is dreadful to be made; but the truth of it is confirmed, both by the Word  of God and by continual experience.    8. Our nature, as fallen creatures, being thus miserably depraved, thus  desperately perverted, and vitiated in all its springs; there is an  absolute necessity that it should be purified and _renewed_. There must be  a _total renovation_ of the soul, in all its powers and all its faculties.  But how shall this be effected? We answer: As the _chief evil_ has made a  breach upon our nature, and has infused poison into its very springs; so  must the _chief Good_ revisit and renew our nature, that it may be  assimilated to itself. That which the supreme evil has so radically  corrupted, can be corrected only by a thorough and vital _penetration_ of  the supreme Good, even of God himself; and, therefore, it was necessary  that the Word should be made flesh.    9. The Son of God truly became man, not for his own sake, but for our  sakes; that, by reconciling us to God by himself, he might make us  partakers of the sovereign good, having cleansed and sanctified us, to  that end; for whatever is to be sanctified, must be sanctified by God and  with God. And as God is in Christ, so ought we to be united to him by  faith, that we may live in God, and God in us; we in Christ, and Christ in  us (2 Cor. 5:19, 21); that the will of God be in us, and we in the will of  God, being made the righteousness of God in Christ. 2 Cor. 5:21. This is  the only way in which Christ administers medicine to our corrupt nature;  and the more powerfully he influences man, the more thoroughly will human  nature be purified.    10. Oh! how blessed is the man in whom Christ does all and is all; whose  will, thoughts, mind, and words, are the will, thoughts, mind, and words  of Christ! It was thus the apostle said, \"We have the mind of Christ.\" 1  Cor. 2:16. And so indeed it must be with the believer; because the life of  Christ is the new life, yea, the new man in him; and whoever lives in  Christ after the Spirit, hath really put on the new man, and all the  graces with which he is adorned. His meekness and obedience are the  meekness and obedience of Christ; his patience and humility are the  patience and humility of Christ; and his life itself is the life of  Christ, by whom and in whom he lives. This is the \"new creature\" which is  created after God (2 Cor. 5:17); and that life of Christ in us, of which  St. Paul experimentally says, \"I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in  me.\" Gal. 2:20. This is to follow Christ truly. This is to walk in the  light of his life, and to bring forth \"fruits meet for repentance;\" for,  by this means, the \"old man\" is destroyed, the carnal life gradually  declines, and the new and divine life is established in the soul. He who  has this life is not a _nominal_, but a _real_ Christian; a Christian not  in word and in appearance only, but in deed and in truth. He is a true  child of God, begotten of Him, and quickened and renewed by faith after  the image of Jesus Christ.    11. Although we cannot attain to a state of perfection, while encompassed  with so many infirmities that obstruct our progress in the divine life, we  ought not, therefore, to be discouraged, but rather to be inspired with  more fervor in seeking after a consummation so much to be desired. We  ought ardently to wish and pray, to endeavor and study, that the kingdom  of Christ be established within us, and the kingdom of Satan destroyed. 1  John 3:9; Eph. 2:5. The object of our cares and efforts, of our groans and  prayers, should be--how we may more and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34781"],[0,"An Australian Bird Book: A Pocket Book for Field Use (#20)"],[1,"is  a rare bird, and may readily be distinguished by its smaller size and  more glossy plumage.    The peculiar gray Gang-gang Cockatoos are common in parts of the  forest country. The male is easily recognized by his red head and  crest. I occasionally see these interesting birds in the big eucalypt  forests of Gippsland. I was surprised to discover that, in South  Gippsland, it is generally called the Galah, a name which belongs to  quite a different bird (194).    The screeching, fussy White Cockatoo, with its delicate sulphur crest,  is well known. Many country dwellers enjoy the privilege of often  seeing these snowy-white birds almost covering a dead tree. They  are favorites as pets, and live to a good old age. They render good  service at times by digging up and eating grasshoppers' eggs, though  they do damage to maize and other crops. As they post sentinels, they  are difficult birds to approach.    The Pink Cockatoo (Major Mitchell) is unfortunately becoming rare. It  was fairly common when I taught in a Mallee school, near where Hopetoun  now is. It has been described as \"quite the most beautiful of all the  Cockatoos, being a harmony of delicate rose-pink and white, with a  handsome crest of acuminate feathers barred in crimson, yellow, and  white.\" It does not take kindly to captivity. It nested in the smaller  \"spouts\" of the green \"box-trees\" in the \"box-flats\" and swamps about  the Goyura School, south of Lake Corrong.    What is more glorious than a mob of Rose-breasted Cockatoos  (Galahs), 500 strong, airing their beauties and graces as they take a  constitutional before retiring for the night? Probably no other kind  of bird shows better company-flying than Galahs; now one sheet of  a delicate gray lavender, and the next instant a flash of brilliant  salmon-pink, as the whole company turns and wheels, obedient to some  command or signal unperceived by us; again, the sun lights up the  pale-pink crests and gray backs, as they turn once more and wheel,  screeching, to continue their evolutions further afield. It is a sight  that lingers in the memory. They are charming pets, and some talk  well. Their beauty adds charm to our almost perfectly level great  inland plains.    The delicately-colored and friendly Cockatoo Parrot, with its  immovable crest, takes a sub-family to itself. It migrates from the  North, and, in a dry year, may even reach the South Coast. In 1908  some of these birds reached Colac, in Southern Victoria. They are  favorite aviary birds, and thousands have been exported.    In the true Parrot family, Australia is strongly represented by many  beautiful birds. The first is the Barraband Parrakeet of Gould, and  the Green Leek of some ornithologists. As the name Green Leek is  practically in universal use for the Musk Lorikeet (Green Keet) of the  ornithologist, it seems desirable to sink an inappropriate name into  a synonym, and use the earlier name, Superb Parrot, for it is a  beautiful bird. Sad to say, it has become exceedingly rare, though Mr.  A. W. Milligan informed me, a few days ago, that he saw six fly into  some pines at Black Rock one day this month (January, 1911).    The Rock Pebble, or Smoker, of the country dweller, formally called  the Black-tailed Parrot, is a fine bird. His tail, however, is not  really black, but is strongly iridescent. He nested in numbers, at  the beginning of the nineties, in the dead box-trees in Lake Corrong.  After an early tea, we frequently went over to the lake and watched  the birds feeding their young. No longer do they inhabit that  district, which has been completely cleared and placed under  cultivation.    The big King Parrot is a \"showy, noble species,\" and is still common  in parts, especially the moist forest districts.    The members of the next group form a sub-family--the  Broad-tails--confined to Australia, Tasmania, New Zealand, and the  Pacific Islands. Judging by their names, they must be amongst the most  beautiful of birds. The best known is the common Rosella, often  quoted in European books as one of the most beautiful of birds.  Its scientific name is eximius, which means excellent. Indeed, the  scientific names of Australian parrots give a good indication of  their place amongst the glories of the bird world. The cousin of the  Rosella--the large blue-winged and blue-cheeked Crimson Parrot--is  well named elegans; a grass parrot is also elegans, then follow  splendidus, splendida, and pulchella, while that great ornithologist,  Gould, has conferred the honor of pulcherrimus on another Australian  parrot. These names, given by scientists, will show Australians in  what high esteem these birds, so common with us, are held by observers  from other lands.    The Crimson Parrot, previously mentioned, is, I think, becoming  common, for I have lately seen it flying about in towns, notably in  the Botanic Gardens, Melbourne, the Zoological Gardens, Melbourne, and  the school yard at Wangaratta.    The Yellow Parrakeet, with its blue cheeks, is a \"harmony in blue and  canary yellow, and is an exceedingly lovely bird.\" It is unfortunately  rare.    The next bird is one of our well-known cage pets--the beautiful  Ringneck--the Mallee Parrot. It flies ahead of one along the  half-chain strip of scrub left on mallee roads, and is a feature of  interest.    The next group contains some inland parrots. The \"Bulloak,\" or \"Blue  Bonnet,\" is a beautiful bird, and is common on inland plains. It has  a brownish-olive back and a gray chest. The bright, blue cheeks,  forehead, and shoulder, red abdomen, and light yellow base to tail  present a striking appearance. Its vernacular name--Yellow-vented  Parrakeet--has now been altered to Blue Bonnet Parrot.    The Many-colored Parrot, with its large yellow shoulder patch, is a  glory. It is, indeed, difficult to imagine a more beautiful bird as  it flies about in the bright Mallee sunshine. The Red-backed Parrot is  the common \"Grass Parrot\" of country dwellers. Large flocks of these  birds are to be seen on the inland plains. The female is much plainer  than her gaudy mate. This is unusual amongst parrots; for, as the work  of sitting on the eggs is done in a hollow tree under good shelter,  there is apparently no reason why the female should be plainer than  the male, and in most parrots she is equally pretty.    The brownish female offers a strong contrast to her more brightly  coloured mate, which is immediately distinguished by the large red  patch on the back. (The Many-colored Parrot has a much smaller red  patch on the back, near the base of the tail.)    The seven small Grass-Parrots (_Neophemas_) are amongst the most  beautiful of parrots. These birds have become so rare that the South  Australian Government has wisely placed them on the totally-protected  list. Bird trappers formerly exported numbers to Europe each year.  These rare Parrots are said to be worth about L7 each as cage birds.    We found the rare Rock Parrot nesting in the edges and hollows of  a tiny travertine-limestone island (Goat Island) in an inlet at the  eastern end of the Great Australian Bight. The eggs were laid on the  bare earth, often within two or three feet of high-tide mark. The  whole island was less than an acre in extent, and at no point was ten  feet above high-tide level. Many similar islands on the Australian  coast have not yet been explored ornithologically, so we do not know  what matters of interest are awaiting us.    The next bird, the Swift-flying Lorikeet, is a honey feeder, like the  first four Parrots (Lorikeets) mentioned. It is often found with  them, and was common all the winter, and is common now in a clump  of flowering gums outside the Melbourne Cricket Ground. It has given  scientists much trouble as to its correct name and position. It can  be distinguished from the \"Green Keets\" by having scarlet under the  wings.    The beautiful and affectionate little Budgerigar (Warbling Grass  Parrot), or Love Bird, has many names. It is migratory, and sometimes  appears in thousands, though it may not be seen again for years. It is  a favorite cage bird, and breeds as freely as caged canaries, so it is  well-known in Europe.    The last two Parrots are ground birds, which never perch or climb.  It was feared that the Ground Parrot was extinct, but it is seen  occasionally in the National Park at Wilson's Promontory. The Night  Parrot is better called the Western Ground Parrot. It is found amongst  the Spinifex (_Triodia_) scrub of the interior.    Though Parrots are essentially \"climbers,\" having the suitable  arrangement of two toes in front and two behind, it is interesting to  learn of these two Australian Parrots which cannot perch or climb. The  Parrot's foot is of interest, further, in so far as it is used as a  hand, and the food is held in it while being eaten. The powerful bill  not only serves to reduce its food to powder, but also assists in  climbing. It is sometimes amusing to note the \"absurd caution,\" and  great deliberation with which a parrot climbs down in his cage to pick  up some dainty.    Possessing no less than 76 kinds of Parrots and Cockatoos, Australians  should be alive to their privileges as contrasted with the dwellers of  northern lands, where Parrots do not live. They should insist on the  proper protection of these beautiful and wonderful birds.    ====      [Page 88]      [Illustration: [184] [185] [186] [187] [188]]        ORDER XVII.--PSITTACIFORMES.
