The big man brought the  bang-stick, and Nag fell in two pieces! He will never eat my babies  again.\"    \"All that's true enough. But where's Nagaina?\" said Rikki-tikki, looking  carefully round him.    \"Nagaina came to the bathroom sluice and called for Nag,\" Darzee went  on, \"and Nag came out on the end of a stick--the sweeper picked him up  on the end of a stick and threw him upon the rubbish heap. Let us sing  about the great, the red-eyed Rikki-tikki!\" And Darzee filled his throat  and sang.    \"If I could get up to your nest, I'd roll your babies out!\" said  Rikki-tikki. \"You don't know when to do the right thing at the right  time. You're safe enough in your nest there, but it's war for me down  here. Stop singing a minute, Darzee.\"    \"For the great, the beautiful Rikki-tikki's sake I will stop,\" said  Darzee. \"What is it, O Killer of the terrible Nag?\"    \"Where is Nagaina, for the third time?\"    \"On the rubbish heap by the stables, mourning for Nag. Great is  Rikki-tikki with the white teeth.\"    \"Bother my white teeth! Have you ever heard where she keeps her eggs?\"    \"In the melon bed, on the end nearest the wall, where the sun strikes  nearly all day. She hid them there weeks ago.\"    \"And you never thought it worth while to tell me? The end nearest the  wall, you said?\"    \"Rikki-tikki, you are not going to eat her eggs?\"    \"Not eat exactly; no. Darzee, if you have a grain of sense you will fly  off to the stables and pretend that your wing is broken, and let Nagaina  chase you away to this bush. I must get to the melon-bed, and if I went  there now she'd see me.\"    Darzee was a feather-brained little fellow who could never hold more  than one idea at a time in his head. And just because he knew that  Nagaina's children were born in eggs like his own, he didn't think at  first that it was fair to kill them. But his wife was a sensible bird,  and she knew that cobra's eggs meant young cobras later on. So she flew  off from the nest, and left Darzee to keep the babies warm, and continue  his song about the death of Nag. Darzee was very like a man in some  ways.    She fluttered in front of Nagaina by the rubbish heap and cried out,  \"Oh, my wing is broken! The boy in the house threw a stone at me and  broke it.\" Then she fluttered more desperately than ever.    Nagaina lifted up her head and hissed, \"You warned Rikki-tikki when I  would have killed him. Indeed and truly, you've chosen a bad place to  be lame in.\" And she moved toward Darzee's wife, slipping along over the  dust.    \"The boy broke it with a stone!\" shrieked Darzee's wife.    \"Well! It may be some consolation to you when you're dead to know that I  shall settle accounts with the boy. My husband lies on the rubbish heap  this morning, but before night the boy in the house will lie very still.  What is the use of running away? I am sure to catch you. Little fool,  look at me!\"    Darzee's wife knew better than to do that, for a bird who looks at a  snake's eyes gets so frightened that she cannot move. Darzee's wife  fluttered on, piping sorrowfully, and never leaving the ground, and  Nagaina quickened her pace.    Rikki-tikki heard them going up the path from the stables, and he raced  for the end of the melon patch near the wall. There, in the warm litter  above the melons, very cunningly hidden, he found twenty-five eggs,  about the size of a bantam's eggs, but with whitish skin instead of  shell.    \"I was not a day too soon,\" he said, for he could see the baby cobras  curled up inside the skin, and he knew that the minute they were hatched  they could each kill a man or a mongoose. He bit off the tops of the  eggs as fast as he could, taking care to crush the young cobras, and  turned over the litter from time to time to see whether he had missed  any. At last there were only three eggs left, and Rikki-tikki began to  chuckle to himself, when he heard Darzee's wife screaming:    \"Rikki-tikki, I led Nagaina toward the house, and she has gone into the  veranda, and--oh, come quickly--she means killing!\"    Rikki-tikki smashed two eggs, and tumbled backward down the melon-bed  with the third egg in his mouth, and scuttled to the veranda as hard as  he could put foot to the ground. Teddy and his mother and father were  there at early breakfast, but Rikki-tikki saw that they were not eating  anything. They sat stone-still, and their faces were white. Nagaina was  coiled up on the matting by Teddy's chair, within easy striking distance  of Teddy's bare leg, and she was swaying to and fro, singing a song of  triumph.    \"Son of the big man that killed Nag,\" she hissed, \"stay still. I am not  ready yet. Wait a little. Keep very still, all you three! If you move I  strike, and if you do not move I strike. Oh, foolish people, who killed  my Nag!\"    Teddy's eyes were fixed on his father, and all his father could do was  to whisper, \"Sit still, Teddy. You mustn't move. Teddy, keep still.\"    Then Rikki-tikki came up and cried, \"Turn round, Nagaina. Turn and  fight!\"    \"All in good time,\" said she, without moving her eyes. \"I will settle my  account with you presently. Look at your friends, Rikki-tikki. They are  still and white. They are afraid. They dare not move, and if you come a  step nearer I strike.\"    \"Look at your eggs,\" said Rikki-tikki, \"in the melon bed near the wall.  Go and look, Nagaina!\"    The big snake turned half around, and saw the egg on the veranda. \"Ah-h!  Give it to me,\" she said.    Rikki-tikki put his paws one on each side of the egg, and his eyes were  blood-red. \"What price for a snake's egg? For a young cobra? For a  young king cobra? For the last--the very last of the brood? The ants are  eating all the others down by the melon bed.\"    Nagaina spun clear round, forgetting everything for the sake of the one  egg. Rikki-tikki saw Teddy's father shoot out a big hand, catch Teddy  by the shoulder, and drag him across the little table with the tea-cups,  safe and out of reach of Nagaina.    \"Tricked! Tricked! Tricked! Rikk-tck-tck!\" chuckled Rikki-tikki. \"The  boy is safe, and it was I--I--I that caught Nag by the hood last night  in the bathroom.\" Then he began to jump up and down, all four feet  together, his head close to the floor. \"He threw me to and fro, but he  could not shake me off. He was dead before the big man blew him in two.  I did it! Rikki-tikki-tck-tck! Come then, Nagaina. Come and fight with  me. You shall not be a widow long.\"    Nagaina saw that she had lost her chance of killing Teddy, and the egg  lay between Rikki-tikki's paws. \"Give me the egg, Rikki-tikki. Give me  the last of my eggs, and I will go away and never come back,\" she said,  lowering her hood.    \"Yes, you will go away, and you will never come back. For you will go  to the rubbish heap with Nag. Fight, widow! The big man has gone for his  gun! Fight!\"    Rikki-tikki was bounding all round Nagaina, keeping just out of reach  of her stroke, his little eyes like hot coals. Nagaina gathered herself  together and flung out at him. Rikki-tikki jumped up and backward. Again  and again and again she struck, and each time her head came with a whack  on the matting of the veranda and she gathered herself together like a  watch spring. Then Rikki-tikki danced in a circle to get behind her, and  Nagaina spun round to keep her head to his head, so that the rustle of  her tail on the matting sounded like dry leaves blown along by the wind.    He had forgotten the egg. It still lay on the veranda, and Nagaina came  nearer and nearer to it, till at last, while Rikki-tikki was drawing  breath, she caught it in her mouth, turned to the veranda steps, and  flew like an arrow down the path, with Rikki-tikki behind her. When  the cobra runs for her life, she goes like a whip-lash flicked across a  horse's neck.    Rikki-tikki knew that he must catch her, or all the trouble would begin  again. She headed straight for the long grass by the thorn-bush, and as  he was running Rikki-tikki heard Darzee still singing his foolish little  song of triumph. But Darzee's wife was wiser. She flew off her nest  as Nagaina came along, and flapped her wings about Nagaina's head. If  Darzee had helped they might have turned her, but Nagaina only lowered  her hood and went on. Still, the instant's delay brought Rikki-tikki up  to her, and as she plunged into the rat-hole where she and Nag used to  live, his little white teeth were clenched on her tail, and he went down  with her--and very few mongooses, however wise and old they may be,  care to follow a cobra into its hole. It was dark in the hole; and  Rikki-tikki never knew when it might open out and give Nagaina room to  turn and strike at him. He held on savagely, and stuck out his feet to  act as brakes on the dark slope of the hot, moist earth.    Then the grass by the mouth of the hole stopped waving, and Darzee said,  \"It is all over with Rikki-tikki! We must sing his death song. Valiant  Rikki-tikki is dead! For Nagaina will surely kill him underground.\"    So he sang a very mournful song that he made up on the spur of the  minute, and just as he got to the most touching part, the grass quivered  again, and Rikki-tikki, covered with dirt, dragged himself out of the  hole leg by leg, licking his whiskers. Darzee stopped with a little  shout. Rikki-tikki shook some of the dust out of his fur and sneezed.  \"It is all over,\" he said. \"The widow will never come out again.\" And  the red ants that live between the grass stems heard him, and began to  troop down one after another to see if he had spoken the truth.    Rikki-tikki curled himself up in the grass and slept where he was--slept  and slept till it was late in the afternoon, for he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23609"],[0,"Searchlights on Health: Light on Dark Corners (#20)"],[1,"than a woman of the same age  unhappily married. Old maids and bachelors always look older {120} than  they are. A flirting widow always looks younger than an old maid of like  age.    12. Love renders women industrious and frugal, and a loving husband spends  lavishly on a loved wife and children, though miserly towards others.    13. Love cultivates self-respect and produces beauty. Beauty in walk and  beauty in looks; a girl in love is at her best; it brings out the finest  traits of her character, she walks more erect and is more generous and  forgiving; her voice is sweeter and she makes happy all about her. She  works better, sings better and is better.    14. Now in conclusion, a love marriage is the best life insurance policy;  it pays dividends every day, while every other insurance policy merely  promises to pay after death. Remember that statistics demonstrate that  married people outlive old maids and old bachelors by a goodly number of  years and enjoy healthier and happier lives.           *       *       *       *       *      {122}    Amativeness or Connubial Love.    [Illustration: CONFIDENCE.]    1. MULTIPLYING THE RACE.--Some means for multiplying our race is necessary  to prevent its extinction by death. Propagation and death appertain to  man's earthly existence. If the Deity had seen fit to bring every member of  the human family into being by a direct act of creative power, without the  agency of parents, the present wise and benevolent arrangements of husbands  and wives, parents and children, friends and neighbors, would have been  superseded, and all opportunities for exercising parental and connubial  love, in which so much enjoyment is taken, cut off. But the domestic  feelings and relations, as now arranged, must strike every philosophical  observer as inimitably beautiful and perfect--as the offspring of infinite  Wisdom and Goodness combined.    2. AMATIVENESS AND ITS COMBINATIONS constitute their origin, counterpart,  and main medium of manifestation. Its primary function is connubial love.  From it, mainly, spring those feelings which exist between the sexes as  such and {123} result in marriage and offspring. Combined with the higher  sentiments, it gives rise to all those reciprocal kind feelings and  nameless courtesies which each sex manifests towards the other; refining  and elevating both, promoting gentility and politeness, and greatly  increasing social and general happiness.    3. RENDERS MEN MORE POLITE TO WOMEN.--So far from being in the least gross  or indelicate, its proper exercise is pure, chaste, virtuous, and even an  ingredient in good manners. It is this which renders men always more polite  towards women than to one another, and more refined in their society, and  which makes women more kind, grateful, genteel and tender towards men than  women. It makes mothers love their sons more than their daughters, and  fathers more attached to their daughters. Man's endearing recollections of  his mother or wife form his most powerful incentives to virtue, study, and  good deeds, as well as restraints upon his vicious inclinations; and, in  proportion as a young man is dutiful and affectionate to his mother, will  he be fond of his wife; for, this faculty is the parent of both.    4. ALL SHOULD CULTIVATE THE FACULTY OF AMATIVENESS OR CONNUBIAL  LORE.--Study the personal charms and mental accomplishments of the other  sex by ardent admirers of beautiful forms, and study graceful movements and  elegant manners, and remember, much depends upon the tones and accents of  the voice. Never be gruff if you desire to be winning. Seek and enjoy and  reciprocate fond looks and feelings. Before you can create favorable  impressions you must first be honest and sincere and natural, and your  conquest will be sure and certain.           *       *       *       *       *    Love and Common-Sense.    1. Do you love her because she goes to the altar with her head full of book  learning, her hands of no earthly use, save for the piano and brush;  because she has no conception of the duties and responsibilities of a wife;  because she hates housework, hates its everlasting routine and ever  recurring duties; because she hates children and will adopt every means to  evade motherhood; because she loves her ease, loves to have her will  supreme, loves, oh how well, to be free to go and come, to let the days  slip idly by, to be absolved from all responsibility, to live without  labor, without care? Will you love her selfish, shirking, calculating  nature after twenty years of close companionship?    2. Do you love him because he is a man, and therefore, no matter how weak  mentally, morally or physically he may {124} be, he has vested in him the  power to save you from the ignominy of an old maid's existence? Because you  would rather be Mrs. Nobody, than make the effort to be Miss Somebody?  because you have a great empty place in your head and heart that nothing  but a man can fill? because you feel you cannot live without him? God grant  the time may never come when you cannot live with him.    [Illustration: AN EARNEST CALLER.]    3. Do you love her because she is a thoroughly womanly woman; for her  tender sympathetic nature; for the jewels of her life, which are absolute  purity of mind and heart; for the sweet sincerity of her disposition; for  her loving, charitable thought; for her strength of character? because she  is pitiful to the sinful, tender to the sorrowful, capable, self-reliant,  modest, true-hearted? in brief, because she is the embodiment of all  womanly virtues?    4. Do you love him because he is a manly man; because the living and  operating principle of his life is a tender reverence for all women;  because his love is the overflow of the best part of his nature; because he  has never soiled his soul with an unholy act or his lips with an oath;  because mentally he is a man among men; because physically he stands head  and shoulders above the masses; because morally he is far beyond suspicion,  in his thought, word or deed; because his earnest manly consecrated life is  a mighty power on God's side?    5. But there always has been and always will be unhappy marriages until men  learn what husbandhood means; how to care for that tenderly matured,  delicately constituted being, that he takes into his care and keeping. That  if her wonderful adjusted organism is overtaxed and overburdened, her  happiness, which is largely dependent upon her health, is destroyed.    6. Until men give the women they marry the undivided love of their heart;  until constancy is the key-note of a life which speaks eloquently of clean  thoughts and clean hearts.    7. Until men and women recognize that self-control in a man, and modesty in  a woman, will bring a mutual respect that years of wedded life will only  strengthen. Until they recognize that love is the purest and holiest of all  things known to humanity, will marriage continue to bring unhappiness and  discontent, instead of that comfort and restful peace which all loyal souls  have a right to expect and enjoy.    8. Be sensible and marry a sensible, honest and industrious companion, and  happiness through life will be your reward.    {126}    [Illustration]    What Women Love in Men.    1. Women naturally love courage, force and firmness in men. The ideal man  in a woman's eye must be heroic and brave. Woman naturally despises a  coward, and she has little or no respect for a bashful man.    2. Woman naturally loves her lord and master. Women who desperately object  to be overruled, nevertheless admire men who overrule them, and few women  would have any respect for a man whom they could completely rule and  control.    3. Man is naturally the protector of woman; as the male wild animal of the  forest protects the female, so it is natural for man to protect his wife  and children, and therefore woman admires those qualities in a man which  make him a protector.    4. LARGE MEN.--Women naturally love men of strength, size and fine  physique, a tall, large and strong man rather than a short, small and weak  man. A woman always pities a weakly man, but rarely ever has any love for  him.    5. SMALL AND WEAKLY MEN.--All men would be of good size in frame and flesh,  were it not for the infirmities visited upon them by the indiscretion of  parents and ancestors of generations before.    6. YOUTHFUL SEXUAL EXCITEMENT.--There are many children born healthy and  vigorous who destroy the full vigor of their generative organs in youth by  self-abuse, and if they survive and marry, their children will have small  bones, small frames and sickly constitutions. It is therefore not strange  that instinct should lead women to admire men not touched with these  symptoms of physical debility.    7. GENEROSITY.--Woman generally loves a generous man. Religion absorbs a  great amount of money in temples, churches, ministerial salaries, etc., and  ambition and appetite absorb countless millions, yet woman receives more  gifts from man than all these combined: she {127} loves a generous giver.  _Generosity and Gallantry_ are the jewels which she most admires. A woman  receiving presents from a man implies that she will pay him back in love,  and the woman who accepts a man's presents, and does not respect him,  commits a wrong which is rarely ever forgiven.    8. INTELLIGENCE.--Above all other qualities in man, woman admires his  intelligence. Intelligence is man's woman-captivating card. This character  in woman is illustrated by an English army officer, as told by O. S.  Fowler, betrothed in marriage to a beautiful, loving heiress, summoned to  India, who wrote back to her:    \"I have lost an eye, a leg, an arm, and been so badly marred and begrimmed  besides, that you never could love this poor, maimed soldier. Yet, I love  you too well to make your life wretched by requiring you to keep your  marriage-vow with me, from which I"]]]
