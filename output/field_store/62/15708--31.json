The  calls and appearances of various birds and of the MUNTJAC are of chief  importance. Some of these are good, some bad in various degrees. When  a preponderance of favourable omens has been observed, the men return  to the house to announce their success. They will wait two whole days  if necessary to secure a favourable result. During their absence  a strict MALAN or LALI (tabu) lies upon the house; no stranger may  enter it, and the people sit quietly in the house performing only  the most necessary tasks. The announcement of the nature of the omens  observed is made to the chief in the presence of a deeply interested  throng of both sexes. If the omens observed are considered to be bad,  or of doubtful import, the men go out for a second period; but if they  are favourable, the women of each room perform the private rites over  their stores of seed PADI, which are kept in their rooms. After the  pros and cons have been fully discussed, the chief names the day for  the beginning of the clearing operations.    At the beginning of the sowing the house is again subject to MALAN for  one day. During the growth of the PADI various charms and superstitious  practices are brought into use to promote its growth and health,  and to keep the pests from it. The PADI charms are a miscellaneous  collection or bundle of small articles, such as curious pebbles and  bits of wood, pigs' tusks of unusual size or shape, beads, feathers,  crystals of quartz. Kayans as a rule object to pebbles and stones  as charms. Such charms are generally acquired in the first instance  through indications afforded by dreams, and are handed down from  mother to daughter. Such charms contained in a basket are usually  kept in a PADI barn, from which they are taken to the field by the  woman and waved over it, usually with a live fowl in the hand, while  she addresses the PADI seed in some such terms as the following:  \"May you have a good stem and a good top, let all parts of you grow  in harmony, etc. etc.\" Then she rapidly repeats a long customary  formula of exhortation to the pests, saying, \"O rats, run away down  river, don't trouble us; O sparrows and noxious insects, go feed on  the PADI of the people down river.\" If the pests are very persistent,  the woman may kill a fowl and scatter its blood over the growing PADI,  while she charges the pests to disappear, and calls upon LAKI IVONG  (the god of harvests) to drive them out.    Women alone will gather the first ears of the crop. If they encounter  on their way to the fields any one of the following creatures,  they must at once return home, and stay there a day and a night, on  pain of illness or early death: certain snakes, spiders, centipedes,  millipedes, and birds of two species, JERUIT and BUBUT (a cuckoo). Or  again, if the shoulder straps of their large baskets should break  on the way, if a stump should fall against them, or the note of the  spider-hunter be heard, or if a woman strikes her foot by accident  against any object, the party must return as before.    It will be clear from the foregoing account that the women play the  principal part in the rites and actual operations of the PADI culture;  the men only being called in to clear the ground and to assist in  some of the later stages. The women select and keep the seed grain,  and they are the repositories of most of the lore connected with  it. It seems to be felt that they have a natural affinity to the  fruitful grain, which they speak of as becoming pregnant. Women  sometimes sleep out in the PADI fields while the crop is growing,  probably for the purpose of increasing their own fertility or that  of the PADI; but they are very reticent on this matter.      The Harvest Festival    When the crop is all gathered in, the house is MALAN to all outsiders  for some ten days, during which the grain is transported from the  fields to the village and stored in the PADI barns. When this process  is completed or well advanced, the festival begins with the preparation  of the seed grain for the following season. Some of the best of the  new grain is carefully selected by the women of each room, enough for  the sowing of the next season. This is mixed with a small quantity  of the seed grain of the foregoing seasons which has been carefully  preserved for this purpose in a special basket. The basket contains  grains of PADI from good harvests of many previous years. This is  supposed to have been done from the earliest time of PADI planting,  so that the basket contains some of the original stock of seed, or  at least the virtue of it leavening the whole. This basket is never  emptied, but a pinch of the old PADI is mixed in with the new, and  then a handful of the mixture added to the old stock. The idea here  seems to be that the old grain, preserving continuity generation after  generation with the original seed PADI of mythical origin,[47] ensures  the presence in the grain of the soul or spirit or vital principle of  PADI. While mixing the old with the new seed grain, the woman calls  on the soul of the PADI to cause the seed to be fruitful and to grow  vigorously, and to favour her own fertility. For the whole festival  is a celebration or cult of the principle of fertility and vitality --  that of the women no less than that of the PADI.[48]    The women who have been delivered of children during the past year  will make a number of toys, consisting of plaited work, in the shapes  of various animals filled with boiled rice (Fig. 16). These they  throw to the children of the house, who scramble for them in the  gallery. This seems to be of the nature of a thank-offering.    At this time also another curious custom is observed. Four water  beetles, of the kind that skates on the surface of the still water, are  caught on the river and placed on water in a large gong. Some old man  specially wise in this matter watches the beetles, calling to them to  direct their movements. The people crowd round deeply interested, while  the old man interprets the movements of the beetles as forecasting  good or ill luck with the crops of the following season, and invokes  the good-will of Laki Ivong. Laki Ivong is asked to bring the soul  of the PADI to their homes. Juice from a sugarcane is poured upon the  water, and the women drink the water, while the beetles are carefully  returned to the river. The beetles carry the messages to Laki Ivong.    When these observances have been duly honoured, there begins a  scene of boisterous fun. The women make pads of the boiled sticky  new rice, and cover it with soot from their cooking vessels. With  these they approach the men and dab the pads upon their faces and  bodies, leaving sooty marks that are not easily removed. The men  thus challenged give chase, and attempt to get possession of the rice  pads and to return the polite attention. For a short space of time a  certain license prevails among the young people; and irregularities,  even on the part of married people, which would be gravely reprobated  at all other times, are looked upon very much less seriously. It is,  in fact, the annual carnival. Each roomhold has prepared a stock of  BURAK from the new rice, and this now circulates freely among both men  and women, and large meals of rice and pork are usually eaten. All  join in dancing, some of the women dressed like men, some carrying  PADI-pestles; at one moment all form a long line marching up and  down the gallery in step to the strains of the KELURI; some young  men dance in realistic imitation of monkeys (DOK), or hornbills, or  other animals, singly or in couples. Others mimic the peculiarities  of their acquaintances. The women also dance together in a long line,  each resting her hands on the shoulders of the one going before her,  and all keeping time to the music of the KELURIES as they dance up  and down the long gallery. All this is kept up with good humour the  whole day long. In the evening more BURAK is drunk and songs are sung,  the women mingling with the men, instead of remaining in their rooms  as on other festive occasions. Before midnight a good many of the men  are more or less intoxicated, some deeply so; but most are able to  find their way to bed about midnight, and few or none become offensive  or quarrelsome, even though the men indulge in wrestling and rough  horseplay with one another. After an exceptionally good harvest the  boisterous merry-making is renewed on a second or even a third day.    The harvest festival is the time at which dancing is most  practised. The dances fall into two chief classes, namely, solo dances  and those in which many persons take part. Most of the solo dances take  the form of comic imitations of the movements of animals, especially  the big macaque monkey (DOK), the hornbill, and big fish. These dances  .seem to have no connection with magic or religion, but to be purely  aesthetic entertainments. The animals that are regarded with most awe  are never mimicked in this way. There are at least four distinct group  dances popular among the Kayans. Both men and women take part, the  women often dressing themselves as men for the occasion (Pl. 61). The  movements and evolutions are very simple. The LUPA resembles the dance  on return from war described in Chap. X. In the KAYO, a similar dance,  the dancers are led by a woman holding one of the dried heads which is  taken down for the purpose; the women, dressed in war-coats, pretending  to take the head from an enemy. The LAKEKUT Is a musical drill in which  the dancers stamp on the planks of the floor in time to the music. The  LUPAK is a kind of slow polka. In none of these do the dancers fall  into couples. A fifth dance, the dance of the departure of the spirit,  is a dramatic representation by three persons of the death of one of  them, and of his restoration to life by"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3310"],[0,"A Forgotten Empire (Vijayanagar): A Contribution to the History of India (#20)"],[1,"was brought to Melik Tuchar.... They came to Beder on the day of  the Ascension.\"    The Sultan's brother \"when in a campaign is followed by his mother  and sister, and 2000 women on horseback or on golden beds;[165]  at the head of his train are 300 ordinary horses in gold equipment.\"    \"Melik Tuchar moved from Beder with his army, 50,000 strong, against  the Indians.... The Sultan sent 50,000 of his own army.... With this  force Melik Tuchar went to fight against the great Indian dominion  of CHENUDAR. But the king of BINEDAR[166] possessed 300 elephants,  100,000 men of his own troops, and 50,000 horse.\"    The writer then gives details as to the rest of the Sultan's forces,  and the total comes to the enormous amount of over 900,000 foot,  190,000 horse, and 575 elephants.    \"The Sultan moved out with his army ... to join Melich Tuchar at  Kalbarga. But their campaign was not successful, for they took only one  Indian town, and that at the loss of many people and treasures.[167]    \"The Hindu Sultan Kadam is a very powerful prince. He possesses  a numerous army and resides on a mountain at BICHENEGHER. This  vast city is surrounded by three forts and intersected by a river,  bordering on one side on a dreadful jungle, and on the other on a  dale; a wonderful place and to any purpose convenient. On one side  it is quite inaccessible; a road gives right through the town, and as  the mountain rises high with a ravine below, the town is impregnable.    \"The enemy besieged it for a month and lost many people, owing to  the walls of water and food. Plenty of water was in sight but could  not be got at.    \"This Indian stronghold was ultimately taken by Melikh Khan Khoda,  who stormed it, and fought day and night to reduce it. The army  that made the siege with heavy guns had neither eaten nor drunk for  twenty days. He lost 5000 of his best soldiers. On the capture of  the town 20,000 inhabitants men and women, had their heads cut off,  20,000 young and old were made prisoners and sold.... The treasury,  however, having been found empty, the town was abandoned.\"    It is impossible to decide to what this refers, as we have no other  information of any capture of Vijayanagar by the Sultan's forces  at this period. But the traveller may have confused the place with  Rajahmundry or one of the eastern cities of Telingana.    In 1482 A.D., as before stated, Mahmud Shah II. succeeded to the throne  of Kulbarga, being then a boy of twelve, but his sovereignty was only  nominal. Constant disturbances took place; the nobles in many tracts  rose against the sovereign, and amongst others the governor of Goa  attempted to assert his independence, seizing many important places  on the coast; civil war raged at the capital; and before long the  great chiefs threw off all semblance of obedience to the authority  of the Bahmanis, and at length divided the kingdom amongst themselves.    At Vijayanagar, too, there seems to have been chaos, and about the time  when the Dakhani nobles finally revolted, Narasimha Raya had placed  himself on the throne and established a new and powerful dynasty.    The five separate kingdoms which arose in the Dakhan were those of  the Adil Shahs of Bijapur, with whom we have most to do; the Barid  Shahs of Bidr or Ahmadabad; the Imad Shahs of Birar; the Nizam Shahs  of Ahmadnagar; and the Qutb Shahs of Golkonda.    Adil Shah was the first of his line at Bijapur, and he proclaimed  his independence in A.D. 1489. The unhappy king Mahmud II. lived in  inglorious seclusion till December 18, A.D. 1517, and was nominally  succeeded by his eldest son, Ahmad. Ahmad died after two years' reign,  and was followed in rapid succession by his two brothers, Ala-ud-din  III. (deposed) and Wali (murdered), after whom Kalim Ullah, son of  Ahmad II., was nominally placed on the throne but was kept a close  prisoner, and with his death the Bahmani dynasty fell for ever.        CHAPTER 9    The First Kings of the Second Dynasty (A.D. 1490 to 1509)    Narasimha usurps the throne -- Flight of the late king -- Saluva  Timma -- Vira Narasimha -- Bijapur again attacks Vijayanagar --  The Portuguese in India -- They seize Goa -- Varthema's record --  Albuquerque.    In my \"Sketch of the Dynasties of Southern India,\" published in 1883  (p. 106), the following passage occurs: --    \"We now come to the second or Narasimha dynasty, whose scions became  more powerful than any monarchs who had ever reigned over the south of  India. Dr. Burnell fixes A.D. 1490 as the initial date of Narasimha's  reign, and at present no inscription that I can be sure of appears to  overthrow that statement. I observe, however, that Bishop Caldwell, in  his 'History of Tinnevelly' (p. 48), fixes the date of the beginning  of Narasimha's ... reign as A.D. 1487.... WE HAVE YET TO LEARN THE  HISTORY OF HIS ACQUIRING THE SOVEREIGNTY OF VIJAYANAGAR AND OUSTING  THE OLDER DYNASTY.\"    Nothing has since transpired to throw light on this subject, and the  whole matter has remained up to the present in its primeval darkness;  but this newly-found chronicle of Nuniz gives us the entire story  in most interesting form though I can by no means vouch for its  accuracy. It is, nevertheless, a RESUME of the traditional history  of the early sixteenth century, written within fifty or sixty years  of the events with which it deals. He tells us that Virupaksha Raya  (\"Verupacarao\") was a weak and unworthy sovereign, in whose days  large tracts of land were lost to the Muhammadans, including Goa,  Chaul, and Dabhol; and this statement, at least, is historically  accurate. Virupaksha was despotic, cruel, and sensuous, \"caring for  nothing but women and to fuddle himself with drink,\" so that the whole  country was roused to indignation and rebellion. Eventually he was  murdered by his eldest son, who in his turn was slain by his brother  \"Padearao,\" in whom the nation merely found repeated the crimes and  follies of his dead sire. Disgusted with this line of sovereigns,  the nobles rose, deposed their king, and placed on the throne one  of their own number, Narasimha -- \"Narsymgua, WHO WAS IN SOME MANNER  AKIN TO HIM.\"    Nuniz gives us a graphic account of the last scenes; how Narasimha's  captain arrived at the city gates and found them undefended; how he  penetrated the palace and found no one to oppose him; how he even  went as far as the harem, \"slaying some of the women;\" and how at  last the craven king fled.    \"After that, Narasymgua was raised to be king.... And as he had much  power and was beloved by the people, thence-forward this kingdom of  Bisnaga was called the kingdom of Narsymga.\"    The problem of Narasimha's relationship to the old royal line has never  yet been satisfactorily solved. He belonged to a family called SALUVA,  and we constantly hear, in the inscriptions and literary works of the  time, of powerful lords who were relations or descendants of his. Thus  our chronicle has much to say about the Saluva Timma, whom Nuniz  calls \"Salvatinea,\" who was minister to King Krishna Deva Raya. An  inscription of the Saka year 1395, which corresponds to A.D. 1472 --  73, speaks of Narasimha as a great lord, but a great lord ONLY,[168]  and so does another of A.D. 1482 -- 83.[169] In one of A.D. 1495 -- 96,  however,[170] he is called \"MAHA-RAYA,\" or the \"king.\" But although  the exact date of the usurpation and the exact relationship of the  usurper to the deposed king may be difficult to ascertain, the fact  remains that Narasimha actually became sovereign about this time,  that Muhammadan aggression was stayed by his power and the force  of his arms, and that the empire of Vijayanagar was under him once  more consolidated.    The account of this period as given by Firishtah differs  altogether from that of Nuniz, and gives rise to much confusion and  difficulty. And as to the relationship of the succeeding sovereigns,  Narasa, Vira Narasimha, Krishna Deva Raya, Achyuta, and Sadasiva,  the native inscriptions themselves are totally at variance with one  another. Some few points, however, in the general scheme of history  of the second dynasty are quite certain, and these may be shortly  summarised. The last kings of the first dynasty were recognised down to  ABOUT the year 1490 A.D. Narasimha and Vira Narasimha ruled till the  accession of Krishna Deva Raya in 1509; Achyuta succeeded Krishna in  1530, and Sadasiva succeeded Achyuta in 1542. The latter was virtually  a prisoner in the hands of Rama Raya, the eldest of three brothers, at  first nominally his minister, but afterwards independent. The names of  the other brothers were Tirumala and Venkatadri. These three men held  the government of the kingdom till 1565, when the empire was utterly  overthrown by a confederation of the five Muhammadan kings of the  Dakhan, already mentioned, at the battle of Talikota -- so-called --  and the magnificent capital was almost wiped out of existence.    With these few facts to guide us, we turn to the chronicles of Nuniz  and Firishtah, trying in vain to obtain some points of contact  between them as to the origin of the second dynasty -- some clue  which will enable us to reconcile differences and arrive at the real  truth. If we are to be guided purely by probabilities, it would seem  that the history given by Nuniz is likely to be the more accurate of  the two. His chronicle was written about the year 1535, during the  reign of Achyuta; he lived at the Hindu capital itself, and he gained  his information from Hindu sources not long subsequent to the events  related. Firishtah did not write till about A.D. 1607, was not in any  sense a contemporary recorder, and did not live amongst the Hindus,  but at the court of Nizam Shah at Ahmadnagar. The lengths of reigns,  however, as given by Nuniz do not tally with the dates which we obtain  from sources undoubtedly reliable.    Nuniz has it that Virupaksha's son \"Padearao,\" the last of the old  line,"]]]
