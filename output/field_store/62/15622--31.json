The sun is so vast that he has not yet had time to cool; the  earth, of intermediate bulk, has become cold on the outside, while still  retaining vast stores of internal heat; while the moon, the smallest  body of all, has lost its heat to such an extent that changes of  importance on its surface can no longer be originated by internal fires.    We are thus led to refer the origin of the lunar craters to some ancient  epoch in the moon's history. We have no moans of knowing the remoteness  of that epoch, but it is reasonable to surmise that the antiquity of the  lunar volcanoes must be extremely great. At the time when the moon was  sufficiently heated to originate those convulsions, of which the mighty  craters are the survivals, the earth must also have been much hotter  than it is at present. When the moon possessed sufficient heat for its  volcanoes to be active, the earth was probably so hot that life was  impossible on its surface. This supposition would point to an antiquity  for the lunar craters far too great to be estimated by the centuries and  the thousands of years which are adequate for such periods as those with  which the history of human events is concerned. It seems not unlikely  that millions of years may have elapsed since the mighty craters of  Plato or of Copernicus consolidated into their present form.    We shall now attempt to account for the formation of the lunar craters.  The most probable views on the subject seem to be those which have been  set forth by Mr. Nasmyth, though it must be admitted that his doctrines  are by no means free from difficulty. According to his theory we can  explain how the rampart around the lunar crater has been formed, and how  the great mountain arose which so often adorns the centre of the plain.  The view in Fig. 28 contains an imaginary sketch of a volcanic vent on  the moon in the days when the craters were active. The eruption is here  shown in the fulness of its energy, when the internal forces are hurling  forth ashes or stones which fall at a considerable distance from the  vent. The materials thus accumulated constitute the rampart surrounding  the crater.    The second picture (Fig. 29) depicts the crater in a later stage of its  history. The prodigious explosive power has now been exhausted, and has  perhaps been intermitted for some time. Again, the volcano bursts into  activity, but this time with only a small part of its original energy. A  comparatively feeble eruption now issues from the same vent, deposits  materials close around the orifice, and raises a mountain in the centre.  Finally, when the activity has subsided, and the volcano is silent and  still, we find the evidence of the early energy testified to by the  rampart which surrounds the ancient crater, and by the mountain which  adorns the interior. The flat floor which is found in some of the  craters may not improbably have arisen from an outflow of lava which has  afterwards consolidated. Subsequent outbreaks have also occurred in many  cases.    One of the principal difficulties attending this method of accounting  for the structure of a crater arises from the great size which some of  these objects attain. There are ancient volcanoes on the moon forty or  fifty miles in diameter; indeed, there is one well-formed ring, with a  mountain rising in the centre, the diameter of which is no less than  seventy-eight miles (Petavius). It seems difficult to conceive how a  blowing cone at the centre could convey the materials to such a distance  as the thirty-nine miles between the centre of Petavius and the rampart.  The explanation is, however, facilitated when it is borne in mind that  the force of gravitation is much less on the moon than on the earth.    [Illustration: PLATE VIII.    A NORMAL LUNAR CRATER.]    [Illustration: Fig. 28.--Volcano in Activity.]    [Illustration: Fig. 29.--Subsequent Feeble Activity.]    Have we not already seen that our satellite is so much smaller than the  earth that eighty moons rolled into one would not weigh as much as the  earth? On the earth an ounce weighs an ounce and a pound weighs a pound;  but a weight of six ounces here would only weigh one ounce on the moon,  and a weight of six pounds here would only weigh one pound on the moon.  A labourer who can carry one sack of corn on the earth could, with the  same exertion, carry six sacks of corn on the moon. A cricketer who can  throw a ball 100 yards on the earth could with precisely the same  exertion throw the same ball 600 yards on the moon. Hiawatha could shoot  ten arrows into the air one after the other before the first reached  the ground; on the moon he might have emptied his whole quiver. The  volcano, which on the moon drove projectiles to the distance of  thirty-nine miles, need only possess the same explosive power as would  have been sufficient to drive the missiles six or seven miles on the  earth. A modern cannon properly elevated would easily achieve this feat.    [Illustration: Fig. 30.--Formation of the Level Floor by Lava.]    It must also be borne in mind that there are innumerable craters on the  moon of the same general type but of the most varied dimensions; from a  tiny telescopic object two or three miles in diameter, we can point out  gradually ascending stages until we reach the mighty Petavius just  considered. With regard to the smaller craters, there is obviously  little or no difficulty in attributing to them a volcanic origin, and as  the continuity from the smallest to the largest craters is unbroken, it  seems quite reasonable to suppose that even the greatest has arisen in  the same way.    It should, however, be remarked that some lunar features might be  explained by actions from without rather than from within. Mr. G.K.  Gilbert has marshalled the evidence in support of the belief that lunar  sculptures arise from the impact of bodies falling on the moon. The Mare  Imbrium, according to this view, has been the seat of a collision to  which the surrounding lunar scenery is due. Mr. Gilbert explains the  furrows as hewn out by mighty projectiles moving with such velocities as  meteors possess.    The lunar landscapes are excessively weird and rugged. They always  remind us of sterile deserts, and we cannot fail to notice the absence  of grassy plains or green forests such as we are familiar with on our  globe. In some respects the moon is not very differently circumstanced  from the earth. Like it, the moon has the pleasing alternations of day  and night, though the day in the moon is as long as twenty-nine of our  days, and the night of the moon is as long as twenty-nine of our nights.  We are warmed by the rays of the sun; so, too, is the moon; but,  whatever may be the temperature during the long day on the moon, it  seems certain that the cold of the lunar night would transcend that  known in the bleakest regions of our earth. The amount of heat radiated  to us by the moon has been investigated by Lord Rosse, and more recently  by Professor Langley. Though every point on the moon's surface is  exposed to the sunlight for a fortnight without any interruption, the  actual temperature to which the soil is raised cannot be a high one. The  moon does not, like the earth, possess a warm blanket, in the shape of  an atmosphere, which can keep in and accumulate the heat received.    Even our largest telescopes can tell nothing directly as to whether life  can exist on the moon. The mammoth trees of California might be growing  on the lunar mountains, and elephants might be walking about on the  plains, but our telescopes could not show them. The smallest object that  we can see on the moon must be about as large as a good-sized cathedral,  so that organised beings resembling in size any that we are familiar  with, if they existed, could not make themselves visible as telescopic  objects.    We are therefore compelled to resort to indirect evidence as to whether  life would be possible on the moon. We may say at once that astronomers  believe that life, as we know it, could not exist. Among the necessary  conditions of life, water is one of the first. Take every form of  vegetable life, from the lichen which grows on the rock to the giant  tree of the forest, and we find the substance of every plant contains  water, and could not exist without it. Nor is water less necessary to  the existence of animal life. Deprived of this element, all organic  life, the life of man himself, would be inconceivable.    Unless, therefore, water be present in the moon, we shall be bound to  conclude that life, as we know it, is impossible. If anyone stationed on  the moon were to look at the earth through a telescope, would he be able  to see any water here? Most undoubtedly he would. He would see the  clouds and he would notice their incessant changes, and the clouds alone  would be almost conclusive evidence of the existence of water. An  astronomer on the moon would also see our oceans as coloured surfaces,  remarkably contrasted with the land, and he would perhaps frequently see  an image of the sun, like a brilliant star, reflected from some smooth  portion of the sea. In fact, considering that much more than half of our  globe is covered with oceans, and that most of the remainder is liable  to be obscured by clouds, the lunar astronomer in looking at our earth  would often see hardly anything but water in one form or other. Very  likely he would come to the conclusion that our globe was only fitted to  be a residence for amphibious animals.    But when we look at the moon with our telescopes we see no direct  evidence of water. Close inspection shows that the so-called lunar seas  are deserts, often marked with small craters and rocks. The telescope  reveals no seas and no oceans, no lakes and no rivers. Nor is the  grandeur of the moon's scenery ever impaired by clouds over her surface.  Whenever the moon is above our horizon,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2743"],[0,"Massacres of the South (1551-1815) (#20)"],[1," left the table without being in a pleasant  humour, and at such a moment if it came into his head that anyone in his  diocese was not as good a Christian as himself, he would sit down and  write to M. de Baville, urging that the delinquent ought to be sent into  exile. He often did this honour to my late father.\" M. d'Aygaliers goes  on to say that \"on seeing such a great number of Huguenots in the court  who were all declaring that they were better servants of the king than  the Catholics, he almost fell from his balcony with vexation and  surprise. This vexation increased when he saw M. de Villars and M. de  Baville, who had apartments in the palace, come down into the court and  talk to these people. One hope still remained to him: it was that the  marechal and the intendant had come down to send them away; but this  last hope was cruelly disappointed when he heard M. de Villars say that  he accepted their service and expected them to obey d'Aygaliers in all  matters concerning the service of the king.\"    But this was not all that had to be accomplished arms were necessary for  the Protestants, and though their number was not great, there was a  difficulty in finding them weapons. The unfortunate Calvinists had been  disarmed so often that even their table-knives had been carried off, so  it was useless to search their houses for guns and sabres. D'Aygaliers  proposed that they should take the arms of the townspeople, but M. de  Villars considered that it would offend the Catholics to have their arms  taken from them and given to the Protestants. In the end, however, this  was the course that had to be adopted: M. de Paratte was ordered to give  fifty muskets and the same number of bayonets to M. d'Aygaliers, who  also received, as the reward of his long patience, from M. de Villars,  before the latter left for Nimes, the following commission:    \"We, Marechal de Villars, general in the armies of the king, etc., etc.,  have given permission to M. d'Aygaliers, nobleman and Protestant of the  town of Uzes, and to fifty men chosen by him, to make war on the  Camisards.    \"(Signed) \"VILLARS    \"Given at Uzes, the 4th of May 1704\"    Hardly had M. de Villars set out for Nimes than d'Aygaliers met with  fresh difficulties. The bishop, who could not forget that his episcopal  palace had been turned into barracks for Huguenots, went from house to  house threatening those who had promised to countenance d'Aygaliers'  plans, and strictly forbidding the captains of the town troops to  deliver any weapons to the Protestants. Fortunately, d'Aygaliers had not  accomplished so much without having learned not to draw back when the  road grew rough, so he also on his side went about confirming the strong  and encouraging the feeble, and called on M. de Paratte to beg him to  carry out the orders of M. de Villars. De Paratte was happily an old  soldier, whose one idea was that discipline should be maintained, so  that he gave the guns and bayonets to d'Aygaliers on the spot, without a  word of objection, and thus enabled the latter to start at five o'clock  next morning with his little band.    Meantime de Baville and de Lalande had been reflecting what great  influence d'Aygaliers would gain in the province should he succeed in  his aims, and their jealousy had made them resolve to forestall him in  his work, by themselves inducing Cavalier to abandon his present course.  They did not conceal from themselves that this would be difficult, but  as they could command means of corruption which were not within the  power of d'Aygaliers, they did not despair of success.    They therefore sent for a countryman called Lacombe, in order to enlist  him on their side; for Cavalier, when a boy, had been his shepherd for  two years, and both had remained friends ever since: this man undertook  to try and bring about a meeting between the two gentlemen and  Cavalier--an enterprise which would have been dangerous for anyone else.  He promised first of all to explain to Cavalier the offers of MM. de  Baville and de Lalande.    Lacombe kept his word: he set off the same day, and two days later  appeared before Cavalier. The first feeling of the young chief was  astonishment, the second pleasure. Lacombe could not have chosen a  better moment to speak of peace to his former shepherd.    \"Indeed,\" says Cavalier in his Memoirs, \"the loss which I had just  sustained at Nages was doubly painful to me because it was irreparable.  I had lost at one blow not only a great number of weapons, all my  ammunition, and all my money, but also a body of men, inured to danger  and fatigue, and capable of any undertaking;--besides all this, I had  been robbed of my stores--a loss which made itself felt more than all  the others put together, because as long as the secret of the cavern was  kept, in all our misfortunes we were never without resources; but from  the moment it got into the possession of our enemies we were quite  destitute. The country was ravaged, my friends had grown cold, their  purses were empty, a hundred towns had been sacked and burned, the  prisons were full of Protestants, the fields were uncultivated. Added to  all this, the long promised help from England had never arrived, and the  new marechal had appeared in the province accompanied by fresh troops.\"    Nevertheless, in spite of his desperate position, Cavalier listened to  the propositions laid before him by Lacombe with cold and haughty front,  and his reply was that he would never lay down arms till the Protestants  had obtained the right to the free exercise of their religion.    Firm as was this answer, Lalande did not despair of inducing Cavalier to  come to terms: he therefore wrote him a letter with his own hand, asking  him for an interview, and pledging his word that if they came to no  agreement Cavalier should be free to retire without any harm being done  him; but he added that, if he refused this request, he should regard him  as an enemy to peace, and responsible for all the blood which might be  shed in future.    This overture, made with a soldier's frankness, had a great effect on  Cavalier, and in order that neither his friends nor his enemies should  have the least excuse for blaming him, he resolved to show everyone that  he was eager to seize the first chance of making peace on advantageous  terms.    He therefore replied to Lalande, that he would come to the bridge of  Avene on that very day, the 12th May, at noon, and sent his letter by  Catinat, ordering him to deliver it into the hands of the Catholic  general himself.    Catinat was worthy of his mission. He was a peasant from Cayla, whose  real name was Abdias Maurel. He had served under Marshal Catinat in  Italy, the same who had maintained so gallant a struggle against Prince  Eugene. When Maurel returned home he could talk of nothing but his  marshal and his campaigns, so that he soon went among his neighbours by  the name of \"Catinat.\" He was, as we have seen, Cavalier's right hand,  who had placed him in command of his cavalry, and who now entrusted him  with a still more dangerous post, that of envoy to a man who had often  said that he would give 2000 livres to him who would bring him the head  of Cavalier, and 1000 livres each for the heads of his two lieutenants.  Catinat was quite well aware of this offer of Lalande's, yet he appeared  before the general perfectly cool and calm; only, either from a feeling  of propriety or of pride, he was dressed in full uniform.    The bold and haughty expression of the man who presented Cavalier's  letter astonished the general, who asked him his name.    \"I am Catinat,\" he answered.    \"Catinat!\" exclaimed Lalande in surprise.    \"Yes, Catinat, commander of the cavalry of Cavalier.\"    \"What!\" said Lalande, \"are you the Catinat who massacred so many people  in Beaucaire?\"    \"Yes, I am. I did it, but it was my duty.\"    \"Well,\" exclaimed M. de Lalande, \"you show great hardihood in daring to  appear before me.\"    \"I came,\" said Catinat proudly, \"trusting to your honour and to the  promise that Brother Cavalier gave me that nothing should happen to me.\"    \"He was quite right,\" returned Lalande, taking the letter. Having read  it, he said, \"Go back to Cavalier and assure him that I shall be at the  bridge of Avene at noon, accompanied only by a few officers and thirty  dragoons. I expect to find him there with a similar number of men.\"    \"But,\" answered Catinat, \"it is possible that Brother Cavalier may not  wish-to come with so poor a following.\"    \"If so,\" returned Lalande, \"then tell him that he may bring his whole  army if he likes, but that I shall not take a single man with me more  than I have said; as Cavalier has confidence in me, I have confidence in  him.\"    Catinat reported Lalande's answer to his chief it was of a kind that he  understood and liked, so leaving the rest of his troops at Massanes, he  chose sixty men from his infantry, and eight horsemen as escort. On  coming in sight of the bridge, he saw Lalande approaching from the other  side. He at once ordered his sixty men to halt, went a few steps farther  with his eight horsemen, and then ordered them in their turn to stop,  and advanced alone towards the bridge. Lalande had acted in the same  manner with regard to his dragoons and officers, and now dismounting,  came towards Cavalier.    The two met in the middle of the bridge, and saluted with the courtesy  of men who had learned to esteem each other on the field of battle. Then  after a short silence, during which they examined each other, Lalande  spoke.    \"Sir,\" said he, \"the king in his clemency desires to put an end to the  war which is going on between his subjects, and which can only result in  the ruin of his kingdom. As he knows that this war has been instigated  and supported by the enemies of France, he hopes to meet no opposition  to his wishes among those of his subjects who were momentarily led  astray, but"]]]
