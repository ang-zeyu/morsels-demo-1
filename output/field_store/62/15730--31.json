She played on  the grave-mounds during the long, bright summer days, crept about under  the branches of the elder bushes quietly and happily, and beneath the  clothes which her mother had hung up in long lines above the graves to  dry.    Soon autumn came with its long damp evenings. It became dark early, and  when Miriam was detained till a late hour, Lea used to wait for her  patiently in their little room. She knew that ere long she would hear  her mother's step outside, and her voice calling her as she opened the  door. She could then run into her arms, and a fire would soon be burning  to cook a warm supper.    But once, on a raw, cold September night, it was not so. The washerwoman  came home and called her child, but no answer came.    Trembling, she struck a light. The room was empty.    \"Lea!\" she cried again, loudly and sharply.    Still no answer. She let her hands fall helplessly at her sides.  Recovering herself quickly, she rushed into the room of her neighbor,  the gravedigger who had formerly been under her husband, and who had  succeeded to his place.    \"My child!\" she cried; \"where is my child?\"    The man and his wife stared at her as if she were mad.    \"How should we know?\" they at length answered, with hesitation.    \"She is gone! Oh, help me, help me!\" the mother cried in desperation, as  she turned and hurried out into the dark burial-ground.    The gravedigger's wife searched the highroad which leads toward the  town, while the man followed Miriam.    He distinguished her dark figure amongst the mounds and headstones, but  he was unable to over-take her. She was running wildly over every  obstacle, now stepping on a gravestone, and again stumbling over the  root of a tree, calling her child loudly as she ran. The man knew the  place well, and its terrors had become commonplace in his eyes; but  still his hair stood on end with fear, as he ran in the dark over the  graves, and the mother's despairing cry fell on his ears.    They both neared the spot where the burial-ground is bounded by the  deep, sluggish river Lered. \"The fence is broken,\" muttered the man, and  he tried not to follow up the thought that had occurred to him.    But fate had been merciful.    As they hastened along by the side of the fence, and Miriam, with an  almost failing voice, called her child, suddenly, from behind a  gravestone, a thin trembling voice answered--\"Mother!\"    The little girl had run about the whole day. When the dusk had surprised  her in this distant place, she had sat down and fallen asleep.    The child only half comprehended why her mother seized her hastily in  her arms, and pressed her to her breast, covering her little face with a  thousand kisses and tears.    Slowly Miriam carried her home, the gravedigger following and rejoicing,  while he shook his head, and murmured: \"It wouldn't have surprised me  had we found the child dead. Not at all! The Great Death is coming near  us again. They say that it has already reached the Turks!...\"    Miriam did not hear these strange words. She carried the child into her  little room, and put her in bed even more tenderly than usual, smoothing  her hair off her brow, and kissing her mouth again and again.    Then she visited her neighbors, and thanked them in woman's fashion, in  many words. After that, she returned to her own room, and thanked God  with a long silent look upward.    She could not sleep, so she crouched beside the bed, and watched her  sleeping child. But, heavens! what was the matter? The poor woman's  blood turned cold, for Lea's usually pale face was flushed with fever,  and she was breathing quickly and stertorously. Her hands and feet were  cold, and her head was burning hot.    \"Lea, are you ill?\" cried Miriam. \"Speak, my life!\"    Hearing her voice, the child opened her eyes, but they were no longer  lusterless. A strange unnatural light glowed in them. \"I am cold,\" she  lisped, drawing the bed-clothes about her.    \"She will die!...\" was Miriam's muttered thought, and she felt paralyzed  for the moment. Recovering herself, however, she took her thin shawl  from her shoulders, and her best gown from her box, and spread them over  the child. Lea's teeth were chattering. She shivered with cold, though  she seemed but half conscious.    Miriam once more hurried to her neighbors' room, and knocked at their  closed door. She wished to beg them to come and tell her what was the  matter with her child; for a Jewish gravedigger is required to visit the  sick as well as to bury the dead. When the doctor is not called in, the  gravedigger is sent for. But the man had gone to the town to keep the  night-watch over the body of rich Moses Freudenthal. His wife came,  however, and staid with the poor widow, in hopes of comforting her.    \"It is only a fever,\" she said, consolingly. \"The child has caught cold,  and it is only a common fever. See, burning heat follows a shivering  fit.\"    In fact, Lea's fever soon ran so high, that all her bed-clothes had to  be taken off. The women made a strong herb tea, but the child would not  drink it.    The terrible night passed very slowly.    In the morning, when the gravedigger came home from his sad vigil, he  went to see the sick child. On seeing her, he shook his head. The mother  wrung her hands in despair when she saw his gesture, and gave utterance  to a low moan. He pitied her, and said slowly: \"It isn't a dangerous  kind of fever. Lea will soon be well.\"    \"Tell me the truth,\" cried Miriam; \"but I shall send for the doctor  whether the illness is dangerous or not.\"    The gravedigger shrugged his shoulders. \"The doctor has been at the  muster at Zalesczyki for the last eight days. But even if he were  here.... No doctor can help the child!\"    \"Must she die?\" asked Miriam.    \"No _doctor_, I say,\" answered the gravedigger slowly, \"but a holy rabbi  might save her. Old Moses Freudenthal's funeral is to take place to-day,  and our rabbi is going to attend. Ask him to see the child, and bless  it. He is a holy man--perhaps he is strong enough to save it, and  perhaps he will give you advice.\"    So saying, he went away to prepare the grave. His wife followed him.    \"I may as well dig two graves,\" said he, as he struck his spade into the  ground.    \"You mean for the child?\" asked his wife. \"Poor Miriam--God spare  her!...\"    \"Yes,\" he answered, \"it makes my heart ache. But no man can save her.  They say that the Great Death is coming again. God will spare us. He  will only take the 'child of atonement' that we have delivered up to  Him.\"    \"In God's name,\" cried the woman, \"why should an innocent life be  taken.\"    The man shrugged his shoulders, and asked: \"Would you pretend to be more  holy than our holy rabbi? Are you more just than the great Reb Grolce,  the wonder-working rabbi of Sadagora, who has ordained it so?\"    The woman was silent.           *       *       *       *       *    What had the wonder-working rabbi ordained? And why did they call the  child a \"child of atonement\"?           *       *       *       *       *    ... Mysteriously, irresistibly, the destroying-angel of the Lord brought  an unknown plague into every land in the terrible year 1831. It was  called the cholera. It came from the far East, and spread onward to the  far West, devastating the towns, and filling the cemeteries. It fell  heavily on the dirty, poverty-stricken villages in the Podolian plain.  Countless numbers of the inhabitants died like flies, and enough were  not left to bury the dead. No remedies saved life; no precautions  protected it. Stolid resignation, or else angry desperation, possessed  the people. And God permitted all this misery, and from God no help  came! They called upon Him and He did not hear!...    Why? Why?    Was it not _their_ God whom they implored, the God of their fathers, the  almighty, the just, and the only God? Had He no longer ears to hear, or  arms to help? Why did He suddenly turn against His own people? Why did  He not protect the good and the just among them?    The minds of the unhappy people began to waver. They had but one beacon  to direct their lives--their faith; and their faith betrayed them. They  could not comprehend it.    Then another thought occurred to them--a fearful and crushing thought,  and yet it brought comfort. Was not their God a God of vengeance? Was He  not a jealous God, who exacted, for every offense, a fearful and  inexorable atonement? And now, when He caused the evil and the good to  suffer alike, was it not probably because the wicked sinned, and the  good allowed their sins to pass unpunished?    \"We will purify ourselves,\" the suffering people cried aloud in their  agony. \"We will seek the offender in our midst, and by his punishment we  will atone, and save ourselves from the wrath of God....\"    And they purified themselves....    A tribunal was formed by the people--an awful court, which tried in  secret, judged in secret, and punished in secret. It was stern and  inexorable in the execution of its decrees, and no one could escape from  it. It \"vindicated God's holy name,\" and caused the hour of retribution  to strike for many criminals who had evaded the laws. But with how much  innocent blood had these fanatics stained their hands! Deeds were done  in those dark days of madness and terror that chill the blood, and make  the historian, who attempts to describe them, falter.    The pestilence became more and more terrible. The few doctors that  remained folded their hands.    They could not alleviate the suffering of the people, far less could  they save their lives.    Men ceased to persecute each other for real or imaginary sins. The  growing burden of misfortune took away their spirit, and made them  faint-hearted. They even prayed no longer; a mediator had to pray for  them.    The intercessor they chose was the rabbi of Sadagora, a little town in  Bukowina. This man was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3462"],[0,"More Hunting Wasps (#20)"],[1,", closes and again opens her shears and  presents them threateningly at the enemy; using a privilege which no  other insect shares, she turns her head this way and that, as we do when  we look over our shoulders; she faces her assailant, ready to strike a  return blow wheresoever the attack may come. It is the first time that  I have witnessed such defensive daring. What will be the outcome of it  all?    The Wasp continues to oscillate behind the Mantis, in order to avoid the  formidable grappling-engine; then, suddenly, when she judges that the  other is baffled by the rapidity of her manoeuvres, she hurls herself  upon the insect's back, seizes its neck with her mandibles, winds her  legs round its thorax and hastily delivers a first thrust of the sting,  to the front, at the root of the lethal legs. Complete success! The  deadly shears fall powerless. The operator then lets herself slip as she  might slide down a pole, retreats along the Mantis' back and, going a  trifle lower, less than a finger's breadth, she stops and paralyses,  this time without hurrying herself, the two pairs of hind-legs. It is  done: the patient lies motionless; only the tarsi quiver, twitching in  their last convulsions. The sacrificer brushes her wings for a moment  and polishes her antennae by passing them through her mouth, an habitual  sign of tranquillity returning after the emotions of the conflict; she  seizes the game by the neck, takes it in her legs and flies away with  it.    What do you say to it all? Do not the scientist's theory and the  insect's practice agree most admirably? Has not the animal accomplished  to perfection what anatomy and physiology enabled us to foretell?  Instinct, a gratuitous attribute, an unconscious inspiration, rivals  knowledge, that most costly acquisition. What strikes me most is the  sudden recoil after the first thrust of the sting. The Hairy Ammophila,  operating on her caterpillar, likewise recoils, but progressively,  from one segment to the next. Her deliberate surgery might receive a  quasi-explanation if we ascribe it to a certain uniformity. With the  Tachytes and the Mantis this paltry argument escapes us. Here are  no lancet-pricks regularly distributed; on the contrary, the  operating-method betrays a lack of symmetry which would be  inconceivable, if the organization of the patient did not serve as a  guide. The Tachytes therefore knows where her prey's nerve-centres lie;  or, to speak more correctly, she behaves as though she knew.    This science which is unconscious of itself has not been acquired, by  her and by her race, through experiments perfected from age to age and  habits transmitted from one generation to the next. It is impossible,  I am prepared to declare a hundred times, a thousand times over, it is  absolutely impossible to experiment and to learn an art when you are  lost if you do not succeed at the first attempt. Don't talk to me of  atavism, of small successes increasing by inheritance, when the novice,  if he misdirected his weapon, would be crushed in the trap of the two  saws and fall a prey to the savage Mantis! The peaceable Locust, if  missed, protests against the attack with a few kicks; the carnivorous  Mantis, who is in the habit of feasting on Wasps far more powerful than  the Tachytes, would protest by eating the bungler; the game would devour  the hunter, an excellent catch. Mantis-paralysing is a most perilous  trade and admits of no half-successes; you have to excel in it from the  first, under pain of death. No, the surgical art of the Tachytes is not  an acquired art. Whence then does it come, if not from the universal  knowledge in which all things move and have their being!    What would happen if, in exchange for her Praying Mantis, I were to give  the Tachytes a young Grasshopper? In rearing insects at home, I have  already noted that the larvae put up very well with this diet; and I  am surprised that the mother does not follow the example of the Tarsal  Tachytes and provide her family with a skewerful of Locusts instead  of the risky prey which she selects. The diet would be practically the  same; and the terrible shears would no longer be a danger. With such a  patient would her operating-method remain the same; should we again  see a sudden recoil after the first stab under the neck; or would the  vivisector modify her art in conformity with the unfamiliar nervous  organization?    This second alternative is highly improbable. It would be nonsense to  expect to see the paralyser vary the number and the distribution of the  wounds according to the genus of the victim. Supremely skilled in the  task that has fallen to its lot, the insect knows nothing further.    The first alternative seems to offer a certain chance and deserves a  test. I offer the Tachytes, deprived of her Mantis, a small Grasshopper,  whose hind-legs I amputate to prevent his leaping. The disabled Acridian  jogs along the sand. The Wasp flies round him for a moment, casts a  contemptuous glance upon the cripple and withdraws without attempting  action. Let the prey offered be large or small, green or grey, short  or long, rather like the Mantis or quite different, all my efforts  miscarry. The Tachytes recognizes in an instant that this is no  business of hers; this is not her family game; she goes off without even  honouring my Grasshoppers with a peck of her mandibles.    This stubborn refusal is not due to gastronomical causes. I have stated  that the larvae reared by my own hands feed on young Grasshoppers as  readily as on young Mantes; they do not seem to perceive any difference  between the two dishes; they thrive equally on the game chosen by me  and that selected by the mother. If the mother sets no value on the  Grasshopper, what then can be the reason of her refusal? I can see only  one: this quarry, which is not hers, perhaps inspires her with fear, as  any unknown thing might do; the ferocious Mantis does not alarm her,  but the peaceable Grasshopper terrifies her. And then, if she were to  overcome her apprehensions, she does not know how to master the Acridian  and, above all, how to operate upon him. To every man his trade, to  every Wasp her own way of wielding her sting. Modify the conditions ever  so slightly; and these skilful paralysers are at an utter loss.    To every insect also its own art of fashioning the cocoon, an art which  varies greatly, an art in which the larva displays all the resources  of its instincts. The Tachytes, the Bembeces, the Stizi, the Palari and  other burrowers build composite cocoons, hard as fruit-stones, formed of  an encrustation of sand in a network of silk. We are already acquainted  with the work of the Bembex. I will recall the fact that their larva  first weaves a conical, horizontal bag of pure white silk, with wide  meshes, held in place by interlaced threads which fix it to the walls  of the cell. I have compared this bag, because of its shape, with a  fishtrap. Without leaving this hammock, stretching its neck through the  orifice, the worker gathers from without a little heap of sand, which  it stores inside its workshop. Then, selecting the grains one by one,  it encrusts them all around itself in the fabric of the bag and cements  them with the fluid from its spinnerets, which hardens at once. When  this task is finished, the house has still to be closed, for it has been  wide open all this time to permit of the renewal of the store of sand  as the heap inside becomes exhausted. For this purpose a cap of silk is  woven across the opening and finally encrusted with the materials which  the larva has retained at its disposal.    The Tachytes builds in quite another fashion, although its work, once  finished, does not differ from that of the Bembex. The larva surrounds  itself, to begin with, about the middle of its body with a silken girdle  which a number of threads, very irregularly distributed, hold in place  and connect with the walls of the cell. Sand is collected, within reach  of the worker, on this general scaffolding. Then begins the work of  minor masonry, with grains of sand for rubble and the secretion of the  spinnerets for cement. The first course is laid upon the fore-edge of  the suspensory ring. When the circle is completed, a second course of  grains of sand, stuck together by the fluid silk, is raised upon the  hardened edge of what has just been done. Thus the work proceeds,  by ring-shaped courses, laid edge to edge, until the cocoon, having  acquired half of its proper length, is rounded into a cap and finally is  closed. The building-methods of the Tachytes-larva remind me of a mason  constructing a round chimney, a narrow tower of which he occupies the  centre. Turning on his own axis and using the materials placed to his  hand, he encloses himself little by little in his sheath of masonry.  In the same way the worker encloses itself in its mosaic. To build the  second half of the cocoon, the larva turns round and builds in the same  way on the other edge of the original ring. In about thirty-six hours  the solid shell is completed.    I am rather interested to see the Bembex and the Tachytes, two workers  in the same guild, employ such different methods to achieve the same  result. The first begins by weaving an eel-trap of pure silk and next  encrusts the grains of sand inside; the second, a bolder architect, is  economical of the silk envelope, confines itself to a hanging girdle and  builds course by course. The building-materials are the same: sand and  silk; the surroundings amid which the two artisans work are the same: a  cell in a soil of sandy gravel; yet each of the builders possesses its  individual art, its own plan, its one method.    The nature of the food has no more effect upon the larva's talents than  the environment in which it lives or the materials employed. The proof  of this is furnished by Stiza ruficornis, another builder of cocoons in  grains of"]]]
