I knowed I never seen  that before, so I rides up, thinking it might be some of our stock, an'  seen it was a horse lying plumb flat. The wind was blowing like--from  him to me, so I rides up close and seen it was the Pacer, dead as a  mackerel. Still, he didn't look swelled or cut, and there wa'n't no  smell, an' I didn't know what to think till I seen his ear twitch off a  fly and then I knowed he was sleeping. I gits down me rope and coils it,  and seen it was old and pretty shaky in spots, and me saddle a single  cinch, an' me pony about 700 again a 1,200 lbs. stallion, an' I sez to  meself, sez I: 'Tain't no use, I'll only break me cinch and git throwed  an' lose me saddle.' So I hits the saddle-horn a crack with the hondu,  and I wish't you'd a seen that mustang. He lept six foot in the air an'  snorted like he was shunting cars. His eyes fairly bugged out an' he  lighted out lickety split for California, and he orter be there about  now if he kep' on like he started--and I swear he never made a break the  hull trip.\"    The story was not quite so consecutive as given here. It was much  punctuated by present engrossments, and from first to last was more or  less infiltrated through the necessaries of life, for Bill was a healthy  young man without a trace of false shame. But the account was complete  and everyone believed it, for Billy was known to be reliable. Of all  those who heard, old Turkeytrack talked the least and probably thought  the most, for it gave him a new idea.    During his after-dinner pipe he studied it out and deciding that he  could not go it alone, he took Horseshoe Billy into his council and the  result was a partnership in a new venture to capture the Pacer; that is,  the $5,000 that was now said to be the offer for him safe in a box-car.    Antelope Springs was still the usual watering-place of the Pacer. The  water being low left a broad belt of dry black mud between the sedge and  the spring. At two places this belt was broken by a well-marked trail  made by the animals coming to drink. Horses and wild animals usually  kept to these trails, though the horned cattle had no hesitation in  taking a short cut through the sedge.    In the most used of these trails the two men set to work with shovels  and dug a pit 15 feet long, 6 feet wide and 7 feet deep. It was a  hard twenty hours work for them as it had to be completed between  the Mustang's drinks, and it began to be very damp work before it was  finished. With poles, brush, and earth it was then cleverly covered over  and concealed. And the men went to a distance and hid in pits made for  the purpose.    About noon the Pacer came, alone now since the capture of his band.  The trail on the opposite side of the mud belt was little used, and old  Tom, by throwing some fresh rushes across it, expected to make sure  that the Stallion would enter by the other, if indeed he should by any  caprice try to come by the unusual path.    What sleepless angel is it watches over and cares for the wild animals?  In spite of all reasons to take the usual path, the Pacer came along the  other. The suspicious-looking rushes did not stop him; he walked calmly  to the water and drank. There was only one way now to prevent utter  failure; when he lowered his head for the second draft which horses  always take, Bates and Smith quit their holes and ran swiftly toward  the trail behind him, and when he raised his proud head Smith sent a  revolver shot into the ground behind him.    Away went the Pacer at his famous gait straight to the trap. Another  second and he would be into it. Already he is on the trail, and already  they feel they have him, but the Angel of the wild things is with him,  that incomprehensible warning comes, and with one mighty bound he clears  the fifteen feet of treacherous ground and spurns the earth as he fades  away unharmed, never again to visit Antelope Springs by either of the  beaten paths.    V    Wild Jo never lacked energy. He meant to catch that Mustang, and when he  learned that others were bestirring themselves for the same purpose  he at once set about trying the best untried plan he knew--the plan by  which the coyote catches the fleeter jackrabbit, and the mounted Indian  the far swifter antelope--the old plan of the relay chase.    The Canadian River on the south, its affluent, the Pinavetitos Arroyo,  on the northeast, and the Don Carlos Hills with the Ute Creek Canyon on  the west, formed a sixty-mile triangle that was the range of the Pacer.  It was believed that he never went outside this, and at all times  Antelope Springs was his headquarters.    Jo knew this country well, all the water-holes and canon crossings as  well as the ways of the Pacer.    If he could have gotten fifty good horses he could have posted them to  advantage so as to cover all points, but twenty mounts and five good  riders were all that proved available.    The horses, grain-fed for two weeks before, were sent on ahead; each man  was instructed how to play his part and sent to his post the day before  the race. On the day of the start Jo with his wagon drove to the plain  of Antelope Springs and, camping far off in a little draw, waited.    At last he came, that coal-black Horse, out from the sand-hills at the  south, alone as always now, and walked calmly down to the Springs and  circled quite around it to sniff for any hidden foe. Then he approached  where there was no trail at all and drank.    Jo watched and wished that he would drink a hogs-head. But the moment  that he turned and sought the grass Jo spurred his steed. The Pacer  heard the hoofs, then saw the running horse, and did not want a nearer  view but led away. Across the flat he went down to the south, and kept  the famous swinging gait that made his start grow longer. Now through  the sandy dunes he went, and steadying to an even pace he gained  considerably and Jo's too-laden horse plunged through the sand and  sinking fetlock deep, he lost at every bound. Then came a level stretch  where the runner seemed to gain, and then a long decline where Jo's  horse dared not run his best, so lost again at every step.    But on they went, and Jo spared neither spur nor quirt. A mile--a  mile--and another mile, and the far-off rock at Arriba loomed up ahead.    And there Jo knew fresh mounts were held, and on they dashed. But the  night-black mane out level on the breeze ahead was gaining more and  more.    Arriba Canon reached at last, the watcher stood aside, for it was not  wished to turn the race, and the Stallion passed--dashed down, across  and up the slope, with that unbroken pace, the only one he knew.    And Jo came bounding on his foaming steed, and on the waiting mount,  then urged him down the slope and up upon the track, and on the upland  once more drove in the spurs, and raced and raced, and raced, but not a  single inch he gained.    Ga-lump, ga-lump, ga-lump, with measured beat he went--an hour--an hour,  and another hour--Arroyo Alamosa just ahead with fresh relays, and Jo  yelled at his horse and pushed him on and on. Straight for the place the  Black One made, but on the last two miles some strange foreboding turned  him to the left, and Jo foresaw escape in this, and pushed his jaded  mount at any cost to head him off, and hard as they had raced this was  the hardest race of all, with gasps for breath and leather squeaks at  every straining bound. Then cutting right across, Jo seemed to gain, and  drawing his gun he fired shot after shot to toss the dust, and so turned  the Stallion's head and forced him back to take the crossing to the  right.    Down they went. The Stallion crossed and Jo sprang to the ground. His  horse was done, for thirty miles had passed in the last stretch, and Jo  himself was worn out. His eyes were burnt with flying alkali dust. He  was half blind so he motioned to his 'pard' to \"go ahead and keep him  straight for Alamosa ford.\"    Out shot the rider on a strong, fresh steed, and away they went--up and  down on the rolling plain--the Black Horse flecked with snowy foam.  His heaving ribs and noisy breath showed what he felt--but on and on he  Went.    And Tom on Ginger seemed to gain, then lose and lose, when in an hour  the long decline of Alamosa came.    And there a freshly mounted lad took up the chase and turned it west,  and on they went past towns of prairie dogs, through soapweed tracts and  cactus brakes by scores, and pricked and wrenched rode on. With dust and  sweat the Black was now a dappled brown, but still he stepped the same.  Young Carrington, who followed, bad hurt his steed by pushing at the  very start, and spurred and urged him now to cut across a gulch at which  the Pacer shied. Just one misstep and down they went.    The boy escaped, but the pony lies there yet, and the wild Black Horse  kept on.    This was close to old Gallego's ranch where Jo himself had cut across  refreshed to push the chase. Within thirty minutes he was again  scorching the Pacer's trail.    Far in the west the Carlos Hills were seen, and there Jo knew fresh men  and mounts were waiting, and that way the indomitable rider tried  to turn, the race, but by a sudden whim, of the inner warning born  perhaps--the Pacer turned. Sharp to the north he went, and Jo, the  skilful wrangler, rode and rode and yelled and tossed the dust with  shots, but down on a gulch the wild black meteor streamed and Jo  could only follow. Then came the hardest race of all; Jo, cruel to the  Mustang, was crueller to his mount and to himself. The sun was hot, the  scorching plain was dim in shimmering heat, his eyes and lips were burnt  with sand and salt, and yet the chase sped on. The only chance to win  would be if he could drive the Mustang back to the Big Arroyo Crossing.  Now almost for the first time he saw signs of weakening in the Black.  His mane and tail were not just quite so high, and his short half mile  of start was down by"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30310"],[0,"Special Report on Diseases of Cattle (#20)"],[1,"from the veins; the  auriculo-ventricular orifices being widely open, the ventricles also  receive blood; the auricles contract and the ventricles are filled;  contraction of the ventricles follows; the auriculo-ventricular valves are  forced up by the pressure of the blood and close the auriculo-ventricular  openings and prevent the return of blood into the auricles; the contraction  of the ventricles forces the blood from the right ventricle into the lungs  through the pulmonary artery and its branches, and from the left ventricle  into the aorta, thence through the arteries to all parts of the body. After  the contraction of the ventricles the heart is again in momentary repose  and is being filled with blood, while the valves in the aorta and pulmonary  artery close to prevent the return of blood into the ventricles. (See Pl.  VII.)    The average weight of the heart of an ox is said to be from 3-1/2 to 5  pounds; but, of course, owing to the many breeds and sizes of cattle, it  must vary in different animals.    The vessels that convey the blood from the heart to all parts of the body  are called arteries; those which return the blood to the heart are called  veins. The arteries divide and subdivide (like the branches of a tree),  become smaller and smaller, and ultimately ramify into every part of the  body. Between the ultimate ramifications of the arteries and the beginning  of the veins there is an intermediate system of very minute vessels called  capillaries, which connect the arterial with the venous system of the  circulation. The walls of the arteries are possessed of a certain amount of  rigidity, sufficient to keep the tubes open when they are empty.    The blood leaves the left ventricle through a single vessel, the common  aorta, consisting of the anterior and posterior aortas, which give off the  large arteries.    The veins take the blood from the capillaries in all parts of the body.  They begin in very small tubes, which unite to become larger in size and  less in number as they approach the heart.    In its course an artery is usually accompanied with a vein and in many  situations with a nerve. The more important arteries are placed deep within  the body; when they are superficial, however, they are generally found  where least exposed to injury, as, for example, on the inner side of the  legs. Arteries are less numerous than veins, and their total capacity is  much less than that of the veins. A great number of veins are in the tissue  immediately beneath the skin and do not generally accompany arteries.    The blood, throughout its course in the heart, arteries, capillaries, and  veins, is inclosed within these vessels. Except where the large lymphatics  empty into the venous blood, there is no opening into the course of the  blood.    All the arteries except the pulmonary and its branches carry bright-red  blood, and all the veins, except the pulmonary veins, carry dark-red blood.  The impure dark-red blood is collected from the capillary vessels and  carried to the right auricle by the veins; it passes down into the right  ventricle, and thence into the pulmonary artery and through its branches to  the capillaries of the lungs, where the carbonic-acid gas and other  impurities are given up to the air in the air cells of the lungs (through  the thin walls between the capillaries and the air cells), and where it  also absorbs from the air the oxygen gas necessary to sustain life. This  gas changes it to the bright-red, pure blood. It passes from the  capillaries to the branches of the pulmonary veins, which convey it to the  left auricle of the heart; it then passes through the auriculo-ventricular  opening into the left ventricle, the contraction of which forces it through  the common aorta into the posterior and anterior aortas, and through all  the arteries of the body into the capillaries, where it parts with its  oxygen and nutritive elements and where it absorbs carbonic-acid gas and  becomes dark colored. (See theoretical diagram of the circulation, Pl.  VII.)    The branches of certain arteries in different parts unite again after  subdividing. This reuniting is called anastomosing, and assures a quota of  blood to a part if one of the anastomosing arteries should be tied in case  of hemorrhage, or should be destroyed by accident or operation.      THE BLOOD.    The various kinds of food, after being digested in the alimentary canal,  are absorbed and carried into the blood by the lymphatics, and by the blood  to the places where nutrition is required. The blood takes from all parts  of the body all that is no longer required, and carries it to the different  organs through which it is eliminated from the body. It contains within  itself all the elements which nourish the body.    The blood may be considered as a fluid holding in solution certain  inorganic elements and having certain bodies suspended in it. To facilitate  description, the blood may be considered as made up of the corpuscles and  the liquor sanguinis. The corpuscles are of two kinds, the red and the  white, the red being the more numerous. The color of the blood is caused by  the coloring matter in the red corpuscles, which are the oxygen carriers.  Both kinds are very minute bodies, which require the aid of the microscope  to recognize them. The liquor sanguinis is composed of water containing in  solution salts, albumen, and the elements of fibrin.    The lymphatics, or absorbents, are the vessels which carry the lymph and  chyle in the blood. They begin as capillaries in all parts of the body,  gradually uniting to form larger trunks. Placed along the course of the  lymphatic vessels are glands, in some situations collected into groups; for  example, in the groin. These glands are often involved in inflammation  arising from the absorption of deleterious matter.    Absorption is the function of the lymphatics. The liquor sanguinis passes  from the blood capillaries to supply nutrition to the tissues. All of the  liquor sanguinis that is not required is absorbed by the lymphatic vessels  and conveyed back to the blood by the lymphatic ducts. The lymphatics which  proceed from the intestines convey the chyle into the blood during  digestion. As a rule, the lymphatic vessels follow the course of the veins.  All the absorbent vessels convey their contents to the thoracic duct and  right great lymphatic vein, which empty into the anterior vena cava, where  the lymph and chyle mix with the venous blood, and thus maintain the supply  of nutritive elements in the blood.      THE PULSE.    As fully explained, the heart pumps the blood throughout the arterial  system. The arteries are always full and each contraction of the ventricle  pumps more blood into them; this distends their elastic walls and sends  along them a wave which gradually becomes less perceptible as it nears the  very small arteries. This wave constitutes the pulse, and is lost before  the capillaries are reached. The sensation or impression given to the  finger when placed upon the artery shows the force exerted by the heart and  some important facts concerning the condition of the circulation. In adult  cattle the average number of pulsations in a minute is from 50 to 60. The  pulse is faster than normal after exercise, excitement, on hot days, from  pain, and as a result of fullness of the stomach. In old animals it is  slower than in the young and in males slightly slower than in females. In  fevers and inflammations and in local diseases of the heart the pulse rate  is increased. If the rate is greater than 100 or 110 to the minute the  outlook for recovery is not good.    Other variations of the pulse are known as infrequent pulse, which means  that the number of pulsations in a given time is less than normal. The  irregular or the intermittent pulse is when the pulsations do not follow in  regular order. The large pulse and the small pulse refer to the volume of  the pulse, which may be larger or smaller than usual. The strong pulse and  the feeble pulse refer to the strength or weakness of the pulsation. The  pulse is said to be hard when the vessel feels hard and incompressible, the  soft pulse being the opposite. By dicrotic pulse is meant that kind of  pulsation which makes each beat seem double, and therefore it is generally  called the double pulse.    The venous or \"jugular pulse\" is the pulsation so frequently observed in  the jugular vein of cattle and is particularly noticeable while they are  ruminating--\"chewing the cud.\" It is not always associated with disease,  but may be a symptom of some disease of the heart; in such cases the  jugular pulse is continuous.    The place selected for feeling the pulse in cattle is where the  submaxillary artery winds around the lower jawbones, just at the lower edge  of the flat muscle on the side of the cheek; or, if the cow is lying down,  the metacarpal artery on the back part of the fore fetlock is very  convenient for the purpose.      THE EXAMINATION OF THE HEART.    Corresponding to the beats of the heart two sounds are emitted which are of  a definite type in healthy animals. The first is produced by the  contraction of the heart and the flow of blood out of it; the second is  caused by the rebound of blood in the aorta and the closure of the valves  that prevent it from flowing backward into the heart, whence it came. The  first sound is the longer and louder of the two, though of low pitch. The  second sound is sharper and shorter, and is not always easy to hear. There  is a brief interval between them.    To distinguish these sounds, the ear is placed against the left side of the  chest, a little above the point where the elbow rests when the animal is  standing in a natural position, and about opposite the sixth rib. Both  heart sounds are reduced in intensity when the animal is weak or when the  heart is forced away from the chest wall by collections of fluid or"]]]
