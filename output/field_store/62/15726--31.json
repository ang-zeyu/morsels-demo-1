[Illustration: Fig. 116. Group of houses on a Petaluma egg farm.  (Photograph from Bureau of Animal Industry, United States Department of  Agriculture)]      INTENSIVE EGG FARMING    Still another important development due to artificial incubation took  place in California. The climate of the Pacific Coast is well suited to  fowls of the Mediterranean class, the cold never being severe enough to  affect their large combs. Hence these fowls early became very popular  with farmers in this section, but as they were non-sitters, those who  kept them had to keep hens of another breed to hatch and rear the  chickens. When an incubator factory was established at Petaluma,  California, the farmers in that vicinity began to use incubators, and  some small egg farms grew up in the town. White Leghorns were kept  almost exclusively. Before long the egg industry here had grown to such  proportions that it was the most important local industry, and the  district became celebrated as a center of egg production. Although the  product is different, and a different type of fowl is used, the  conditions at Petaluma closely resemble those in the roaster-growing  district of Massachusetts. The special egg farms are small, each  containing from five to ten acres. The houses for the laying hens are  larger than the colony houses used in Rhode Island, and are arranged in  groups of three, each group containing about five hundred hens.    The egg farmers grow their own pullets but, as a rule, do not breed or  hatch them. The hatching is done by custom hatcheries, the eggs coming  from flocks of White Leghorns on farms that do not specialize in poultry  but keep a flock of Leghorns under more favorable conditions than exist  on the egg farms. Here, as in the Massachusetts district, the bad  effects of intensive methods are reduced for a time, because the fowls  affected by them are not used for reproduction.      POULTRY FANCIERS' FARMS    A large proportion of poultry fanciers are city people who have very  little room for their fowls. Some have no room at all for growing  chickens, although, by giving them the best of care, they can keep a  small flock of adult birds in fair condition. Such fanciers have to find  farmers to grow chickens for them. This is not so easy as is commonly  supposed, for the farmers who are sufficiently interested in poultry to  give them the care required to make good exhibition birds usually want  to give their own birds all the time they can spare for work with  poultry.    [Illustration: Fig. 117. Yards of a small poultry fancier]    So it happens that, after a few years' experience in keeping fine fowls  in close quarters, an amateur fancier almost always wants to move to a  farm where he can grow more and better chickens. A small farm near a  city suits the average fancier best, because, when so situated, he can  continue his regular work and look after his poultry in leisure time.  Fanciers generally use houses with many pens under one roof, because,  even when they have only one variety, the different matings must be kept  separate during the breeding season, the adult males must be kept  separate at all times, and valuable hens cannot be kept in large flocks  except when damage to plumage may be remedied before they are to be  exhibited or sold. A fancier will keep only five or six birds, and  sometimes only two or three, where a utility poultry keeper would keep a  dozen. If the yards connecting with the pens in the houses are small, he  will arrange so that each lot of fowls may have access to a large yard  daily or on alternate days. In every way practicable the experienced  fancier arranges to give his fowls all the advantages of natural  conditions, while isolating them as completely as is necessary to keep  each individual in perfect condition.    [Illustration: Fig. 118. Large fancy-poultry farm]    Poultry farms that were started as intensive market-poultry or egg farms  are sometimes converted into fancy-poultry farms. This is very likely to  be the case if thoroughbred stock is used and the owner becomes skillful  as a breeder. If he can breed fowls of a quality to command high prices,  he may be able to produce enough of them on a small farm to make a very  good living, when it would be very much harder, or perhaps impossible,  to make the farm profitable with ordinary stock.    [Illustration: Fig. 119. Growing chicks in a fancier's yard]    [Illustration: Fig. 120. Young stock in cornfield on a fancier's farm]    While farmers usually care more for horses, cattle, sheep, and hogs,  many become interested in poultry, and if they are natural fanciers and  good business men, it often happens that the growing of fancy poultry  becomes one of the most important industries on the farm. Many women on  farms become interested in fancy poultry, and some become very skillful  breeders and exhibitors. A farmer-fancier's poultry plant is usually a  combination of extensive and intensive methods. Some buildings with  small compartments must be provided, but all except the choicest birds  can be managed just like the ordinary fowls on a farm where  arrangements are made with a view to giving them the full advantage of  the good conditions which the place affords.    [Illustration: Fig. 121. Summer quarters for poultry. (Photograph from  New York State Agricultural College at Cornell University)]    To a novice in fancy-poultry culture the number of chickens grown by  expert fanciers seems very small for the equipment and the land used,  but the old fancier has learned in the costly school of competition, by  the bitter experience of defeat, that in growing exhibition poultry it  pays to give the birds a great deal more room, both indoors and  outdoors, than is needed simply to get quick growth and good size.  Elegance of form, depth and brilliance of color, and the indefinable  qualities of style and finish that distinguish the high-class exhibition  fowl are obtained in a much larger proportion of birds when they are  given a great deal more room than they apparently need.          CHAPTER VI    DUCKS      Ducks rank next to fowls in economic importance. If there were no fowls,  domestic ducks would probably be as numerous as fowls are now, for it is  much easier to produce eggs and meat from ducks than from any known  species of gallinaceous bird except the fowl. To most people who are not  accustomed to eating them, neither the flesh nor the eggs of ducks seem  quite as palatable as the flesh and eggs of fowls. On the other hand,  people accustomed to eating fat ducks and the eggs of ducks, which  contain a much higher percentage of fat than hens' eggs, often consider  the flesh and eggs of fowls rather insipid. The feathers of ducks are  more valuable commercially than those of fowls but are not  correspondingly profitable to the producer, because ducks are much  harder to pluck.    =Description.= Common ducks are about the same size as common fowls. The  improved breeds vary greatly in size but do not present such extremes of  size and diversity of form as are found in the races of fowls. As the  duck in a state of nature lives much upon the water, its form is at  nearly every point different from the typical form of the fowl. The duck  is usually described as boat-shaped, but, while this is a good  description, it would be more correct to say that a boat is duck-shaped.  The duck was the natural model for the first builders of boats.    The bills of ducks are large, rather flat, and broad at the tip. The  species to which most of our domestic ducks belong has no head ornaments  corresponding to the comb and wattles of the fowl. There is one variety  of this species which has a topknot, or crest. The Muscovy Duck, which  is of a different species, has a bare face with a carunculated red skin.  The plumage of ducks is very soft and dense, forming a thick covering  which, when the feathers are in a natural position, is impenetrable to  water and so perfect a protection from wind and cold that hardy ducks  are quite indifferent to keen winds and low temperatures, and, if left  to themselves, rarely seek shelter in winter. During a heavy snowfall  they will get under cover to escape being buried in the snow. At other  times they seem quite as comfortable on snow and ice as on the ground.  One of the most interesting sights of the poultry yard is to see a duck  sit down on the snow or ice when the temperature is below zero, draw up  its feet and work them into the feathers at the side of its body until  they are completely covered, tuck its bill into the feathers of its back  until only the nostrils and a little of the base of the bill are  exposed, and remain this way through the coldest nights rather than go a  few feet to a comfortable house with warm bedding on the floor. Being  better adapted to cold than fowls, they are, as would be expected, much  more susceptible to heat and suffer greatly in hot summer weather if  exposed to the sun or kept where there is not a good circulation of air.    The tails of ducks are short, spread laterally, and are usually folded  close and carried with the tip a little higher than the base. The legs  are very short, comparatively slender, and weak. Most ducks walk  awkwardly and fall down and flounder about helplessly when they try to  run. The legs of a duck are so weak that it is not safe to catch or  handle them by the legs, as fowls are usually caught and handled. It is  very easy to break or dislocate the leg of a duck in this way. Hence,  the usual method is to catch and carry them by the neck, which is very  strong. Most persons who are not used to handling ducks are afraid of  choking them by grasping the neck firmly, but there is very little  danger of this. The feet of a duck are webbed between the forward toes,  which makes them more serviceable"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34479"],[0,"The History of Painting in Italy, Vol. 1 (of 6) (#20)"],[1,"to the painter. He is celebrated by  Pascoli,[68] and by authors of greater note, as the father of  perspective. Brunelleschi was the first Florentine who saw the method of  bringing it to perfection, \"which consisted in drawing it in outline by  the help of intersections;\"[69] and in this manner he drew the square of  St. John, and other places, with true diminution and with receding  points. He was imitated in mosaic by Benedetto da Maiano, and in  painting by Masaccio, to both of whom he was master. About the same  period Paolo Uccello, having studied under Gio. Manetti, a celebrated  mathematician, applied to it with assiduity; and even so dedicated  himself to the pursuit, that in labouring to excel in this, he never  acquired celebrity in the other branches of painting. He delighted in it  far beyond his other studies, and used to say that perspective was the  most pleasant of all; so true is it that novelty is a great source of  enjoyment. He executed no work that did not reflect some new light on  that art, whether it consisted of edifices and colonnades, in which a  great space was represented in a small compass, or of figures  foreshortened with a skill unknown to the followers of Giotto. Some of  his historic pictures of Adam, and of Noah, in which he indulged in his  favourite taste for the novel and whimsical, remain in the cloisters of  S. Maria Novella; and there are also landscapes with trees and animals  so well executed, that he might be called the Bassano of the first age.  He particularly delighted to have birds in his house, from which he  drew, and from thence he obtained his surname of Uccello. In the  cathedral there is a gigantic portrait of Gio. Aguto on horseback,  painted by Paolo in green earth. This was, perhaps, the first attempt  made in painting, which achieved a great deal without appearing too  daring. He produced other specimens at Padua, where he delineated some  figures of giants with green earth in the house of the Vitali. He was  chiefly employed in ornamenting furniture for private individuals; the  triumphs of Petrarch in the royal gallery, painted on small cabinets are  supposed by some good judges to be his.    Masolino da Panicale cultivated the art of chiaroscuro. I believe he  derived advantage from having long dedicated his attention to modelling  and sculpture, a practice which renders relief easy to the painter,  beyond what is generally conceived. Ghiberti had been his master in this  branch, who at this time was unrivalled in design, in composition, and  in giving animation to his figures. Colouring, which he yet wanted, was  taught him by Starnina, and in this also he became a very celebrated  master. Thus uniting in himself the excellences of two schools, he  produced a new style, not indeed exempt from dryness, nor wholly  faultless; but grand, determined, and harmonious, beyond any former  example. The chapel of St. Peter al Carmine, is a remaining monument of  this artist. He there painted the Evangelists, and some acts of the  Saint, as his vocation to the apostleship, the tempest, the denying of  Christ, the miracle performed at Porta Speciosa, and the Preaching. He  was prevented by death from representing other acts of St. Peter, as for  instance, the tribute paid to Caesar, baptism conferred on the multitude,  the healing of the sick, which several years afterwards were painted by  his scholar Maso di S. Giovanni, a youth who obtained the surname of  Masaccio, from trusting to a precarious subsistence, and living, as it  was said, by chance, while deeply engrossed with the studies of his  profession. This artist was a genius calculated to mark an era in  painting; and Mengs has assigned him the highest place among those who  explored its untried recesses. Vasari informs us that \"what was executed  before his time might be called paintings, but that his pictures seem to  live, they are so true and natural;\" and in another place adds, that \"no  master of that age so nearly approached the moderns.\" He had formed the  principles of his art on the works of Ghiberti and Donatello;  perspective he acquired from Brunelleschi, and on going to Rome it  cannot be doubted that he improved by the study of ancient sculpture. He  there met with two senior artists, Gentile da Fabriano, and Vittore  Pisanello, upon whom high encomiums, as the first painter of his time,  may be seen in Maffei and elsewhere.[70] They who write thus had either  not seen any of the paintings of Masaccio, or at most only his early  productions; such as the S. Anna in the church of S. Ambrose in  Florence, or the chapel of S. Catherine in S. Clement's at Rome, in  which, while still young, he executed some pictures of the passion of  Christ, and legends of S. Anna, to which may be added a ceiling  containing the Evangelists, which are all that now remain free from  retouching. This work is excellent for that time, but some doubt whether  it ought to be ascribed to him; and it is inferior to his painting in  the Carmine, of which we may say with Pliny, _jam perfecta sunt omnia_.  The positions and foreshortenings of the figures are diversified and  complete beyond those practised by Paolo Uccello. The air of the heads,  says Mengs, is in the style of Raffaello; the expression is so managed  that the mind seems no less forcibly depicted than the body. The anatomy  of the figure is marked with truth and judgment. That figure, so highly  extolled in the baptism of S. Peter, which appears shivering with cold,  marks, as it were, an era in the art. The garments, divested of  minuteness, present a few easy folds. The colouring is true, properly  varied, delicate, and surprisingly harmonious; the relief is in the  grandest style. This chapel was not finished by him. He died in 1443,  not without suspicion of poison, and left it still deficient in several  pictures, which, after many years were supplied by the younger Lippi. It  became the school of all the best Florentine artists whom we shall have  occasion to notice in this and the succeeding epoch, of Pietro Perugino,  and even of Raffaello; and it is a curious circumstance, that in the  course of many years, in a city fruitful in genius, ever bent on the  promotion of the art, no one in following the footsteps of Masaccio  attained that eminence which he acquired without a director. Time has  defaced other works of his hand at Florence, equally commended, and  especially the sanctuary of the church del Carmine, of which there is a  drawing in the possession of the learned P. Lettor Fontana Barnabita in  Pavia. The royal gallery has very few of his works. The portrait of a  young man, that seems to breathe, and is estimated at a high price, is  in the Pitti collection.    After Masaccio, two monks distinguished themselves in the Florentine  school. The first was a Dominican friar named F. Giovanni da Fiesole, or  B. Giovanni Angelico. His first employment was that of ornamenting books  with miniatures, an art he learned from an elder brother, who executed  miniatures and other paintings. It is said that he studied in the chapel  of Masaccio, but it is not easy to credit this when we consider their  ages. Their style too betrays a different origin. The works of the friar  discover some traces of the manner of Giotto, in the posture of the  figures and the compensation for deficiencies in the art, not to mention  the drapery which is often folded in long tube-like forms, and the  exquisite diligence in minute particulars common to miniature painters.  Nor did he depart much from this method in the greatest part of his  works, which chiefly consist of scripture pieces of our Saviour, or the  Virgin, in cabinet pictures not unfrequently to be met with in Florence.  The royal gallery possesses several; the most brilliant and highly  finished of which, is the birth of John the Baptist. The Glory,[71]  which is in the church of S. Mary Magdalen de' Pazzi, from its great  size, is among his rarest productions; and it also ranks with the most  beautiful. His chief excellence consists in the beauty that adorns the  countenances of his saints and angels; and he is truly the Guido of the  age, for the sweetness of his colours, which, though in water, he  diluted and blended in a manner which almost reaches perfection. He was  also esteemed one of the best of his age in works executed in fresco;  and he was employed in the decoration of the cathedral of Orvieto, as  well as the palace of the Vatican itself, where he painted a chapel--a  work much commended by a number of writers. Vasari enumerates Gentile da  Fabriano among his disciples, but the dates render this impossible; and  says the same of Zanobi Strozzi, a man of noble origin, of whom I do not  know that any certain picture exists in a public collection: I only know  that, treading in the steps of his master, he surpassed the reputation  of a mere amateur. Benozzo Gozzoli, another of his disciples, and an  imitator of Masaccio, raised himself far above the majority of his  contemporaries.    In a few points he even surpassed his model, as in the stupendous size  of his edifices, in the amenity of his landscapes, and in the brilliancy  of his fancy, truly lively, agreeable, and picturesque. In the Riccardi  palace, once a royal residence, there is a chapel in good preservation,  where he executed a Glory, a Nativity, and an Epiphany. He there painted  with a profusion of gold and of drapery, unexampled, perhaps, in fresco;  and with an adherence to nature that exhibits an image of that age in  the portraits, the garments, the accoutrements of the horses, and in the  most minute particulars. He long resided at Pisa, and died there, where  he ought to be studied; for his compositions in that place are better  than those at Florence, and he was there also more sparing in the use of  gold. The portrait of S. Thomas Aquinas is highly spoken of by Vasari  and Richardson; but they especially"]]]
