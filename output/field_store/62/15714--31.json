Tyrrell, 1897: 165).    During the big movement of the last week of August, 1947, I may have  seen as many as 500 Caribou on one or two days, in herds numbering up to  150 individuals. A striking proportion of those observed seemed to occur  in bands of roughly 25 animals. On August 25 Fred Schweder, Jr.,  reported about a thousand crossing Little River, in bands of as many as  100 individuals. On October 11 Charles Schweder observed a thousand  Caribou resting on a hill 3 miles long in the vicinity of Four-hill  Creek. In November he found thousands, in herds up to 300 strong, moving  south from the upper Kazan River. These figures may give a faintly  approximate idea of the numbers occurring in the general region of  Nueltin Lake in a year considered less good than an average one. On the  other hand, toward the coast of Hudson Bay, there were reports of a  greater number of autumn migrants than in ordinary years.    In October, about 1944, tracks indicated that 2,000 or 3,000 animals had  crossed Windy River in the vicinity of Four-hill Creek in the night  (_fide_ Charles Schweder). About October 10, 1946 (a year of unusual  abundance), Fred Schweder, Jr., witnessed the passage of thousands in  one day in this vicinity; he got the impression of \"the hills moving  with Deer.\" (Yet this was the season when the Caribou passed mainly to  one side of the upper Kazan River, so that nearly one-third of the local  band of Eskimos starved to death.) In the first part of May, about 1942  or 1943, John Ingebrigtsen came to a nameless lake, about half a mile by  a mile and a half in extent, somewhere east of Duck Lake, Manitoba. It  appeared \"absolutely full of Caribou,\" and he estimated their number at  not less than 20,000. This would mean a density of no more than about 50  per acre.      _References._--Jones, 1899: 368, 374; J. B.

GENERAL HABITS      _Daily periods of activity and rest_    According to Charles Schweder, the Caribou do not move about much at  night; that seems to be their principal time for sleep. They exhibit a  definite tendency to pause and rest also toward the middle of the day.  Several instances have already been given of the animals resting at such  a time on frozen lakes and rivers: lakes southwest of Reindeer Lake,  March 18; lakes south of Lake Athabaska, April 16; Seal River, May 31;  Windy Bay, June 6 (mid-morning). Open hilltops are evidently sought  likewise for both nocturnal and mid-day rests: knoll by Windy River,  June 3; Josie's Hill, June 20; ridge by Little River, August 24 (about 9  a.m.). (For details, see sections on _Winter range_, _Spring migration_,  and _Fall migration_.)    Although we noted a small band of Caribou passing through a thick and  extensive stand of spruce at dusk on October 2, Fred Schweder, Jr.,  remarked that they do not rest in such a place; they are safer from  Wolves in open areas. Charles Schweder reported about 50 Caribou, in  three slightly separated bands, appearing on the south side of Windy  River near Four-hill Creek during the evening of September 24, but not  making up their minds to cross; he thought they might have been scared  by Wolves. Possibly there was a similar explanation for the crossing of  the river at this point by large numbers of the animals during an  October night several years previously.    According to Fred Schweder, Jr., a day's movement of Caribou past the  mouths of Little and Windy rivers during the fall migration generally  does not commence before 10 a.m. and ends about 3 p.m. The explanation  of such a phenomenon is none too obvious; and in any event, there were  exceptions enough, though the general statement may hold true for the  bulk of the migrants. As remarked in the section on _Spring migration_,  the daily periods when the Caribou crossed the ice of Windy Bay were  mainly from 10 to 11 a.m., from 2:30 to 5 p.m., and in the evening.    On August 27, about 5:50 p.m., a majority (say half a dozen) of a small  band of Caribou were lying down on a slope near the mouth of Little  River. They faced down wind to watch for enemies in that direction,  while their noses would warn them of any approaching from the opposite  direction. Their attitude was very much like that of Norway Reindeer  figured by Seton (1929, +3+: pls. 11, 15, 18).    Charles Schweder spoke of having seen whole herds lying down to rest,  while none of the animals remained standing up on guard. He had noted  one such herd of 600 or 700 along the Thlewiaza River in August. He  further stated that when the Caribou lie down to rest and to chew the  cud, they hold the head up. They may also sleep in this position. In the  hard winter of 1944-45, when the snow was deep and the animals were  tired and hungry, he came up to a resting herd. All but one of them got  up and moved away. That one remained sleeping, head up and eyes closed;  Charles walked up to within 10 feet and shot it. He has also seen  resting Caribou lay their heads down on the side, but only for a few  moments at a time.      _References._--J. B. Tyrrell, 1892: 129; Jones, 1899: 359;    Harper, 1949: 227; Banfield, 1951a: 23.      _Organization of herds_    The Barren Ground Caribou is a distinctly gregarious species. It goes in  herds for at least the greater part of the year; this is especially true  of the spring and autumn migration periods and of the winter months. We  know comparatively little of the behavior of the does at fawning time in  June; but probably there is a tendency toward solitariness on their part  at that season. It is true that solitary Caribou may be met with at  almost any season of the year; but this doubtless represents merely  temporary rather than permanent segregation of such individuals. At the  very end of the spring migration and at the beginning of the autumn  migration, there may be, among the sparse southernmost elements of the  population, a larger proportion of solitary animals.    While marching over the Barrens and feeding as they go, the smaller  bands maintain a fairly loose organization, as apparently best suiting  their needs. On the other hand, the huge herds of former times, such as  the Tyrrells met on the upper Dubawnt in 1893 (J. B. Tyrrell, 1897:  49-50, pl. 1; J. W. Tyrrell, 1908: pls. facing pp. 80, 81; Seton, 1929,  +3+: pl. 22), obviously maintained very compact ranks. In my limited  experience, the animals bunched more closely in crossing the rivers than  was normally the case on land among feeding herds. While swimming, they  would follow each other in files at minimum intervals; but in stepping  across rapids they might extend these intervals somewhat.    When merely covering ground, without stopping to feed, or when following  a trail through brush or along a narrow ridge, there is a strong  tendency for the animals to go in a single file, or at least in a  procession many times longer than wide. This was also apparent when they  were crossing the ice of Windy Bay in June.    When Caribou flee from some source of alarm, a distinct tendency toward  compact bunching may be observed. This may have been developed as a  measure of protection from pursuing Wolves; the latter could naturally  overcome a straggling or isolated individual more readily than one in a  compact herd. The Caribou running away from the train in the \"Little  Barrens\" south of Churchill very clearly demonstrated the tendency  toward a close formation. (See also, in the section on _Disposition_,  the account of a herd attacked by a hunter near Lake Charles.)    The larger herds of the autumn migration seemed to be generally composed  of all sexes and ages; yet some sizable bands were made up chiefly of  bucks on the one hand, or of does and fawns on the other hand. The rear  guard of the spring migration and the vanguard of the autumn migration  are generally composed of bucks, traveling either singly or in small  bands; this state of affairs is looked upon as evidence that the  majority of the bucks do not advance so far to the north in June and  July as the does do.    The following are a few examples of the composition and leadership (or  rear-guarding) of groups of Caribou. (Other examples are mentioned in  the sections on _Migration_.) A band of about 20, after feeding for a  time on the south bank of Windy River on June 16, moved off upstream,  mostly in single file, with a patriarchal buck in the lead. The  remainder of the band included several lesser bucks and various does and  yearlings. On the following day a band of equal size, composed chiefly  of bucks but including three hornless individuals (does?), was led by  two of the bigger bucks. When a band of some 40 does and fawns  approached Little River to cross it on August 25, a doe came first to  the water's edge to make a careful inspection. On the same day I  remarked having noted several times that a buck brought up the rear of a  band. On August 26 I noted that"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33767"],[0,"Campward Ho! A Manual for Girl Scout Camps (#20)"],[1,"well, or put them in the ice box, or some  cool place for the water to get cold.    Water for cooking can be taken from a lake or stream. It is generally  boiled.    If the only source of supply is a brook or stream, water for drinking  should be taken above camp. All vessels in which it is carried or kept  should be thoroughly washed each day.    No camp should remain open if the water supply is not what it ought to  be.    If a camp is supplied with running water and plumbing has been installed  the location and covering of the tank and the cesspool are important  things to consider.    The drain pipes connected with sinks or tubs should be flushed  occasionally with disinfectants, the sink drain cleaned daily with  boiling water and washing soda.    Marsh land near a camp site which is otherwise desirable, if treated  with crude oil or the water drained off by ditches, will not prove a  menace.      Latrines    Every camp must be provided with adequate latrine service. One unit for  every eight or ten people is considered necessary. The type of latrine  to be used will depend on existing conditions at the camp site, but  whatever it is the greatest care must be taken to keep them clean. Seats  and covers should be scrubbed every day, houses swept and toilet paper  provided. Covers should not remain open, and it should be considered a  misdemeanor to throw cloths of any kind into a latrine. As a place must  be provided for them it is suggested that a small portable incinerator  be kept in a closed box stood in one corner of the latrine house, and  that the incinerator be removed every day to a near-by open place and  the contents burned.    [Illustration: VOLLEY BALL]    Latrines should be cleaned out before camp opens and the ground around  them left perfectly clean. As a precaution make sure that no part of the  contents is deposited anywhere near camp. If the ordinary out-of-door  closet is used, see that chloride of lime is sprinkled in the pit daily.    If a small group is to be provided for in a temporary camp and a latrine  must be built, the earthen closet will probably give the best  satisfaction. This is made by digging a trench 2 ft. wide, 3 ft. deep  and in length 2 ft. for each unit. Over the trench place a box seat 17  inches high, with holes having hinged covers. Bank earth around the  bottom of the box and in front of it place a board walk. Protect the  seat by pitching a tent over it or encircling it with a strip of canvas  5 ft. high, fastened to posts, the ends of which pass each other forming  a protected doorway. A box of earth and a small shovel should be kept in  the tent and every time the closet is used earth should be thrown into  it. Lime should be used daily. When necessary to dig a new trench make  sure that the old one is properly filled in. A latrine of this kind must  not be placed near any water supply.    A type of latrine which is being built on permanent camp sites in the  Palisades Interstate Park and which has been developed by the engineers  of the Park Commission, is giving such satisfaction that an outline of  its construction is herewith given.    Dig a pit in which is built a concrete tank 3 ft. wide, 3 ft. deep at  one end, and 3 ft. 8 inches at the other, and 17 ft. in length for eight  units, the concrete 6 inches thick.    Build over it a house 6 or 7 ft. wide, the rear and one side wall of  which rest on the rear and lower end wall of the pit. The deep end of  the pit for 18 inches is left outside of the house. This opening, which  must have an adjustable cover, is used when cleaning the pit.    Floor the building to within 20 inches of the rear wall. Cover the  opening in the floor with a box seat 17 inches high leaving in it  properly made toilet seats, 2 ft. apart from center to center, with  covers.    Make four agitators, one for every two units, by fastening a wooden  paddle 5 x 7 inches onto one end of a 5-ft. length of 2-inch iron pipe.  Put the pipes through a slot in the seat between the two openings, the  paddle at right angles to the length of the seat, and clearing the  bottom of the pit by three inches. The agitators are held in place by  clamps attached to the bottom of he seat which allows the pipe handle to  be moved from side to side. Vent pipes 4 inches in diameter extend from  the pit up through the seat back of each cover, and through the roof for  18 inches.    Charge the pit with 175 gallons of water and 240 pounds of Kaustine, a  patented chemical compound. By moving the agitator handles from side to  side whenever the latrine is used all solid matter is brought in contact  with the Kaustine solution and decomposed.    As with all other latrines, the house must be kept clean and the seats  scrubbed each day. It is not necessary to use any disinfectants in this  type of house, but it should have two doors and windows.      2. FIRST AID    First Aid supplies are a necessity in camp and should always be  provided. Some one person must be responsible for them and when possible  this person should be either a trained nurse or a practical nurse.      Essential Supplies              Absorbent cotton            Sterile gauze            Bandages            Iodine            Vaseline            Bicarbonate of soda            Castor oil            Alcohol and sugar of lead (for ivy poisoning)            Hot water bottle            Alcohol            Aromatic Spirits of Ammonia            Epsom salts            Small alcohol stove and pan            Cascara            White enamel basin            Towels    The nurse should have a tent or a corner in some building where a table  and shelf covered with oil cloth and a bed can be placed and all  supplies properly cared for. No one should be allowed to take any of the  supplies without her permission.      3. FIRE PREVENTION    It is advisable to have in every camp, pails of water standing in the  mess hall, in the kitchen, or in other accessible places, or small  chemical fire apparatus to be used in case of necessity. A fire drill is  also an essential provision.    Place the indoor camp stove on a concrete base with zinc back of it.    In building the mess hall chimney, be sure that two flues are built, in  case one needs to be used for the kitchen stove pipe, as one flue cannot  be used for two fires.      4. THE HEALTH WINNER IN CAMP    Before any child is admitted to a Girl Scout camp she should have been  thoroughly examined by a competent physician. These examinations should  be arranged for by the Local Councils. With very slight effort it is  possible to enlist the interest of physicians, particularly women  physicians, in making these examinations.    The accompanying certificate (p. 52) is particularly recommended as  preferable to an informal statement. This certificate, properly filled  out, should be of great assistance to the Camp Director in safeguarding  the health of the Scouts in camp. It must be remembered that young girls  are ambitious to do all that their fellows do, and very seldom are  willing to admit any physical disability. The responsibility should not  be on their shoulders. Camp life subjects each person to quite unusual  physical exertion which in some cases may amount to a strain. The things  to be especially guarded against are heart disturbances, either  functional or organic; painful or too profuse menstruation; flat foot,  weak backs and prolapsed intestine. Under-nutrition and anemia will  usually be automatically corrected by life in the open and the  consequent increased appetite. No child who is markedly undernourished,  however, should be allowed to take extraordinary exercise until she has  begun to gain.    Before the Scouts start for camp they should be assembled and inspected  in a group by a nurse, or some other person competent to detect body and  head lice. No Scout should be allowed to come to camp infested with  vermin, and yet this happens repeatedly unless definite precautions are  taken. As a rule this cannot be left to the examining physician. If this  examination is made as early as a week ahead of the time to start for  camp the children's heads can be cleansed.    To cleanse the head from lice, rub the scalp and saturate the hair with  kerosene. Tie the head up in a thick, clean cloth held in place with  safety pins. Leave the bandage on over night. After removing the bandage  it should be plunged at once into hot soap suds, and thoroughly washed.  Wash the scalp and hair with castile or ivory soap, rinsing thoroughly.  Dry with clean towels. Combs and brushes should be thoroughly cleansed  before using. It may be necessary to repeat this process once.    The ideal should be held before each Scout of having her health record  while in camp a perfect one. Should any unforeseen trouble arise,  however, she must report at once to the nurse or Director.    Whenever possible, sleep with tent sides and flaps up; never with the  tent closed except in case of a severe storm.    Indigestion, constipation, diarrhea, headaches, bruises, blisters,  strains and sprains, insect bites, sunburn and ivy poisoning are some of  the common camp ailments that have to be dealt with.    Observing the Scout Health requirements as discussed in the Handbook,  \"Scouting for Girls,\" helps very much in establishing a healthy Scout  camp and keeping out of it conditions which are often due to  carelessness.    [Illustration: THE FIRST AID HOUSE]          XII    FEEDING THE MULTITUDE      1. PROVISIONING    To buy in large quantities at wholesale and pay for the order within ten  days is economy. To ship by boat and not by rail, when possible, also  saves money. To have a dry, well ventilated store room and an ice room  is to save still more. It is possible and feasible to order before camp  opens, the necessary dry groceries and canned goods to be used in a camp  of 150 during a period of four to five weeks, and to care for same in a  comparatively small space."]]]
