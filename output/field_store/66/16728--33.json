They soon after reached Koorkarany, a Mahommedan town, which contained a  mosque, and was surrounded by a high wall.  The _maraboo_, or priest, a  black, showed Park a number of Arabic manuscripts, passages from which  he read and explained in Mandingo.    Moving on at noon of the 21st of December, the traveller...    This page and the next page are missing.    This page and the previous page are missing.    His fellow-travellers considered it necessary to journey by night till  they could reach a more hospitable part of the country.  They  accordingly started as soon as the people in the village had gone to  sleep.  The stillness of the air, the howling of the wild beasts and the  deep solitude of the forest made the scene solemn and impressive.  Not a  word, except in a whisper, was uttered; and his companions pointed out  to him the wolves and hyaenas, as they glided like shadows from one  thicket to another.    The inhabitants of Bondou are called Foulahs.  They are naturally of a  mild and gentle disposition; but the uncharitable maxims of the Koran  have made them less hospitable to strangers and more reserved in their  behaviour than the Mandingoes.    Leaving Bondou, the caravan entered the kingdom of Kajaaga.  The  inhabitants, whose complexion is jet-black, are called Serrawoollies.  The _dooty_, or chief man of Joag, the frontier town, though a rigid  Mahommedan, treated Park very civilly; but while he was staying there a  party of horseman, sent by the king, arrived to conduct him to Maana,  his residence.  When there, the king demanded enormous duties, and Park  had to pay him the five drachms of gold which he had received from the  King of Bondou, besides which his baggage was opened and everything of  value taken.  His companions now begged him to turn back, and Johnson  declared it would be impossible to proceed without money.  He had  fortunately concealed some of his property; but they were afraid of  purchasing provisions, lest the king should rob him of his few remaining  effects.  They therefore resolved to combat hunger during the day and  wait for another opportunity of obtaining food.    While seated on the ground, with his servant-boy by his side, a poor  woman came up with a basket on her head, and asked Park if he had had  his dinner.  The boy replied that the king's people had robbed him of  all his money.  On hearing this the good old woman, with a look of  unaffected benevolence, took the basket from her head, and presented him  with a few handfuls of ground nuts, walking away before he had time to  thank her.    Leaving Joag in company with thirty persons and six loaded asses, he  rode on cheerfully for some hours till the caravan reached a species of  tree for which Johnson had frequently inquired.  On seeing it he  produced a white chicken which he had purchased at Joag, tied it by a  leg to one of the branches, and then told his companions that they might  safely proceed, as the journey would be prosperous.    This incident shows the power of superstition over the minds of negroes;  for though this man had resided seven years in England, it was evident  that he still retained the superstitions imbibed in his youth.    Koomakary was the birthplace of one of Park's companions from Pisania, a  blacksmith, who had been attentive to him on the road.  On approaching  the place shouts were raised and muskets were fired.  The meeting  between the long-absent blacksmith and his relations was very tender.  The younger ones having embraced him, his aged mother was led forth,  leaning upon a staff.  Every one made way for her as she stretched out  her hands to bid her son welcome.  Being totally blind, she stroked his  arms, hands and face with great care, and seemed highly delighted that  her ears once more could hear the music of his voice.  \"It was evident,\"  observes Park, \"that, whatever may be the difference between the negro  and European, there is none in the genuine sympathies and characteristic  feelings of our common nature.\"    The king, Dembo Sego, gave the traveller an audience, and appeared  well-disposed towards him.  An escort was also sent to conduct him to  the frontiers of Kaarta.    The capital of that province was reached on the 12th of February, and as  soon as he arrived a messenger came from the king, bidding him welcome,  and a large hut was at once provided for his accommodation.  The people,  however crowded in till it was completely full; when the first visitors  went, another took their place--in this way the hut being filled and  emptied thirteen different times.    Park found the king, whose name was Daisy, surrounded by a number of  attendants, the fighting men on his right-hand and the women and  children on his left.  A bank of earth, on which was spread a  leopard-skin, formed the throne.  Daisy seemed perfectly satisfied with  the account the traveller gave of himself, but warned him of the dangers  in his way on account of the war which was then raging, and advised him  to return to Kason, there to remain till it was over.  Wise as this  advice was, the approaching hot months made it important for him to  proceed, dreading as he did having to spend the rainy season in the  interior of Africa.    Daisy presented him with food, and sent a party of horse men to conduct  him to Jarra, while three of his sons, with about two hundred horsemen,  undertook to accompany him part of the way.    He had evidence of the disturbed state of the country while staying at  the next town he entered.  A body of Moors approached the gates and  carried off the cattle, and one of the horsemen was shot by a Moor.  The  wounded man was brought in, when, as he was borne along, his mother went  before, clapping her hands and enumerating the good qualities of her  son.  The ball had passed through both his legs, and as he and his  friends would not consent to have one of them amputated, he died the  same night.    Going forward, on the 18th they passed through Simbug, the frontier  village of Ludamar.  It was from hence Major Haughton wrote his last  letter, with a pencil, to Dr Laidley.  After leaving the place, when  endeavouring to make his way across the desert, he was murdered by some  savage Mahommedans, who robbed him of everything he possessed.    At this time, while Daisy was employed in fortifying a strong position  among the hills, his territory was overrun by his enemy, Mansong.    On the evening of the 5th of March Park reached the town of Dalli.  Here  the people crowded in so disagreeable a manner to see the white  stranger, that his host proposed, in order to avoid them, going in the  cool of the evening to a negro village called Samee, at a short distance  off.    As he was now within two days' journey of the heathen kingdom of Goumba,  he had no apprehensions from the Moors, and readily accepted the  invitation.  His landlord was proud of the honour of entertaining a  white man, and Park spent the forenoon very pleasantly with these poor  negroes, their gentleness of manner presenting a striking contrast to  the rudeness and barbarity of the Moors.    While thus enjoying himself, greatly to his dismay a party of Moorish  soldiers suddenly appeared in the place.  They were sent, they said, by  their chief, Ali, to convey the white stranger to his camp at Benowm.  If he would come willingly it would be better for him, but come he must,  as they had orders to convey him by force; because Fatima, Ali's wife,  having heard much about Christians, was anxious to see one.  Park,  unable to resist, was compelled to accompany them.  The journey occupied  many days, during which both Park and his attendants suffered much from  thirst.    On the evening of the 12th they came in sight of Benowm, which presented  to the eye a number of dirty-looking tents scattered without order over  a large space of ground.  Among the tents appeared large herds of  camels, cattle and goats.  As soon as he was seen the people who were  drawing water threw down their buckets and, rushing towards him, began  to treat him with the greatest discourtesy; one pulled at his clothes,  another took off his hat, while a third stopped him to examine his  waistcoat buttons.    At length the king's tent was reached, where a number of men and women  were assembled.  Ali was seated on a black leather cushion, clipping a  few hairs from his upper lip, a female attendant holding up a  looking-glass before him.    He enquired whether the stranger could speak Arabic, and being answered  in the negative he remained silent.  The ladies, however, asked a  thousand questions, inspected his apparel, searched his pockets, and  obliged him to unbutton his waistcoat to display the whiteness of his  skin.    In the evening the priests announced prayer.  Before they departed his  Moorish guide told him that Ali was about to present him with something  to eat.  On looking round he saw some boys bringing a wild hog, which  they tied to one of the tent ropes, when Ali made signs to him to kill  and dress it for supper.  Though very hungry, he did not think it  prudent to eat any part of an animal so much detested by the Moors, and  therefore replied that he never touched such food.  The hog was then  untied, in the hopes that it would run at the stranger, the Moors  believing that a great enmity subsists between hogs and Christians.  In  this, however, they were disappointed, for the animal no sooner regained  his liberty than he began to attack indiscriminately every person who  came in his way, and at last took shelter under the couch upon which the  king was sitting.    Park was after this conducted to a hut, where he found another wild  hog--tied there to a stick for the purpose of annoying him.  It"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21400"],[0,"Style in Singing (#3)"],[1,"correct taste must first be formed by the study of the noblest  creations in the particular art that claims attention. In singing, as  in the sister arts, the laws which govern Style must be apprehended  and understood before Individuality can be given full scope.  Otherwise, what to the executant would appear as original might, to  correct taste and judgment, appear ridiculous and extravagant. A  genius is sometimes eccentric, but eccentricity is not genius. Vocal  students should hear as many good singers as possible, but actually  imitate none. A skilled teacher will always discern and strive to  develop the personality of the pupil, will be on the alert to discover  latent features of originality and character. He will respect and  encourage individuality, rather than insist upon the servile imitation  of some model--even though that model be himself. As the distinguished  artist Victor Maurel has justly observed: \"Of all the bad forms of  teaching singing, that by imitation is the worst\" (_Un Probleme  d'Art_).    In singing, as in painting, a copy has never the value of the  original. Moreover, slavish imitation in any art has a deleterious  influence. But to respect irreproachable examples and fitly observe  sound rules, whose very survival often justifies their existence and  testifies to their value, is always of benefit to the artist. To  imitate is to renounce one's individual expression of an ideal and  present that of another. But to observe established and accepted laws,  laws founded on Truth and consecrated by Time, is not to imitate, when  those laws are applied in an original and individual manner that is in  harmony with the personality of the interpreter. \"_L'art est un coin  de Nature vu a travers un temperament._\" In literature, each writer  has his own special style which may easily be recognized; but all  follow the same grammatical rules. A correct style in singing consists  in the careful observance of the principles of Technique; a perfect  Diction; the appropriate Colouring of each sentiment expressed;  attention to the musical and poetic Accents; judicious and effective  Phrasing (whether musical or verbal), so that the meaning of both  composer and poet may be placed in the clearest light.           *       *       *       *       *    Let us analyze Style in its three principal aspects: Colour, Accent,  and Phrasing.      COLOUR    Of all the elements of Style in singing, the most potent and  effective--the one, indeed, that is essential for the success of the  lyric artist--is the ability to vary the vocal timbre; that is, to  sing with Colour. This desideratum of varied tone-colour is sought  even by instrumentalists. Nay, the instrument itself is sometimes  constructed with this object in view. Witness the invention of the  \"soft\" pedal, which is intended not solely to reduce the intensity of  tone in the pianoforte--that may be accomplished by a modification of  force in striking the note--but to give the tones a darker, more  sombre quality, or colour. To vary the tone-colour, a violinist or  'cellist draws the bow across the strings close to, or distant from,  the bridge, in accordance with his desire for a reed-like or  flute-like quality of tone. Anyone who has listened to the performance  of the slow movement in Paganini's Concerto in _D_, by an Ysaye or a  Mischa Elman, will have remarked how the skilful use of varied tone  colour and other devices imparts a wonderful charm to music  intrinsically of but mediocre value.    A singer may have a good quality of voice; but that is normal. If he  can vary it only in degrees of loudness (Intensity) and not in  differences of timbre (Colour) he cannot be ranked as an artist. No  matter how great the natural beauty and sonority of his voice, his  performance will always be monotonous, if he has only one tint on his  vocal palette. In speech--from which the effect is borrowed--utterances  of grave and serious meaning, and those of gayer import, are not made  with the same colour of voice. A brighter quality (_voix claire_) is  used instinctively for an ejaculation uttered by one to whom pleasant  or joyful news has been communicated. On the contrary, should it be  the cause of sorrow or grief for the listener, he will use--should he  have occasion to reply--a darker quality of voice (_voix sombre_).  Such phenomena are physiological. The vocal organs are the most  sensitive of any in the human economy: they betray at once the mental  condition of the individual. Joy is a great tonic, and acts on the  vocal cords and mucous membrane as does an astringent; a brilliant and  clear quality of voice is the result. Grief or Fear, on the other  hand, being depressing emotions, lower the vitality, and the  debilitating influence communicates to the voice a dull and sombre  character.    On this question of colour in the voice, the masterly writer and  critic Legouve says: \"Certain particular gifts are necessary if the  speech is to possess colour. The first of these is Metal in the voice.  He who has it not will never shine as a colourist. The metal may be  gold, silver or brass; each has its individual characteristic. A  golden voice is the most brilliant; a silvery voice has the most  charm; a brassy voice the most power. But one of the three  characteristics is essential. A voice without metallic ring is like  teeth without enamel; they may be sound and healthy, but they are not  brilliant.... In speech there are several colours--a bright, ringing  quality; one soft and veiled. The bright, strident hues of purple and  gold in a picture may produce a masterpiece of gorgeous colouring; so,  in a different manner, may the harmonious juxtaposition of greys,  lilacs and browns on a canvas by Veronese, Rubens, or Delacroix.    \"Last of all is the velvety voice. This is worthless if not allied  with one of the three others. In order that a velvety voice may  possess value it must be reinforced (_doublee_) with 'metal.' A  velvety voice is merely one of cotton.\"[1]    [Footnote 1: These admirably expressed views illustrate and exemplify  the principles I laid down in a _conference_ (Paris, 1902) on  Voice-Production (_Pose de la Voix_), wherein I demonstrated the  possibility of acquiring, by the aid of the resonating cavities, a  greater sonority, more in conformity with the demands and necessities  of present-day music.]    It may be of interest to notice that the quality which in France is  designated \"timbre,\" is called by the Italians \"_metallo di voce_,\"  or, \"metal of the voice.\" Those who heard Madame Sarah Bernhardt  fifteen or twenty years ago will readily understand why her countless  friends and admirers always spoke of her matchless organ as \"_la voix  d'or_.\"    The late Sims Reeves, the famous tenor, was a perfect master of all  varieties and shades of vocal colour, and displayed his mastery with  certainty and unfailing effect in the different fields of Oratorio and  Opera. In the recitative \"Deeper and deeper still,\" with its  subsequent aria \"Waft her, angels, through the skies\" [Handel], he  ranged through the entire gamut of tone-colour. As Edgardo in  Donizetti's _Lucia di Lammermoor_, he launched the \"Maladetta\" phrase  of the curse with a voice that was almost \"white\" with frenzied rage;  while the pathetic sombre quality he employed in the \"_Fra poco a me  ricovero_\" fitly accorded with the despairing mood and gloomy  surroundings of the hapless Edgardo.    Some singers control but two colours or timbres--the very clear (open)  and the very sombre (closed), which they exaggerate. In reality,  however, the gradations between them can be made infinite by the  artist who is in possession of the secret--especially if he has the  ability to combine Colour with Intensity.    An illustration of this is found in the example cited in the opening  paragraph of the present work:--\"For now is Christ risen.\" Not only  did Mme. Tietjens make a gradual _crescendo_ from the first note to  the climax, but the tonal colours were also subtly graduated from a  comparatively sombre quality to one of the utmost clearness and  brilliance.    [Music: As sung by Mme. Tietjens    For now is Christ risen, for now is Christ risen from the dead.]    As contrasting examples in which the two principal colours may be  employed effectively, I may cite the Bacchic air, \"_O vin, dissipe la  tristesse_,\" and the pensive monologue, \"_Etre, ou ne pas etre_,\" both  from the opera _Hamlet_, by Ambroise Thomas. The forced, unnatural  quality of the first calls for the use of a clear, open, brilliant  timbre.    [Music:    O vin, dissipe la tristesse  Qui pese sur mon coeur!  A moi les reves de l'ivresse,  Et le rire moqueur!]    But for the second, \"To be, or not to be\":    [Music:    Etre, ou ne pas etre! o mystere!  Mourir! dormir, dormir!]    a sombre, closed timbre is necessary. The opening recitative of  Vanderdecken in _Der fliegende Hollaender_ by Wagner would be absurd,  and utterly out of harmony with the character and his surroundings, if  sung in the open timbre. Perhaps I ought to explain that \"open\" (_voix  claire_, Fr.), and \"closed\" (_voix sombre_, Fr.), are technical terms,  of which the equivalents are accepted in all countries where the art  of singing is cultivated; terms that apply to _quality_ of tone, not  to the _physical_ process by which these effects are produced. Such a  mistake is not infrequently made by vocal physiologists who are not  practical musicians or singing-teachers. Nor must the term \"clear  timbre\" be understood to mean the \"white voice\" (\"_voix blanche_,\" or  \"_voce bianca_\"); this, like the guttural timbre, being only  occasionally employed for the expression of some violent passion, such  as hate.    Like the admirable paintings of Eugene Carriere, for instance his  masterly portrait of Paul Verlaine, a song, sometimes an entire role,  may be worked out in monochrome; though the gradations of tint are  numerous,"]]]
