In 1539 his  successor, Robert Fuller, the last of the Augustinian Priors,  surrendered the entire property to Henry VIII, in compliance with the  Act of Dissolution, its value having been already ascertained in the  twenty-sixth year of the King's reign. The exact figures are given by  Dugdale as follows:        Summa totalis hujus monasterii.

H. Shepherd del. Howlett sc._]    For many years before the dissolution of the monasteries the system on  which they rested had been gradually undermined by the spread of the  Reformation, accompanied by a growing conviction that the religious  communities had not only outlived their usefulness, and to a great  extent departed from the high standard of their founders, but that their  enormous wealth had given them an influence far beyond that of any other  institution, or combination of institutions, in the kingdom, and brought  them into formidable rivalry with the State itself--the more dangerous  in proportion to their devoted adherence to the Papacy, with which the  State was in collision. By whatever unworthy motives Henry VIII may have  been governed in aiming at the monastic property, he was therefore able  to bring forward many political considerations, which coincided with  those arising out of religious doctrines, to make his measures  intelligible to his people, and consequently easy to himself. Among the  various plausible reasons which were urged against the continued  existence of the conventual houses, one of the most likely to appeal to  the practical sense of the multitude was the misuse of the resources  with which they had been endowed. While it was admitted that in their  earlier days they had been extremely useful in mitigating distress among  the poor, it was now argued that their indiscriminate charities were  doing more harm than good, and that the changed economic conditions of  the sixteenth century called for a corresponding change in the  distribution of relief, to save the country from being overrun by  undeserving mendicants, amongst whom some of the religious Orders were  themselves to be reckoned. It does not appear that any part of this  argument held good against the Augustinian Canons, or that the more  serious moral charges brought against the smaller communities were at  all applicable to their case, which was rather one of involvement in a  common ruin than the result of any specific accusation. It is true there  are instances of laxity at individual houses, showing a too easy  discipline where they occurred, but there is nothing sufficiently  extensive or important to compromise the Order as a whole, or materially  damage its character in the eyes of the impartial modern student.[10]    It might have been expected that some immunity from the wholesale  spoliation which followed the Act would have been granted to Rahere's  foundation, in view of his special provision for the poor in the  hospital which was an integral part of it. The hospital has indeed been  allowed to survive as a separate institution; but the whole of the  strictly monastic buildings were doomed, the nave of the church being at  once pulled down, and the choir only preserved for the use of the  parish. With this reservation, the site of the Priory and the buildings  upon it, including the Lady Chapel, were sold in 1546 to Sir Richard  Rich, Knight (Attorney General), for the consideration of L1,064 11_s._  3_d._, and the property has remained in the hands of his descendants  till quite recent years. The possession was, however, interrupted by  Queen Mary, who introduced the Dominican Order of Black Friars into the  Convent. They had started rebuilding the nave when the accession of  Elizabeth meant a return to the policy of her father, the expulsion of  the friars, and the restitution of the Priory estate to Richard (then  Lord) Rich and his heirs \"in free socage,\" by a renewal of the previous  grant.[11]    Some idea of the strong ecclesiastical influence broken up at the  Dissolution may be gathered from a glance at any old map of London,  showing the numerous religious foundations by which the Priory was then  surrounded, now for the most part swept away, or only surviving here and  there in institutions which retain the ancient names under modern  conditions. Immediately to the north lay the Carthusian monastery,  familiarly known as the Charterhouse. On the north-west was the Priory  of St. John-of-Jerusalem, founded by the Knights Hospitallers. The  Franciscan Convent of the Grey Friars extended along the southern  boundary of St. Bartholomew's, between the Priory walls and St. Paul's  Cathedral. To the south-west, near the Thames, there was the monastery  of the Carmelites, or White Friars, with the church and houses of the  Knights Templars beyond it. Within the City, to the east, were the great  establishments of the Austin Friars and St. Helen's nunnery, while east  and west the churches spread--many of monastic origin--culminating in  two of the most important buildings in Europe, the Tower of London and  the palace of Westminster, each with its ecclesiastical dependencies,  the whole dominated by the mediaeval spirit about to be dispelled, for  good or evil, by the great movements of the Renaissance and Reformation.    A conjectural restoration of the Priory buildings, as they stood in  Prior Bolton's time, based on the records available in 1893, and the  architectural fragments which then remained, shows them to have been  bounded on the northern side by the Church, which extended from the Lady  Chapel at its eastern extremity to somewhere near the line indicated by  the small archway now leading from the public square into the churchyard  on the west. This churchyard covers the ground formerly occupied by the  nave, a mutilated portion of which remains within the building, attached  to the lower stage of the central tower. It seems clear that the choir  once extended over the tower-space, and was separated from the nave by a  screen, with a parish-altar on its western side for public worship,  while the chancel was reserved for the monastic services, with a raised  presbytery for the high altar at its eastern end--a threefold division  providing for the ancient ritual arrangement.    In the ambulatory on the northern side of the choir there were  apparently three chapels, besides Bishop Walden's chantry, which was the  easternmost of the series, and is supposed to have had a semicircular  apse. There was a similar, but rather smaller, chapel opposite to it on  the south side, and between it and the south transept a sacristy,  erected about 1350.    Outside the Lady Chapel lay the cemetery of the Canons, on the favourite  (south) side for burials. The cloister formed a large quadrangle  attached to the south aisle. The Prior's residence was probably on the  western side of the quadrangle, and on the south there was a range of  buildings comprising the refectory, buttery, and kitchen, with the Close  beyond them.    Opening into the cloister on the east was the Chapter House, an oblong  structure, adjoining which, on the south, was the dormitory, overlooking  the Mulberry Gardens on the east, and the Close on its western side.[12]    [Illustration: PLAN, PARTLY CONJECTURAL, OF THE MONASTIC BUILDINGS AT                 THE DISSOLUTION        A Lady Chapel.

R Refectory.]    The work of demolition commenced immediately after the transfer of the  property to Henry VIII, when the nave was destroyed; and as soon as Sir  Richard Rich came into possession, he started pulling down the buildings  for the sake of the materials, which were used in the erection of new  houses where the old had formerly stood, as well as on the gardens and  orchards around them. By the time of Queen Elizabeth the district had  become a favourite residential quarter for great people, who gradually  disappeared with the growth of London, and the migration of gentry  westwards, when the houses vacated in Smithfield were let off in  tenements to the same sort of poor people who now share the  neighbourhood with merchants and shopkeepers.    During Elizabeth's reign the church had been allowed to get into a very  dilapidated state, and that it was in some danger of total destruction  appears from a letter written by Edmund Grindal in 1563, while he was  Bishop of London, to Sir William Cecil, proposing to take the lead from  the roof, and transfer it to St. Paul's Cathedral:        St. Bartholomew's Churche, adjoining to my L.

Vol. I. NEW YORK, JULY 1, 1850. No. 1.          INTRODUCTION.      Of the revolutions of the age, one of the most interesting and important  is that which has taken place in the forms of Literature and the Modes  of its Publication. Since the establishment of the _Edinburgh Review_  the finest intelligences of the world have been displayed in  periodicals. Brougham, Jeffrey, Sidney Smith, Mackintosh, Macaulay, have  owed nearly all their best fame to compositions which have appeared  first in journals, magazines and reviews; the writers of Tales and  Essays have uniformly come before the public by the same means, which  have recently served also for the original exhibition of the most  elaborate and brilliant Fictions, so that we are now receiving through  them by almost every ship from Europe installments of works by Dickens,  Bulwer, James, Croly, Lever, Reynolds, Mrs. Marsh, Mrs. Ellis, and  indeed nearly all the most eminent contemporary novelists. So complete  is the change, that all mind, except the heaviest and least popular, is  likely to flow hereafter through the Daily, Weekly, Monthly or Quarterly  Miscellanies, which compete with universities, parliaments, churches,  and libraries, for ascendency in the government of mankind.    In this country we must keep pace with the movements abroad. It will not  answer that we issue literary productions as soon as possible after  their completion. The impatient readers demand chapters by chapters, as  they are spun from the brain and the heart of the author; facts, upon  the instant of their discovery; and suggestions, as they flash from the  contact of imagination and reflection.    The INTERNATIONAL WEEKLY MISCELLANY will be a result of efforts to  satisfy a plain necessity of the times. It will combine the excellencies  of all contemporary periodicals, with features that will be peculiar to  itself.    I. A leading object will be to present the public, with the utmost  rapidity and at the cheapest possible rate, the best of those works in  Popular Literature which are appearing abroad in serials, or in separate  chapters. With this view, we print in the first number the initial  portions of the brilliant nautical romance now in course of publication  in _Blackwood's Magazine_, under the title of \"The Green Hand,\" by the  author of the most celebrated fiction of its class in English  literature, \"Tom Cringle's Log;\" and other works will be selected and  carried on simultaneously, as they shall come to us with the stamp of  sufficient merit.
