[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20034"],[0,"Scottish Ghost Stories (#3)"],[1," and I were ascending the staircase on our way to bed, when  Alice, who had run upstairs ahead of us, met us with a scared face.    \"Oh, do come to my room!\" she cried. \"Something has happened to Mary.\"  (Mary was one of the housemaids.)    We both accompanied her, and, on entering her room, found Mary seated  on a chair, sobbing hysterically. One only had to glance at the girl  to see that she was suffering from some very severe shock. Though  normally red-cheeked and placid, in short, a very healthy, stolid  creature, and the last person to be easily perturbed, she was now  without a vestige of colour, whilst the pupils of her eyes were  dilated with terror, and her entire body, from the crown of her head  to the soles of her feet, shook as if with ague. I was immeasurably  shocked to see her.    \"Why, Mary,\" Margaret exclaimed, \"whatever is the matter? What has  happened?\"    \"It's the candle, miss,\" the girl gasped, \"the candle in Miss Trevor's  room. I can't put it out.\"    \"You can't put it out, why, what nonsense!\" Margaret said. \"Are you  mad?\"    \"It is as true as I sit here, miss,\" Mary panted. \"I put the candle on  the mantelpiece while I set the room to rights, and when I had  finished and came to blow it out, I couldn't. I blew, and blew, and  blew, but it hadn't any effect, and then I grew afraid, miss, horribly  afraid,\" and here she buried her face in her hands, and shuddered.  \"I've never been frightened like this before, miss,\" she returned  slowly, \"and I've come away and left the candle burning.\"    \"How absurd of you,\" Margaret scolded. \"We must go and put it out at  once. I have a good mind to make you come with us, Mary--but there!  Stay where you are, and for goodness' sake stop crying, or every one  in the house will hear you.\"    So saying, Margaret hurried off,--Alice and I accompanying her,--and  on arriving outside my room, the door of which was wide open, we  perceived the lighted candle standing in the position Mary had  described. I looked at the girls, and perceived, in spite of my  endeavours not to perceive it, the unmistakable signs of a great  fear--fear of something they suspected but dared not name--lurking in  the corners of their eyes.    \"Who will go first?\" Margaret demanded. No one spoke.    \"Well then,\" she continued, \"I will,\" and, suiting the action to the  word, she stepped over the threshold. The moment she did so, the door  began to close. \"This is curious!\" she cried. \"Push!\"    We did; we all three pushed; but, despite our efforts, the door came  resolutely to, and we were shut out. Then before we had time to  recover from our astonishment, it flew open; but before we could cross  the threshold, it came violently to in the same manner as before. Some  unseen force held it against us.    \"Let us make one more effort,\" Margaret said, \"and if we don't  succeed, we will call for help.\"    Obeying her instructions, we once again pushed. I was nearest the  handle, and in some manner,--how, none of us could ever explain,--just  as the door opened of its own accord, I slipped and fell inside. The  door then closed immediately with a bang, and, to my unmitigated  horror, I found myself alone in the room. For some seconds I was  spellbound, and could not even collect my thoughts sufficiently to  frame a reply to the piteous entreaties of the Holkitts, who kept  banging on the door, and imploring me to tell them what was happening.  Never in the hideous excitement of nightmare had I experienced such a  terror as the terror that room conveyed to my mind. Though nothing was  to be seen, nothing but the candle, the light of which was peculiarly  white and vibrating, I felt the presence of something inexpressibly  menacing and horrible. It was in the light, the atmosphere, the  furniture, everywhere. On all sides it surrounded me, on all sides I  was threatened--threatened in a manner that was strange and deadly.  Something suggesting to me that the source of evil originated in the  candle, and that if I could succeed in extinguishing the light I  should free myself from the ghostly presence, I advanced towards the  mantelpiece, and, drawing in a deep breath, blew--blew with the  energy born of desperation. It had no effect. I repeated my efforts; I  blew frantically, madly, but all to no purpose; the candle still  burned--burned softly and mockingly. Then a fearful terror seized me,  and, flying to the opposite side of the room, I buried my face against  the wall, and waited for what the sickly beatings of my heart warned  me was coming. Constrained to look, I slightly, only very, very  slightly, moved round, and there, there, floating stealthily towards  me through the air, came the candle, the vibrating, glowing, baleful  candle. I hid my face again, and prayed God to let me faint. Nearer  and nearer drew the light; wilder and wilder the wrenches at the door.  Closer and closer I pressed myself to the wall. And then, then when  the final throes of agony were more than human heart and brain could  stand, there came the suspicion, the suggestion of a touch--of a touch  so horrid that my prayers were at last answered, and I fainted. When I  recovered, I was in Margaret's room, and half a dozen well-known forms  were gathered round me. It appears that with the collapse of my body  on the floor, the door, that had so effectually resisted every effort  to turn the handle, immediately flew open, and I was discovered lying  on the ground with the candle--still alight--on the ground beside me.  My aunt experienced no difficulty in blowing out the refractory  candle, and I was carried with the greatest tenderness into the other  wing of the house, where I slept that night. Little was said about the  incident next day, but all who knew of it expressed in their faces the  utmost anxiety--an anxiety which, now that I had recovered, greatly  puzzled me. On our return home, another shock awaited me; we found to  our dismay that my mother was seriously ill, and that the doctor, who  had been sent for from Perth the previous evening, just about the time  of my adventure with the candle, had stated that she might not survive  the day. His warning was fulfilled--she died at sunset. Her death, of  course, may have had nothing at all to do with the candle episode, yet  it struck me then as an odd coincidence, and seems all the more  strange to me after hearing your account of the bogle that touched  your dear father in the road, so near the spot where the Holkitts'  house once stood. I could never discover whether Lady Holkitt or her  daughters ever saw anything of a superphysical nature in their house;  after my experience they were always very reticent on that subject,  and naturally I did not like to press it. On Lady Holkitt's death,  Margaret and Alice sold the house, which was eventually pulled down,  as no one would live in it, and I believe the ground on which it stood  is now a turnip field. That, my dear, is all I can tell you.           *       *       *       *       *    \"Now, Mr. O'Donnell,\" Miss Macdonald added, \"having heard our  experiences, my mother's and mine, what is your opinion? Do you think  the phenomenon of the candle was in any way connected with the bogle  both you and I have seen, or are the hauntings of 'The Old White  House' entirely separate from those of the road?\"                                   CASE II        THE TOP ATTIC IN PRINGLE'S MANSION, EDINBURGH      A charming lady, Miss South, informs me that no house interested her  more, as a child, than Pringle's Mansion, Edinburgh. Pringle's  Mansion, by the bye, is not the real name of the house, nor is the  original building still standing--the fact is, my friend has been  obliged to disguise the locality for fear of an action for slander of  title, such as happened in the Egham Case of 1904-7.    Miss South never saw--save in a picture--the house that so fascinated  her; but through repeatedly hearing about it from her old nurse, she  felt that she knew it by heart, and used to amuse herself hour after  hour in the nursery, drawing diagrams of the rooms and passages,  which, to make quite realistic, she named and numbered.    There was the Admiral's room, Madame's room, Miss Ophelia's room,  Master Gregory's room, Letty's (the nurse's) room, the cook's room,  the butler's room, the housemaid's room--and--the Haunted Room.    The house was very old--probably the sixteenth century--and was  concealed from the thoroughfare by a high wall that enclosed it on all  sides. It had no garden, only a large yard, covered with faded yellow  paving-stones, and containing a well with an old-fashioned roller and  bucket.    When the well was cleaned out, an event which took place periodically  on a certain date, every utensil in the house was called into  requisition for ladling out the water, and the Admiral, himself  supervising, made every servant in the establishment take an active  part in the proceedings. On one of these occasions, the Admiral  announced his intention of going down the well in the bucket. That was  a rare moment in Letty's life, for when the Admiral had been let down  in the bucket, the rope broke!    Indeed, the thought of what the Laird would say when he came up,  almost resulted in his not coming up at all. However, some one,  rather bolder than the rest, retained sufficient presence of mind to  effect a rescue, and the timid ones, thankful enough to survive the  explosion, had to be content on \"half-rations till further orders.\"    But in spite of its association with such a martinet, and in spite of  her ghostly experiences in it, Letty loved the house, and was never  tired of singing its praises.    It was a two-storeyed mansion, with roomy cellars but no basement.  There were four reception-rooms--all oak-panelled--on the ground  floor; numerous kitchen offices, including a cosy housekeeper's room;  and a capacious entrance hall, in the centre of which stood a broad  oak staircase. The"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2005"],[0,"Piccadilly Jim (#3)"],[1," of a woman in the  early forties, rather formidably handsome, beneath which were  printed the words:                Mrs. Nesta Ford Pett                Well-Known Society Leader and Authoress    Ann had risen and was peering over his shoulder. She frowned as  she caught sight of the heading of the page. Then her eye fell  upon the photograph.    \"Good gracious! Why have they got aunt Nesta's picture there?\"    Mr. Pett breathed a deep and gloomy breath.    \"They've found out she's his aunt. I was afraid they would. I  don't know what she will say when she sees this.\"    \"Don't let her see it.\"    \"She has the paper downstairs. She's probably reading it now.\"    Ann was glancing through the article.    \"It seems to be much the same sort of thing that they have  published before. I can't understand why the _Chronicle_ takes such  an interest in Jimmy Crocker.\"    \"Well, you see he used to be a newspaper man, and the _Chronicle_  was the paper he worked for.\"    Ann flushed.    \"I know,\" she said shortly.    Something in her tone arrested Mr. Pett's attention.    \"Yes, yes, of course,\" he said hastily. \"I was forgetting.\"    There was an awkward silence. Mr. Pett coughed. The matter of  young Mr. Crocker's erstwhile connection with the New York  _Chronicle_ was one which they had tacitly decided to refrain from  mentioning.    \"I didn't know he was your nephew, uncle Peter.\"    \"Nephew by marriage,\" corrected Mr. Pett a little hurriedly.  \"Nesta's sister Eugenia married his father.\"    \"I suppose that makes me a sort of cousin.\"    \"A distant cousin.\"    \"It can't be too distant for me.\"    There was a sound of hurried footsteps outside the door. Mrs.  Pett entered, holding a paper in her hand. She waved it before  Mr. Pett's sympathetic face.    \"I know, my dear,\" he said backing. \"Ann and I were just talking  about it.\"    The little photograph had not done Mrs. Pett justice. Seen  life-size, she was both handsomer and more formidable than she  appeared in reproduction. She was a large woman, with a fine  figure and bold and compelling eyes, and her personality crashed  disturbingly into the quiet atmosphere of the room. She was the  type of woman whom small, diffident men seem to marry  instinctively, as unable to help themselves as cockleshell boats  sucked into a maelstrom.    \"What are you going to do about it?\" she demanded, sinking  heavily into the chair which her husband had vacated.    This was an aspect of the matter which had not occurred to Mr.  Pett. He had not contemplated the possibility of actually doing  anything. Nature had made him out of office hours essentially a  passive organism, and it was his tendency, when he found himself  in a sea of troubles, to float plaintively, not to take arms  against it. To pick up the slings and arrows of outrageous  fortune and fling them back was not a habit of his. He scratched  his chin and said nothing. He went on saying nothing.    \"If Eugenia had had any sense, she would have foreseen what would  happen if she took the boy away from New York where he was  working too hard to get into mischief and let him run loose in  London with too much money and nothing to do. But, if she had had  any sense, she would never have married that impossible Crocker  man. As I told her.\"    Mrs. Pett paused, and her eyes glowed with reminiscent fire. She  was recalling the scene which had taken place three years ago  between her sister and herself, when Eugenia had told her of her  intention to marry an obscure and middle-aged actor named Bingley  Crocker. Mrs. Pett had never seen Bingley Crocker, but she had  condemned the proposed match in terms which had ended definitely  and forever her relations with her sister. Eugenia was not a  woman who welcomed criticism of her actions. She was cast in the  same formidable mould as Mrs. Pett and resembled her strikingly  both in appearance and character.    Mrs. Pett returned to the present. The past could look after  itself. The present demanded surgery.    \"One would have thought it would have been obvious even to  Eugenia that a boy of twenty-one needed regular work.\"    Mr. Pett was glad to come out of his shell here. He was the  Apostle of Work, and this sentiment pleased him.    \"That's right,\" he said. \"Every boy ought to have work.\"    \"Look at this young Crocker's record since he went to live in  London. He is always doing something to make himself notorious.  There was that breach-of-promise case, and that fight at the  political meeting, and his escapades at Monte Carlo, and--and  everything. And he must be drinking himself to death. I think  Eugenia's insane. She seems to have no influence over him at  all.\"    Mr. Pett moaned sympathetically.    \"And now the papers have found out that I am his aunt, and I  suppose they will print my photograph whenever they publish an  article about him.\"    She ceased and sat rigid with just wrath. Mr. Pett, who always  felt his responsibilities as chorus keenly during these wifely  monologues, surmised that a remark from him was indicated.    \"It's tough,\" he said.    Mrs. Pett turned on him like a wounded tigress.    \"What is the use of saying that? It's no use saying anything.\"    \"No, no,\" said Mr. Pett, prudently refraining from pointing out  that she had already said a good deal.    \"You must do something.\"    Ann entered the conversation for the first time. She was not very  fond of her aunt, and liked her least when she was bullying Mr.  Pett. There was something in Mrs. Pett's character with which the  imperiousness which lay beneath Ann's cheerful attitude towards  the world was ever at war.    \"What can uncle Peter possibly do?\" she inquired.    \"Why, get the boy back to America and make him work. It's the  only possible thing.\"    \"But is it possible?\"    \"Of course it is.\"    \"Assuming that Jimmy Crocker would accept an invitation to come  over to America, what sort of work could he do here? He couldn't  get his place on the _Chronicle_ back again after dropping out for  all these years and making a public pest of himself all that  while. And outside of newspaper work what is he fit for?\"    \"My dear child, don't make difficulties.\"    \"I'm not. These are ready-made.\"    Mr. Pett interposed. He was always nervously apprehensive of a  clash between these two. Ann had red hair and the nature which  generally goes with red hair. She was impulsive and quick of  tongue, and--as he remembered her father had always been--a  little too ready for combat. She was usually as quickly  remorseful as she was quickly pugnacious, like most persons of  her colour. Her offer to type the story which now lay on her desk  had been the amende honourable following on just such a scene  with her aunt as this promised to be. Mr. Pett had no wish to see  the truce thus consummated broken almost before it had had time  to operate.    \"I could give the boy a job in my office,\" he suggested.    Giving young men jobs in his office was what Mr. Pett liked doing  best. There were six brilliant youths living in his house and  bursting with his food at that very moment whom he would have  been delighted to start addressing envelopes down-town.    Notably his wife's nephew, Willie Partridge, whom he looked on as  a specious loafer. He had a stubborn disbelief in the explosive  that was to revolutionise war. He knew, as all the world did,  that Willie's late father had been a great inventor, but he did  not accept the fact that Willie had inherited the dead man's  genius. He regarded the experiments on Partridgite, as it was to  be called, with the profoundest scepticism, and considered that  the only thing Willie had ever invented or was likely to invent  was a series of ingenious schemes for living in fatted idleness  on other people's money.    \"Exactly,\" said Mrs. Pett, delighted at the suggestion. \"The very  thing.\"    \"Will you write and suggest it?\" said Mr. Pett, basking in the  sunshine of unwonted commendation.    \"What would be the use of writing? Eugenia would pay no  attention. Besides, I could not say all I wished to in a letter.  No, the only thing is to go over to England and see her. I shall  speak very plainly to her. I shall point out what an advantage it  will be to the boy to be in your office and to live here. . . .\"    Ann started.    \"You don't mean live here--in this house?\"    \"Of course. There would be no sense in bringing the boy all the  way over from England if he was to be allowed to run loose when  he got here.\"    Mr. Pett coughed deprecatingly.    \"I don't think that would be very pleasant for Ann, dear.\"    \"Why in the name of goodness should Ann object?\"    Ann moved towards the door.    \"Thank you for thinking of it, uncle Peter. You're always a dear.  But don't worry about me. Do just as you want to. In any case I'm  quite certain that you won't be able to get him to come over  here. You can see by the paper he's having far too good a time in  London. You can call Jimmy Crockers from the vasty deep, but will  they come when you call for them?\"    Mrs. Pett looked at the door as it closed behind her, then at her  husband.    \"What do you mean, Peter, about Ann? Why wouldn't it be pleasant  for her if this Crocker boy came to live with us?\"    Mr. Pett hesitated.    \"Well, it's like this, Nesta. I hope you won't tell her I told  you. She's sensitive about it, poor girl. It all happened before  you and I were married. Ann was much younger then. You know what  schoolgirls are, kind of foolish and sentimental. It was my fault  really, I ought to have . . .\"    \"Good Heavens, Peter! What are you trying to tell me?\"    \"She was only a child.\"    Mrs. Pett rose in slow horror.    \"Peter! Tell me! Don't try to break it gently.\"    \"Ann wrote a book of poetry and I had it published for her.\"    Mrs. Pett sank back in her chair.    \"Oh!\" she said--it would have been hard to say whether with  relief or disappointment. \"Whatever did you make such a fuss for?  Why did you want"]]]
