They cut a great number of canes, which they tie up      into faggots, part of which they fasten together sideways,      and over these they lay a few crossways, binding all close      together, and then launching it into the water.[5]    We learn from various authors that cage-like coffins were constructed of  canes and reeds something after the wattle style; and hampers, cages for  animals, chests for treasures or regalia, biers, carrying chairs, fish  baskets, beds and seats were often similarly made. These articles, being  generally light and portable, and constructed of delicate parts, can as  well be classed with basketry as with wattle work.       [1] Hist. Virginia, John Smith.

Perhaps no branch of the textile art was of greater importance to the  aborigines than basketry. This term may be made to cover all woven  articles of a portable kind which have sufficient rigidity to retain  definite or stable form without distention by contents or by other  extraneous form of support. It will readily be seen that in shape,  texture, use, size, etc., a very wide range of products is here to be  considered. Basketry includes a number of groups of utensils  distinguished from one another by the use to which they are devoted.  There are baskets proper, hampers, cradles, shields, quivers, sieves,  etc. There is frequent historical mention of the use of basketry, but  the descriptions of form and construction are meager. An excellent idea  of the ancient art can be gained from the art of the present time, and  there is every reason to believe that close correspondence exists  throughout.      BASKETS.    Lawson refers to basket-making and other textile arts of the Carolina  Indians in the following language:        The Indian women's work is to cook the victuals for the whole      family, and to make mats, baskets, girdles, of possum hair,      and such like. * * *        The mats the Indian women make are of rushes, and about five      feet high, and two fathom long, and sewed double, that is,      two together; whereby they become very commodious to lay      under our beds, or to sleep on in the summer season in the      day time, and for our slaves in the night.        There are other mats made of flags, which the Tuskeruro      Indians make, and sell to the inhabitants.        The baskets our neighboring Indians make are all made of a      very fine sort of bullrushes, and sometimes of silk grass,      which they work with figures of beasts, birds, fishes, &c.        A great way up in the country, both baskets and mats are made      of the split reeds, which are only the outward shining part      of the cane. Of these I have seen mats, baskets, and dressing      boxes, very artificially done.[6]    James Adair, although, a comparatively recent writer, gives such  definite and valuable information regarding the handiwork of the  Southern Indians that the following extracts may well be made. Speaking  of the Cherokees, he remarks:        They make the handsomest clothes baskets, I ever saw,      considering their materials. They divide large swamp canes,      into long, thin, narrow splinters, which they dye of several      colours, and manage the workmanship so well, that both the      inside and outside are covered with a beautiful variety of      pleasing figures; and, though for the space of two inches      below the upper edge of each basket, it is worked into one,      through the other parts they are worked asunder, as if they      were two joined a-top by some strong cement. A large nest      consists of eight or ten baskets, contained within each      other. Their dimensions are different, but they usually make      the outside basket about a foot deep, a foot and an half      broad, and almost a yard long.[7]    This statement could in most respects be made with equal truth and  propriety of the Cherokee work of the present time; and their  pre-Columbian art must have been even more pleasing, as the following  paragraph suggests:        The Indians, by reason of our supplying them so cheap with      every sort of goods, have forgotten the chief part of their      ancient mechanical skill, so as not to be well able now, at      least for some years, to live independent of us. Formerly,      those baskets which the Cheerake made, were so highly      esteemed even in South Carolina, the politest of our      colonies, for domestic usefulness, beauty, and skilful      variety, that a large nest of them cost upwards of a      moidore.[8]    That there was much uniformity in the processes and range of products  and uses throughout the country is apparent from statements made by  numerous writers. Speaking of the Louisiana Indians, Du Pratz says:        The women likewise make a kind of hampers to carry corn,      flesh, fish, or any other thing which they want to transport      from one place to another; they are round, deeper than broad,      and of all sizes. * * * They make baskets with long lids that      roll doubly over them, and in these they place their earrings      and pendants, their bracelets, garters, their ribbands for      their hair, and their vermillion for painting themselves, if      they have any, but when they have no vermillion they boil      ochre, and paint themselves with that.[9]    It happens that few baskets have been recovered from mounds and graves,  but they are occasionally reported as having been discovered in caverns  and shelters where conditions were especially favorable to their  preservation. Such specimens may as reasonably be attributed to the  mound-building as to the other Indians. The following statement is from  John Haywood:        On the south side of Cumberland river, about 22 miles above      Cairo, * * * is a cave * * *. In this room, near about the      center, were found sitting in baskets made of cane, three      human bodies; the flesh entire, but a little shrivelled, and      not much so. The bodies were those of a man, a female and a      small child. The complexion of all was very fair, and white,      without any intermixture of the copper colour. Their eyes      were blue; their hair auburn, and fine. The teeth were very      white, their stature was delicate, about the size of the      whites of the present day. The man was wrapped in 14 dressed      deer skins. The 14 deer skins were wrapped in what those      present called blankets. They were made of bark, like those      found in the cave in White county. The form of the baskets      which inclosed them, was pyramidal, being larger at the      bottom, and declining to the top. The heads of the skeletons,      from the neck, were above the summits of the blankets.[10]      SIEVES AND STRAINERS.    It is apparent that baskets of open construction were employed as sieves  in pre-Columbian as well as in post-Columbian times. Almost any basket  could be utilized on occasion for separating fine from coarse particles  of food or other pulverulent substances, but special forms were  sometimes made for the purpose, having varying degrees of refinement to  suit the material to be separated.    Bartram mentions the use of a sieve by the Georgia Indians in straining  a \"cooling sort of jelly\" called conti, made by pounding certain roots  in a mortar and adding water.    Butel-Dumont describes the sieves and winnowing fans of the Louisiana  Indians. The Indian women, he says, make very fine sieves--        With the skin which they take off of the canes; they also      make some with larger holes, which serve as bolters, and      still others without holes, to be used as winnowing fans. * *      * They also make baskets very neatly fashioned, cradles for      holding maize; and with the tail feathers of turkeys, which      they have much skill in arranging, they make fans not only      for their own use, but which even our French women do not      disdain to use.[11]    Le Page Du Pratz says that \"for sifting the flour of their maiz, and  for other uses, the natives make sieves of various finenesses of the splits  of cane;\"[12] and a similar use by the Indians of Virginia is recorded by  John Smith:        They use a small basket for their Temmes, then pound againe      the great, and so separating by dashing their hand in the      basket, receive the flowr in a platter of wood scraped to      that forme with burning and shels.[13]    From Hakluyt we have the following:        Their old wheat they firste steepe a night in hot water, and      in the morning pounding yt in a morter, they use a small      baskett for the boulter or searser, and when they have syfted      fourth the finest, they pound againe the great, and so      separating yt by dashing their hand in the baskett, receave      the flower in a platter of wood, which, blending with water,      etc.[14]      CRADLES.    That cradles of textile construction were used by the mound-builders may  be taken for granted. The following is from Du Pratz, who is speaking of  the work of the inhabitants of the lower Mississippi:        This cradle is about two feet and a half long, nine inches      broad. It is skillfully made of straight canes of the length      desired for the cradle, and at the end they are cut in half      and doubled under to form the foot. The whole is only half a      foot high. This cradle is very light, weighing only two      pounds. * * * The infant being rocked lengthwise, its head is      not shaken"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19946"],[0,"Villa Elsa (#3)"],[1," that Gard could in Deutschland improve his German  which, notwithstanding his affection for his preceptor, was  indifferent. Its gutturalness grated on his nerves, antagonized him.  But he criticized himself for this, not the language. Had not his  old mentor always sung of the superiorities of that tongue?    Kirtley could improve, too, his fingering on the piano by  familiarizing himself with the noble melodies that flooded the  German land. Two hairy hands would go up in exultation,    \"To hear Beethoven and Wagner in their own country, filling the  atmosphere with their glories! And then Goethe and Schiller. Those  mighty deities. To read them in their own home!\"    But the greatest thing, to the old professor's mind, would be to  behold the German people themselves, study them, profit by them in  their preeminence. What an example, what an inspiration, what a  grand symphony of concentrated harmony! Germany was the source of  Protestantism and therefore of modern morals--honest, uncompromising  morals. German discipline would have a bracing, solidifying effect  on a typically casual, slack American youth like Gard, whose latent  capabilities were never likely to be fully called upon in the  comparatively hit-and-miss organization of Yankee life.    For he had not yet begun to find himself. He had not even decided on  a calling at an age when the German is almost a full-fledged  citizen, shouldering all the accompanying obligations. Kirtley's  exemplary conduct and the gravity cast over him by the death of his  loved ones, had led him to think a little of Rebner's suggestions  about the ministry. And for this, Luther's country would be expected  to be sublime.    The loudly reiterated praise of Germany and the Germans had at last  produced the desired effect on Gard. He was prevailed upon to break  away from the old associations, go abroad for a year and get a fresh  and stout hold on the future. Rebner, through his connections, had  been able to arrange for a home in Saxony for his pupil's sojourn.  It was in \"a highly estimable and well-informed family\" who had  never taken a paying guest. Although a new experience for them, they  had urgently insisted that they would do everything they could to  make his stay agreeable and beneficial. This was deemed most lucky.  For the real German character and existence could there be observed  and lived with the best profit, uncontaminated by the intermixture  of doubtful foreign associations.    And so Gard had arrived in Dresden, in whose attractive suburb of  Loschwitz, on the gently rising banks of the Elbe, the worthy  Buchers were domiciled. As his limping German did not give him  confidence about the up-and-down variety of the Saxon dialect, he  did not venture this afternoon to find his way by tram to the house.  The blind German script in which his hosts' solicitous and minute  instructions were couched, and the funny singsong of the natives  talking blatantly about him, made him feel still more helpless. He  sought refuge in an open droschke. He could then, too, enjoy the  drive across the city.    The Saxon capital sits capaciously like a comfortable old dowager  fully dressed in stuffs of a richly dull color. Her thick skirts are  spread about her with a contented dignity which does not interfere  with her eating large sandwiches openly and vigorously at the opera.  To-day the mellow sunlight crowned her ancient nobleness with a  becoming hue, as Gard was jogged along in a roundabout way through  the city. Here at the left were the august bridges and great park,  all famed in Napoleon's battles. Over there were the dowdy royal  palaces. There, too, was the house of the sacred Sistine. Her sweet  lineaments shone down in almost every American parlor Gard knew.    The dingy baroque architecture, whose general tastelessness was  heavily banked up by a multitude of towers, gables and high copings,  suggested an old-fashioned residential city of the days of urban  fortifications. The uniform arrays of buildings, all pretending to  the effect of sumptuousness thickened by weighty proportions and  blasphemed by rococo hesitations and doubts, seemed constructed to  exalt the doughty glory of Augustus the Strong--Dresden's local  Thor, its chief heroic figure in the favorite Teuton galaxy of  muscled Titans. Somber medieval squares, blocked away quaintly from  the world, were relieved by the celebrated Bruehl Terrace, enlivened  by gilded statuary and by historic and literary memories.    Through all this metropolis of formidable and dun respectability  curved the Elbe as if to round off the massive imitations of  something better somewhere else. Hither coursed the smooth brown  stream from Bohemia, not far away, through the high fastnesses of  the Erz range and the groomed vistas of Saxon Switzerland, and past  the frowning old fortress of Koenigstein, towering near a thousand  feet above its untroubled bosom. Kirtley was to find the river, with  its carefully tended shores, a companion in many an hour.          CHAPTER IV    VILLA ELSA      Such in brief was the scene that stretched out around him and  enveloped his attention and interest. There was not majesty that  would offend, but rather a cosy formality that is the absence of  style. It cured somewhat the homesick inclinations that quite  naturally haunted him after a wearying day of travel and as  nightfall drew down about his loneliness. He was bound for the  home of a strange family, speaking a tongue in which he was far  from glib. It had been written, though, that the Bucher young  people had learned English pretty well at school.    Kirtley reached his destination to find that the parents were  waiting expectantly to receive him. With German consciousness, they  were stuffily attired for this novel and important event. After  staunch greetings he was led into the house past a big angry dog  that stood guard tempestuously at the door. Gard found later that  such savage barking was quite a feature of the Teuton threshold, and  might be considered one bristling aspect or cause of the ungenial  development of the social spirit in Germany. _Cave canem_ can hardly  be called a suitable first attraction toward the spread of  hospitality. He feared he was going to be bitten and wished his  welcome had not been complicated with shudders.    The entrance to Villa Elsa consisted of a hallway swimming in heady  odors from the strong cooking in the adjacent kitchen. Kirtley stood  for a moment stifled. But he was to become more used to the lusty  smells that roam about, presumptuous and fortifying, in German  households and of which, indeed, all German existence is resolutely  redolent. Strength, whether in barking dogs or fumes or what-not,  appeals to the race.    In the passage-way, too, Gard was struck by the presence of various  weapons, and shields, hunting horns, sundry pairs of large boots,  military or shooting garments, belts loaded with cartridges. It  seemed almost like the combative entry to some museum of armor.  Taken together with the embattled dog, it suggested a defended  fortress rather than a peaceful fireside.    \"How pugnacious!\" Gard declared to himself.    In the entry Ernst was called, and he came promptly forth, a smiling  lad of fifteen, with a musing face, his thick light hair thrown back  and run through meditatively by his fingers. He conducted Gard up  two flights to a good-sized but snug room where he was to abide. A  linden tree courted the window panes with its green branches.    Just the place for a fellow who wants to get away from the world and  read!--Kirtley thought.    On his nightstand lay, with characteristic Teuton foresight, the  names and addresses of a language teacher and of a music teacher  who were duly \"recommending themselves\" to him in the German idiom.  Lists of purchasable text books and musical editions from houses  which, in the thoroughly informed Teuton manner, had got wind of  his coming, also opened before him.    \"They evidently expect me to begin to-morrow morning. No loss of  time.\" He laughed to himself.    His trunk and satchel were in his room in a few minutes with all the  certainty and punctuality of the imperial-royal service. \"_Essen  fertig!_\" was soon vociferated up the stairway by the cook Tekla,  whose bulky young form Gard had glimpsed in the kitchen. Not sure of  being summoned he did not emerge until Ernst tapped on the door--    \"Meester Kirtley, please come to eating.\"    At table the elder son was introduced--Rudolph, called Rudi, a youth  of about Gard's age. There was an unseemly scar on his face and  something oblique in his look. Engineering was given as his  profession, but he affected the German military strut and was  forward and crammed with ready-made conclusions on most subjects.  But Herr Bucher reigned here as elsewhere about Villa Elsa as  absolute master. He alone spoke with authority. Reverence was  first of all due him. Gard soon saw how the wife and children,  notwithstanding their stirring presences, were on a secondary plane.  How different in the land where he had come from where they are  quite free to rule in the house! The sturdy Frau was submissive,  energetically helpful. But in her husband's absence she assumed his  stentorian command.    The manner of eating was frankly informal and ungainly. Evidences of  sharp discipline one moment; the next, awkward short-cuts. The  Germans have never been able to harmonize these extremes into a  medium of easy formality or sightly smoothness. At the Bucher table  each one reached across for the food with scarce an apology--a plan  jerkily interrupted at times by Tekla, who stuck things at Gard as  if she were going to hit him. The strong provender heaped up in  abundance, rank in smell and usually unappetizing in color,  interfered at first with his hunger. And the drinking was, of  course, of a copiousness he had little dreamed of.    The whole effect created a"]]]
