Chopin's want of confidence in the judgment of his countrymen showed  that, after all, the national Polish element in his compositions was  not the main cause why they were not rated at once at their true  value. It was their novelty of form, harmonic depth and freedom of  modulation, that made them for a long time caviare to the general.  This was again proved when he went to Paris. Chopin was a Pole only on  his mother's side, his father having been a Frenchman, who had  emigrated to Poland. It might have been supposed, therefore, that  there would be a French element in Chopin's genius which would make it  palatable to the Parisians. But this did not prove to be the case. In  the remarkable group of musicians, poets, and artists who were  assembled at that time in Paris, and who mutually inspired one  another--a group which included Liszt, Meyerbeer, Hiller,  Mendelssohn, Berlioz, Heine, George Sand, the Countess D'Agoult,  Delacroix, etc.--there were no doubt not a few who knew what a rare  genius their friend Chopin was. George Sand wrote in her  autobiography: \"He has not been understood hitherto, and to the  present day he is underestimated. Great progress will have to be made  in taste and in the appreciation of music before it will be possible  for Chopin's work to become popular.\" Heine also wrote that his  favorite pianist was Chopin, \"who, however,\" he adds, \"is more of a  composer than a virtuoso. When Chopin is at the piano I forget all  about the technical side of playing and become absorbed in the sweet  profundity, the sad loveliness of his creations, which are as deep as  they are elegant. Chopin is the great inspired tone-poet who properly  should be named only in company with Mozart, Beethoven, and Rossini.\"    But aside from these select spirits and a small circle of aristocratic  admirers, mostly Poles, Chopin was not understood by the Paris public.  At first he could not even make his living there, and was in  consequence on the point of emigrating to America when a friend  dragged him to a _soiree_ at Rothschild's, where his playing was so  much admired that he was at once engaged as a teacher by several  ladies present. In a very short time he became the fashionable teacher  in aristocratic circles, where his refined manners made him  personally liked. As he refused to take any but talented pupils,  teaching was not so irksome to him as it might have been. Nevertheless  one cannot but marvel at the obtuseness of the Parisians who put into  the utilitarian harness an artist who might have enchanted them every  evening with a concert, had their taste been more cultivated. He _did_  play once, when he first arrived, but the receipts did not even meet  the expenses, and the audience received his work so coldly that his  artistic sensibilities were wounded, and he did not again appear in  public for fourteen years. Occasionally he played for the select  aristocratic circles into which he had been introduced; but even here  he did not often meet with the genuine appreciation and sympathy which  the artist craves. \"Whoever could read in his face,\" says Liszt,  \"could see how often he felt convinced that among all these handsome,  well-dressed gentlemen, among all the perfumed, elegant ladies, not  one understood him.\"    As for the French critics they seem to have been as obtuse as their  German colleagues. To give only one instance: M. Fetis, author of the  well-known musical dictionary, states in his article on Chopin, that  this composer is overrated to-day, and his popularity largely due to  the fact that he is fashionable. And in his article on Heller, he  asserts, more pointedly still, that \"the time will undoubtedly come  when the world will recognize that Heller, much more than Chopin, is  the modern poet of the pianoforte.\" In this opinion Fetis probably  stands alone; but many who have not studied Chopin's deepest works  carefully, are still convinced that the pianoforte compositions of  Mozart, Beethoven, and Schumann, are of greater importance than  Chopin's. So far am I from sharing this opinion that if I had to  choose between never again hearing a pianoforte piece by any or all of  those composers, or never again hearing a Chopin composition, I should  decide in favor of Chopin. Some years ago I expressed my conviction,  in _The Nation_, that Chopin is as distinctly superior to all other  piano composers as Wagner is to all other opera composers. A  distinguished Cincinnati musician, Mr. Otto Singer, was horrified at  this statement, and wrote in _The Courier_, of that city, that it  could only have been made by \"a patriotically inclined Frenchman or a  consumptive inhabitant of Poland;\" adding that \"he would readily yield  up possession of quite a number of Chopin's bric-a-brac for Schumann's  single 'Warum.'\" I am neither a patriotic Frenchman nor a consumptive  Pole, and I am a most ardent admirer of Schumann; nevertheless I  uphold my former opinion, and my chief object in this essay is to  endeavor to justify it.    All authorities, in the first place, admit that Chopin created an  entirely new style of playing the pianoforte. Many have pointed out  the peculiarities of this style--the use of extended and scattered  chords, the innovations in fingering which facilitate _legato_  playing, the spray of dainty little ornamental notes, the use of the  capricious _tempo rubato_, and so on. But it has not been made  sufficiently clear by any writer how it was that Chopin became the  Wagner of the pianoforte, so to speak, by revealing for the first time  the infinite possibilities of varied and beautiful tone-colors  inherent in that instrument. To understand this point fully, it is  necessary to bear in mind a few facts regarding the history of the  pianoforte.    The name of pianoforte was given about a century and a half ago to an  instrument constructed by the Italian Cristofori, who devised a  mechanism for striking the strings with hammers. In the older  instruments--the clarichords and harpsichords--the strings were either  snapped by means of crow's quills, or pushed with a tangent. The new  hammer action not only brought a better tone out of the string, but  enabled the pianist to play any note loud or soft at pleasure; hence  the name _piano-forte_. But the pianoforte itself required many years  before all its possibilities of tone-production were discovered. The  instruments used by Mozart still had a thin short tone, and there was  no pedal for prolonging it, except a clumsy one worked with the  knee--a circumstance which greatly influenced Mozart's style, and is  largely responsible for the fact that his pianoforte works are hardly  ever played to-day in the concert hall. For, as the tone could not be  sustained, it was customary in Mozart's time to hide its meagre frame  by means of a great profusion of runs and trills, and other ornaments,  with which even the slow movements were disfigured. Under the  circumstances, these ornaments were justifiable to some extent, but  to-day they seem not only in bad taste, but entirely superfluous,  because our improved instruments have a much greater power of  sustaining tones.    Czerny, the famous piano teacher, touched in his autobiography on the  peculiarities of Mozart's style. Beethoven, who gave Czerny some  lessons on the piano, made him pay particular attention to the  _legato_, \"of which,\" says Czerny, \"he was so unrivalled a master, but  which at that time--the Mozart period, when the short staccato touch  was in fashion--_all other pianists thought impossible_. Beethoven  told me afterwards,\" he continues, \"that he had often heard Mozart,  whose style from his use of the clavecin, the pianoforte being in his  time in its infancy, was not at all adapted to the newer instrument. I  have known several persons who had received instruction from Mozart,  and their playing corroborated this statement.\"    In view of these facts, we can understand why Beethoven did not like  Mozart's pianoforte works as well as those of Clementi, in which there  was more _cantabile_, and which required more fulness of tone in the  execution; and we can understand why even so conservative a critic as  Louis Ehlert should exclaim, apropos of Chopin's \"entirely new  pianoforte life,\" \"How uninteresting is the style of any previous  master (excepting Beethoven) compared with his! What a litany of  gone-by, dead-alive forms! What a feelingless, prosaic jingle! If  anyone should, without a grimace, assure me sincerely that he can play  pianoforte pieces by Clementi, Dussek, Hummel, and Ries, with real  enjoyment even now, I will esteem him as an excellent man--yes, a very  honest one; but I will not drink wine with him.\"    Were it not for what I have ventured to call the fetish of Jumboism, I  am convinced that Professor Ehlert would have written Mozart's name in  this last sentence in place of Clementi's. By excepting Beethoven  alone from the list of \"uninteresting\" composers preceding Chopin, he  _implicitly_ condemns Mozart; but he does not dare to do so  _explicitly_, although such a confession would not have affected  Mozart's greatness in other departments of music, which is undeniable.  Indeed, if Professor Ehlert had been perfectly sincere I am not quite  sure that he would have excepted Beethoven's sonatas. Although they  teem with great and beautiful ideas, these sonatas are not really  adapted to the intrinsic nature of the pianoforte, and hence fail to  arouse the enthusiasm of those whose taste has been formed by the  works of Chopin and Schumann. It was no doubt an instinctive antipathy  to Beethoven's unpianistic style (if the adjective be permissible),  which "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18564"],[0,"The Religion of Ancient Rome (#3)"],[1,"nearly always denotes an Etruscan[3] or at any rate a non-Roman origin.  There were, however, altars in special places to particular deities,  built sometimes of stone, sometimes in a more homely manner of earth or  sods. We hear for instance of the altar of Mars in the Campus Martius,  of Quirinus on the Quirinal, of Saturnus at the foot of the Capitol,  and notably of the curious underground altar of Consus on what was  later the site of the Circus Maximus. But more characteristic than the  erection of altars is the connection of deities with special  localities. Naturally enough in the worship of the household Vesta had  her seat at the hearth, Ianus at the door, and the 'gods of the  storehouse' (_Penates_) at the cupboard by the hearth, but the same  idea appears too in the state-cult. Hilltops, groves, and especially  clearings in groves (_luci_) are the most usual sacred localities. Thus  Quirinus has his own sacred hill, Iuppiter is worshipped on the  Capitol, Vesta and Iuno Lucina have their sacred groves within the  boundaries of the city, and Dea Dia, Robigus, and Furrina similar  groves at the limits of Roman territory. The record of almost every  Roman cult reveals the importance of locality in connection with the  _di indigetes_, and the localities are usually such as would be  naturally chosen by a pastoral and agricultural people.    Such were roughly the main outlines of the genuine Roman 'theology.'  It has no gods of human form with human relations to one another,  interested in the life of men and capable of the deepest passions of  hatred and affection towards them, such as we meet, for instance, in  the mythology of Greece, but only these impersonal individualities, if  we may so call them, capable of no relation to one another, but able to  bring good or ill to men, localised usually in their habitations, but  requiring no artificial dwelling or elaborate adornment of their abode;  becoming gradually more and more specialised in function, yet gaining  thereby no more real protective care for their worshippers--a cold and  heartless hierarchy, ready to exact their due, but incapable of  inspiring devotion or enthusiasm. Let us ask next how the Romans  conceived of their own relations towards them.    =2. The Relation of Gods and Men.=--The character of the Roman was  essentially practical and his natural mental attitude that of the  lawyer. And so in his relation towards the divine beings whom he  worshipped there was little of sentiment or affection: all must be  regulated by clearly understood principles and carried out with formal  exactness. Hence the _ius sacrum_, the body of rights and duties in the  matter of religion, is regarded as a department of the _ius publicum_,  the fundamental constitution of the state, and it is significant, as  Marquardt has observed, that it was Numa, a king and lawgiver, and not  a prophet or a poet, who was looked upon as the founder of the Roman  religion. Starting from the simple general feeling of a dependence on a  higher power (_religio_), which is common to all religions, the Roman  gives it his own characteristic colour when he conceives of that  dependence as analogous to a civil contract between man and god. Both  sides are under obligation to fulfil their part: if a god answers a  man's prayer, he must be repaid by a thank-offering: if the man has  fulfilled 'his bounden duty and service,' the god must make his return:  if he does not, either the cause lies in an unconscious failure on the  human side to carry out the exact letter of the law, or else, if the  god has really broken his contract, he has, as it were, put himself out  of court and the man may seek aid elsewhere. In this notion we have the  secret of Rome's readiness under stress of circumstances, when all  appeals to the old gods have failed, to adopt foreign deities and cults  in the hope of a greater measure of success.    The contract-notion may perhaps appear more clearly if we consider one  or two of the normal religious acts of the Roman individual or state.  Take first of all the performance of the regular sacrifices or acts of  worship ordained by the state-calendar or the celebration of the  household _sacra_. The _pietas_ of man consists in their due  fulfilment, but he may through negligence omit them or make a mistake  in the ritual to be employed. In that case the gods, as it were, have  the upper hand in the contract and are not obliged to fulfil their  share, but the man can set himself right again by the offering of a  _piaculum_, which may take the form either of an additional sacrifice  or a repetition of the original rite. So, for instance, when Cato is  giving his farmer directions for the lustration of his fields, he  supplies him at the end with two significant formulae: 'if,' he says,  'you have failed in any respect with regard to all your offerings, use  this formula: \"Father Mars, if thou hast not found satisfaction in my  former offering of pig, sheep, and ox (the most solemn combination in  rustic sacrifices), then let this offering of pig and sheep and ox  appease thee\": but if you have made a mistake in one or two only of  your offerings, then say, \"Father Mars, because thou hast not found  satisfaction in that pig (or whatever it may be), let this pig appease  thee.\"' On the other hand, for intentional neglect, there was no  remedy: the man was _impius_ and it rested with the gods to punish him  as they liked (_deorum iniuriae dis curae_).    But apart from the regularly constituted ceremonies of religion, there  might be special occasions on which new relations would be entered into  between god and man. Sometimes the initiative would come from man:  desiring to obtain from the gods some blessings on which he had set  his heart, he would enter into a _votum_, a special contract by which  he undertook to perform certain acts or make certain sacrifices, in  case of the fulfilment of his desire. The whole proceeding is strictly  legal: from the moment when he makes his vow the man is _voti reus_, in  the same position, that is, as the defendant in a case whose decision  is still pending; as soon as the gods have accomplished their side of  the contract he is _voti damnatus_, condemned, as it were, to damages,  having lost his suit; nor does he recover his independence until he has  paid what he undertook: _votum reddidi lubens merito_ ('I have paid my  vow gladly as it was due') is the characteristic wording of votive  inscriptions. If the gods did not accomplish the wish, the man was of  course free, and sometimes the contract would be carried so far that a  time-limit for their action would be fixed by the maker of the vow:  legal exactness can hardly go further.    Or again, the initiative might come from the gods. Some marked  misfortune, an earthquake, lightning, a great famine, a portentous  birth, or some such occurrence would be recognised as a _prodigium_, or  sign of the god's displeasure. Somehow or other the contract must have  been broken on the human side and it was the duty of the state to see  to the restoration of the _pax deum_, the equilibrium of the normal  relation of god and man. The right proceeding in such a case was a  _lustratio_, a solemn cleansing of the people--or the portion of the  people involved in the god's displeasure--with the double object of  removing the original reason of misfortune and averting future causes  of the divine anger. The commercial notion is not perhaps quite so  distinct here, but the underlying legal relationship is sufficiently  marked.    If then the question be asked whether the relation between the Roman  and his gods was friendly or unfriendly, the correct answer would  probably be that it was neither. It was rather what Aristotle in  speaking of human relations describes as 'a friendship for profit': it  is entered into because both sides hope for some advantage--it is  maintained as long as both sides fulfil their obligations.    =3. Ceremonial.=--It has been said sometimes that the old Roman  religion was one of cult and ritual without dogma or belief. As we have  seen this is not in origin strictly true, and it would be fairer to say  that belief was latent rather than non-existent: this we may see, for  instance, from Cicero's dialogues on the subject of religion, where in  discussion the fundamental sense of the dependence of man on the help  of the gods comes clearly into view: in the domestic worship of the  family too cult was always to some extent 'tinged with emotion,' and  sanctified by a belief which made it a more living and in the end a  more permanent reality than the religion of the state. But it is no  doubt true that as the community advanced, belief tended to sink into  the background: development took place in cult and not in theology, so  that by the end of the Republic, to take an example, though the  festival of the Furrinalia was duly observed every year on the 25th of  July, the nature or function of the goddess Furrina was, as we learn  from Cicero, a pure matter of conjecture, and Varro tells us that her  name was known only to a few persons. Nor was it mere lapse of time  which tended to obscure theology and exalt ceremonial: their relative  position was the immediate and natural outcome of the underlying idea  of the relation of god and man. Devotion, piety--in our sense of the  term--and a feeling of the divine presence could not be enjoined or  even encouraged by the strictly legal conception on which religion was  based: the 'contract-notion' required not a 'right spirit' but right  performance. And so it comes about that in all the records we have left  of the old religion the salient feature which catches and retains our  attention is exactness of ritual. All must be performed not merely  'decently and in order,' but with the most scrupulous care alike for  every detail of the ceremonial itself, and for the surrounding  circumstances. The omission"]]]
