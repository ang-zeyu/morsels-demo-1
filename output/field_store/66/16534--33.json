All  things come to an end, however, even the circumlocution and delays of  Government offices, and by the beginning of the autumn term the removal  had been effected, and the ceremony arranged for the opening of the new  college. Naturally it was to be a great day. The Members of Parliament  for Grovebury, and the Mayor, and many other important people were to be  present, to say nothing of parents and visitors. The pupils, assembled  in the freshly color-washed dressing-rooms, greeted one another  excitedly.    \"How do you like it?\"    \"Oh, it's topping!\"    \"Beats the old place hollow!\"    \"There's room to turn around here!\"    \"And the lockers are just A1.\"    \"Have you seen the class-rooms?\"    \"Not yet.\"    \"The gym's utterly perfect!\"    \"And so is the lab.\"    \"Shame we've had to wait for it so long!\"    \"Never mind, we've got into it at last!\"    Among the numbers of girls in the capacious dressing-rooms, Ingred also  hung up her hat and coat, and passed on into the long corridor. Like the  others she was excited, interested, even a little bewildered at the  unfamiliar surroundings. It seemed extraordinary not to know her way  about, and she seized joyfully upon Nora Clifford, who by virtue of ten  minutes' experience could act cicerone.    \"We're to be in VA.,\" Nora assured her. \"All our old set, that is, except  Connie Lord and Gladys Roper and Meg Mason. I've just met Miss Strong,  and she told me. She's moved up with us, and there's a new mistress for  VB. Haven't seen her yet, but they say she's nice, though I'd rather  stick to Miss Strong, wouldn't you?\"    \"I don't know,\" temporized Ingred, screwing her mouth into a button.    \"Oh, of course! I forgot! You're not a 'Strong' enthusiast--never were!  Now _I_ like her!\"    \"It's easy enough to like anybody who favors you. Miss Strong was always  down on me somehow, and I'd rather have tried my luck with a fresh  teacher. I wonder if Miss Burd would put me in VB. if I asked her.\"    \"Of course she wouldn't! Don't be a silly idiot! I think Miss Strong's  absolutely adorable. Don't you like the decorations in the corridor?  Miss Godwin and some of the School of Art students did them. But just  wait till you've seen the lecture-hall! Here we are! Now then, what  d'you say to this?\"    The big room into which Nora ushered her companion was lighted from the  top, and the walls, distempered in buff, had been decorated with  stencils of Egyptian designs, the bright barbaric colors of which gave a  very striking effect. There was a platform at the far end, where were  placed rows of chairs for the distinguished visitors, and also pots of  palms and ferns and geraniums to add an air of festivity to the opening  ceremony. The long lines of benches in the body of the hall were already  beginning to fill with girls, their bright hair-ribbons looking almost  like a further array of flowers. Mistresses here and there were ushering  them to their places, the Kindergarten children to the front seats,  Juniors to the middle, and Seniors to the rear. Ingred and Nora,  motioned by Miss Giles to a bench about three-quarters down the room,  took their seats and talked quietly with their nearest neighbors. A  general buzz of conversation, constantly restrained by mistresses, kept  rising and then falling again to subdued whispers. In a short time the  hall was full, Miss Perry had opened the piano, and the choir leaders  had ranged themselves round her. In dead silence all the girls, big and  little, turned their eyes towards the platform. The door behind the row  of palms and ferns was opening, and Miss Burd, in scholastic cap and  gown, was ushering in the Mayor, the Mayoress, several Town Councilors  and their wives, a few clergy, the head-master of the School of Art,  and, to the place of honor in the middle, Sir James Hilton, the Member  of Parliament for Grovebury, who was to conduct the ceremony of the  afternoon. He was a pleasant, genial-looking man, and though, as he  assured his audience, he had never before had the opportunity of  addressing a room full of girls, he seemed to be able to rise to the  occasion, and made quite a capital speech.    \"You're lucky to have this handsome building in which to do your  lessons,\" he concluded. \"Our environment makes a great difference to us,  and I think it is far easier to turn out good work in the midst of  beautiful surroundings. Grovebury College has reaped a well-deserved  reputation in the past, and I trust that its hitherto excellent  standards will be maintained or even surpassed in the future. As member  for the town there's a special word I wish to say to you. Train  yourselves to be good women citizens. Some day, when you're grown up,  you will have votes, and in that way assist in the self-government of  this great nation. The better educated and the more enlightened you are,  the better fitted you will be for your civic responsibility. Every girl  who does her duty at school is helping her country, because she is  making herself efficient to serve it in some capacity. At present  England stands at a great crisis; if we are to keep up the traditions of  our forefathers we want workers, not slackers, in every department of  life. Even the smallest of those little girls sitting in the front row  can do her bit. As for you elder girls, think of yourselves as a Cadet  Corps, training for the service of the British Empire, and let every  lesson you learn be not for your own advantage, but for the good you can  do with it afterwards to the world. I have very great pleasure in  declaring this new building open.\"    After Sir James had sat down, the Mayor and several other people made  short speeches, and when all the clapping had finally subsided, the  piano struck up, and the school sang an Empire Song and the National  Anthem. Then the door at the back of the platform opened again for the  exit of the visitors, who, chatting among themselves, made their way to  Miss Burd's study to be hospitably entertained with tea and cakes. The  whole ceremony had barely occupied an hour, and it was not yet four  o'clock. The girls, in orderly files, marched from the lecture-hall, and  betook themselves first to their new form-rooms, where textbooks were  given out with preparation for the next day, and desks allotted; then,  when the great bell rang for dismissal, to the playground and  cloak-rooms, en route for home.    Ingred, with a goodly pile of fresh literature under her arm, walked  slowly downstairs. She was not in any hurry to leave the class-room, and  lingered as long as the limits of Miss Strong's patience lasted. She  knew there was a certain ordeal to be faced with her form-mates, and she  was not sure whether she wanted to put it off, or to get it over at  once.    \"Better let them know and have done with it,\" she said to herself after  a few moments' consideration on the landing. \"After all, it's my  business, not theirs!\"    It was a rather airily-defiant Ingred who strolled into the cloak-room  and put on her hat. Francie Hall, trying to thread her boot with a lace  that had lost its tag, looked up, smiled, and made room for her on the  form.    \"Cheery-ho, Ingred! How do you like our new diggings? Some removal,  this, isn't it? I must say the place looks nice. It's topping to be here  at last. By the by, I suppose you'll be getting in Rotherwood soon? Or  have you got already?\"    Ingred was stooping to lace her shoe, so perhaps the position accounted  for her stifled voice.    \"We're not going back there.\"    \"Not going back!\" Francie's tone was one of genuine amazement. \"Why, but  you said it was being done up for you, and you'd be moving before the  term started!\"    \"Well, we're not, at any rate.\"    \"What a disappointment for you!\" began Beatrice Jackson tactlessly, as  several other girls who were standing near turned and joined the group.  \"You always said you were just longing for Rotherwood.\"    \"Do the Red Cross want it again?\" queried Jess Howard.    \"No, they don't; but we're not going to live there. Where are we going  to live? At our bungalow on the moors, and I'm a weekly boarder at the  hostel. Are there any other impertinent questions you'd like to ask?  Don't all speak at once, please!\"    And Ingred, having laced both shoes, got up, seized her pile of books,  and, turning her back on her form-mates, stalked away without a good-by.  She knew she had been rude and ungracious, but she felt that if she had  stopped another moment the tears that were welling into her eyes would  have overflowed. Ingred had many good points, but she was a remarkably  proud girl. She could not bear her schoolfellows to think she had come  down in the world. She had thrown out so many hints last term about the  renewed glories of Rotherwood, that it was certainly humiliating to have  to acknowledge that all the happy expectations had come to nothing. On  the reputation of Rotherwood both she and Quenrede had held their heads  high in the school; she wondered if her position would be the same, now  that everybody knew the truth.    As a matter of fact, most of the girls giggled as she went out through  the cloak-room door.    \"My lady's in a temper!\" exclaimed Francie.    \"Lemons and vinegar!\" hinnied Jess.    \"Why did she fly out like that?\" asked Beatrice.    \"Well, really, Beatrice Jackson, after all the stupid things you said,  anybody would fly out, I should think,\" commented Verity Richmond. \"I'm  sorry for Ingred. I'd heard the Saxons can't go back to their old house.  It's hard luck on them after lending it all these years to the Red  Cross.\"    \"But _why_ aren't they going back?\"    \"Why, silly, because they can't keep it up, I suppose. If you've any  sense, you won't mention Rotherwood to Ingred again. It's evidently a  sore point. Don't for goodness sake, go rubbing it into her.\"    \"I wasn't going to!\""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18525"],[0,"On the Trail: An Outdoor Book for Girls (#3)"],[1,"own, blaze it as you go by bending down  and breaking branches of trees, underbrush, and bushes. Let the broken  branches be on the side of bush or tree in the direction you are going,  but bent down away from that side, or toward the bush, so that the  lighter underside of the leaves will show and make a plain trail. Make  these signs conspicuous and close together, for in returning, a dozen  feet without the broken branch will sometimes confuse you, especially as  everything has a different look when seen from the opposite side. By  this same token it is a wise precaution to look back frequently as you  go and impress the homeward-bound landmarks on your memory. If in your  wanderings you have branched off and made ineffectual or blind trails  which lead nowhere, and, in returning to camp, you are led astray by one  of them, do not leave the false trail and strike out to make a new one,  but turn back and follow the false trail to its beginning, for it must  lead to the true trail again. _Don't lose sight of your broken  branches._    [Illustration: Blazing the trail by bending down and breaking branches.]    If you carry a hatchet or small axe you can make a permanent trail by  blazing the trees as the woodsmen do. Kephart advises blazing in this  way: make one blaze on the side of the tree away from the camp and two  blazes on the side toward the camp. Then when you return you look for  the _one_ blaze. In leaving camp again to follow the same trail, you  look for the _two_ blazes. If you should lose the trail and reach it  again you will know to a certainty which direction to take, for two  blazes mean _camp on this side_; one blaze, _away from camp on this  side_.      =To Know an Animal Trail=    To know an animal trail from one made by men is quite important. It is  easy to be led astray by animal trails, for they are often well defined  and, in some cases, well beaten. To the uninitiated the trails will  appear the same, but there is a difference which, in a recent number of  _Field and Stream_, Mr. Arthur Rice defines very clearly in this way:  \"Men step _on_ things. Animals step _over_ or around things.\" Then again  an animal trail frequently passes under bushes and low branches of trees  where men would cut or break their way through. To follow an animal  trail is to be led sometimes to water, often to a bog or swamp, at times  to the animal's den, which in the case of a bear might not be exactly  pleasant.    [Illustration: Returning to camp by the blazed trail.    _Note the blazed trees._]      =Lost in the Woods=    We were in the wilderness of an Adirondack forest making camp for the  day and wanted to see the beaver-dam which, we were told, was on the  edge of a near-by lake. The guide was busy cooking dinner and we would  not wait for his leisure, but leaving the rest of the party, we started  off confidently, just two of us, down the perfectly plain trail. For a  short distance there was a beaten path, then, suddenly, the trail came  to an abrupt end. We looked this side and that. No trail, no appearance  of there ever having been one. With a careless wave of his arm, the  guide had said: \"Keep in that direction.\" \"That\" being to the left, to  the left we therefore turned and stormed our way through thicket and  bramble, breaking branches as we went. Sliding down declivities,  scrambling over fallen trees, dipping beneath low-hung branches, we  finally came out upon the shore of the lake and found that we had struck  the exact spot where the beaver-dam was located.    It was only a short distance from camp and it had not taken us long to  make it, but when we turned back we warmly welcomed the sight of our  blazed trail, for all else was strange and unfamiliar. Going there had  been glimpses of the water now and then to guide us, returning we had no  landmarks. Even my sense of direction, usually to be relied on and upon  which I had been tempted to depend solely, seemed to play me false when  we reached a place where our blazing was lost sight of. The twilight  stillness of the great forest enveloped us; there was no sign of our  camp, no sound of voices. A few steps to our left the ground fell away  in a steep precipice which, in going, we had passed unnoticed and which,  for the moment, seemed to obstruct our way. Then turning to the right we  saw a streak of light through the trees that looked, at first, like  water where we felt sure no water could be if we were on the right path;  but we soon recognized this as smoke kept in a low cloud by the  trees--the smoke of our camp-fire. That was our beacon, and we were soon  on the trail again and back in camp. This is not told as an adventure,  but to illustrate the fact that without a well-blazed trail it is easier  to become lost in a strange forest than to find one's way.    You may strike the trail with the one object in view of reaching your  destination as quickly as possible. This will help you to become agile  and sure-footed, to cover long distances in a short time, but it will  not allow of much observation until your mind has become alert and your  eyes trained to see quickly the things of the forests and plains, and to  read their signs correctly. Unless there is necessity for haste, it is  better to take more time and look about you as you go. To hurry over the  trail is to lose much that is of interest and to pass by unseeingly  things of great beauty. When you are new to the trail and must hurry,  you are intent only on what is just before you--usually the feet of your  guide--or if you raise your eyes to glance ahead, you notice objects  simply as things to be reached and passed as quickly as possible.  Unhurried trailing will repay you by showing you what the world of the  wild contains.    Walking slowly you can realize the solemn stillness of the forest, can  take in the effect of the gray light which enfolds all things like a  veil of mystery. You can stop to examine the tiny-leafed, creeping vines  that cover the ground like moss and the structure of the soft mosses  with fronds like ferns. You can catch the jewel-like gleam of the wood  flowers. You can breathe deeply and rejoice in the perfume of the balsam  and pine. You can rest at intervals and wait quietly for evidences of  the animal life that you know is lurking, unseen, all around you; and  you can begin to perceive the protecting spirit of the wild that hovers  over all.    To walk securely, as the woodsmen walk, without tripping, stumbling, or  slipping, use the woodsmen's method of planting the entire foot on the  ground, with toes straight ahead, not turned out. If you put your heel  down first, while crossing on a slippery log as in ordinary walking, the  natural result will be a fall. With your entire foot as a base upon  which to rest, the body is more easily balanced and the foot less likely  to slip. When people slip and fall on the ice, it is because the edge of  the heel strikes the ice first and slides. The whole foot on the ice  would not slip in the same way, and very often not at all.    Trailing does not consist merely in walking along a path or in making  one for yourself. It has a larger meaning than that and embraces various  lines of outdoor life, while it always presupposes movement of some  kind. In one sense going on the trail means going on the hunt. You may  go on the trail for birds, for animals, for insects, plants, or flowers.  You may trail a party of friends ahead of you, or follow a deer to its  drinking-place; and in all these cases you must look for the signs of  that which you seek.      =Footprints or Tracks=    In trailing animals look for footprints in soft earth, sand, or snow.  The hind foot of the muskrat will leave a print in the mud like that of  a little hand, and with it will be the fore-foot print, showing but four  short fingers, and generally the streaks where the hard tail drags  behind. Fig. 4 shows what these look like. If you are familiar with the  dog track you will know something about the footprints of the fox, wolf,  and coyote, for they are much alike. Fig. 9 gives a clean track of the  fox, but often there is the imprint of hairs between and around the  toes. A wolf track is larger and is like Fig. 8. The footprint of a deer  shows the cloven hoof, with a difference between the buck's and the  doe's. The doe's toes are pointed and, when not spread, the track is  almost heart-shaped (Fig. 7), while the buck has blunter, more rounded  toes, like Fig. 10. The two round lobes are at the back of the foot,  the other end points in the direction the deer has taken. Sometimes you  will find deer tracks with the toes spread wide apart. That means the  animal has been running. All animals' toes spread more or less when they  run. A bear track is like Fig. 11, but a large bear often leaves other  evidences of his presence than his footprints. He will frequently turn a  big log over or tear one open in his search for ants. He will stand on  his hind legs and gnaw a hole in a dead tree or tall stump, and a  bee-tree will bear the marks of his climbing on its trunk. It is  interesting to find a tree with the scars of bruin's feet, made  prominent by small knobs where his claws have sunk into the bark. Each  scar swells and stands out like one of his toes. When you see bark  scraped off the trees some distance from the ground, you may be sure  that a horned animal has passed that way. Where the trees are not far  apart a wide-horned animal, like the bull moose, scrapes the bark with  his antlers as he passes.
