Why?\" said Singh wonderingly.    \"Because he seemed to like you better than he did me.\"    \"What a shame!\" cried Singh.  \"Oh, I say, you don't mean that, do you,  Glyn, old chap?  Why, you don't know how fond he is of you.\"    \"Don't I?\"    \"No; you should hear what he says about you sometimes.\"    \"Says about me?  What does he say about me?\"    \"Oh, perhaps I oughtn't to tell you,\" said Singh, showing his white  teeth.    \"Yes, do, there's a good fellow,\" cried Glyn, catching the other by the  arm.    \"Well, he said he should be proud to see me grow up such a boy as you  are, and that my father wished me to take you for an example, for he  wanted me to become thoroughly English--oh, and a lot more like that.\"    Glyn Severn was silent, and soon after, as the two boys turned, they saw  a group of their schoolfellows coming down the field laden with bats and  stumps, while one carried a couple of iron-shod stakes round which was  rolled a stout piece of netting.    \"Here,\" said Glyn suddenly, \"let's go round the other side of the field.  Old Slegge's along with them, and he'll be getting up a quarrel again.  I don't want to fight; but if he keeps on aggravating like he did this  morning I suppose I shall have to.\"    \"But if we go now,\" said Singh, \"it will look as if we are frightened.  We seemed to run away before, only you made me come.\"    \"Oh, it doesn't matter what seems,\" cried Severn irritably.  \"We know we  are not frightened, and that's enough.  Come on.\"    The two boys began to move slowly away; but they had not gone far before  Slegge shouted after them, \"Hi, you, sirs!  I want you to come and  field.\"    \"Then want will be your master,\" said Severn between his teeth.--\"Come  on, Singh.  Don't look round.  Let's pretend we can't hear.\"    They walked steadily on for a few paces, Severn making-believe to be  talking earnestly to his companion, when:    \"Do you hear, there, you, sirs?  Come here directly.  I want you to  field!\"    \"I dare say you do; cheeky great bully!\" said Glyn softly.  \"I shan't  come and field for you.  The Doctor did not give us a holiday to-day to  come and be your slaves.\"    \"Hi, there!  Are you coming, or am I to come and fetch you?\" shouted  Slegge, without any effect, and the big lad turned to Burney and gave  him an order.  The next minute the boy, armed with a stump, came running  at full speed across the grass, shouting to the two companions to stop,  but without their paying the slightest heed or increasing their pace.    The consequence was that the lad soon overtook them, to cry, rather out  of breath, \"Did you hear the captain call to you to come and field?\"    Singh glanced at Glyn, who gave him a sharp look as he replied, \"Yes, I  heard him quite plainly.\"    The messenger stared with open eyes and mouth, as if it was beyond his  comprehension.    \"Then, why don't you come?\" he cried.    \"Because we are going up to the house,\" replied Glyn coolly, \"to our  dormitory.\"    \"That you are not,\" cried Burney.  \"The rules say that the fellows are  not to go up to their rooms between hours, and you have been here long  enough to know that.  Now then, no nonsense.  Here, you, Singh, you've  got to come and field while old Slegge practises batting, and Tompkins  has got to bowl.\"    As the boy spoke in an unpleasant dictatorial way he made a thrust at  Singh with the pointed stump he held; but quick as thought and before it  was driven home, this third-part of a wicket was wrenched from his hand  by Severn and sent flying through the air.    \"How dare you!\" shouted Burney, and he made a rush at Glyn to collar him  and make him prisoner; but before he could reach the offending lad a  foot was thrust out by Singh, over which he tripped and fell sprawling  upon his face.    \"Oh!\" he shouted, half-beside himself with rage; and, scrambling up, he  made a rush with clenched fists at the two boys, who now stood perfectly  still awaiting his onslaught.    It was a thoroughly angry charge, but not a charge home; for Burney  stopped some three or four yards short of the distance, with his rage  evaporating fast and beginning to feel quite discreet.    For quite a minute the opponents stood gazing fiercely, and then what  had threatened to become a cuffing encounter became verbal.    \"Look here,\" cried Burney, \"you two will get it for this.  What am I to  say to the captain?\"    \"Tell him to bowl for himself,\" said Singh sharply.    \"Here!  Hi!  Burney, bring 'em along!\" came from across the field and  from between Slegge's hands.  \"Tell these beggars they had better not  keep me waiting much longer!\"    \"All right!\" shouted back Burney; and then to the two lads, \"There, you  hear.  Come on at once, and as you are new chaps I won't tell on you.  You had better come, or he'll pay you out by keeping you on bowling so  that you can't go and see the show.\"    \"Yes,\" said Glyn quietly.  \"Go back and tell him what Singh said.\"    \"What!\" cried Burney, staring with wonder.  \"Tell the captain he's to  bowl for himself?\"    \"Yes,\" said Glyn coolly, \"as long as he likes.--Come along, Singh;\" and,  throwing his arm over his Indian companion's shoulder, the two lads fell  into military step and marched slowly towards the Doctor's mansion-like  house.    \"I am afraid it means a fight, Singh,\" said Glyn quietly.  \"Well, I dare  say we can get over it.  I am not going to knuckle down to that fellow.  Are you?\"    \"Am I?\" cried the boy, flashing a fierce look at his English companion.  \"What do you think?\"    Glyn laughed softly and merrily.    \"Shall I tell you?\" he said.    \"Yes, of course,\" cried the Indian boy hotly.    \"Well, I think you will.\"    \"What!\"    \"When you can't lift hand or foot, and your eyes are closing up so as  you can hardly see.\"    \"And I won't give up then!\" cried the boy passionately.    \"Well, don't get into a wax about it, old chap,\" said Glyn in a dry,  slow way.  \"I don't suppose you'll have to, for the big chuckle-headed  bully will have to lick me first, and I dare say I can manage to tire  him so that you can easily lick him in turn.\"    \"You are not going to fight him,\" cried Singh hotly.    \"Yes, I am.\"    \"You are not.  He insulted my dead father.  A mahout indeed!\"    \"So he did mine,\" said Glyn.  \"A shabby half-pay military officer  indeed!  I'll make _him_ look shabby before I have done.\"    \"Now, look here,\" cried Singh, \"don't be a beast, Glynny, and make me  more angry than I am.  I am bad enough as it is.\"    \"So am I, so don't you get putting on the Indian tyrant.  Recollect you  are in England now.  This is my job, and I know if father were here he'd  say I was to have the first go in.  He's such a big fellow that I  believe he'll lick me easily.  But, as I said before, I shall pretty  well tire him out, and then you being the reserve, he'll come at you,  and then he'll find out his mistake.  And I say, Singhy, old chap, I do  hope that my eyes won't be so closed that I can't see.  Now then, come  up to our room.  It's a holiday, and the rules won't count to-day.  Come  on, and we'll talk it over.\"    \"But--\" began Singh.    \"Now, don't be obstinate.  You promised father you'd try and give way to  me over English matters.  Now, didn't you?\"    \"Well,\" said the lad hesitatingly, \"I suppose I did.\"    \"Come on, then.  You see war's begun, and we have got to settle our plan  of campaign.\"    The young Maharajah nodded his head and smiled.    \"Yes,\" he said, \"come up to our room.  We ought to dress, oughtn't we,  to see the procession?  I say, I don't know how it is, I always like  fighting against any one who tries to bully.  I am not sorry that war  has begun.\"    \"Neither am I,\" said the English lad quietly, \"for things have been very  unpleasant ever since we came here, and when we've got this over perhaps  we shall be at peace.\"        CHAPTER THREE.    THE PRINCE'S REGALIA.    The bedroom shared by Glyn Severn and Singh was one of a series, small  and particularly comfortable, in the new annexe the Doctor had built  expressly for lecture-room and dormitories when his establishment began  to increase.    The comfortably furnished room just sufficed for two narrow beds and the  customary furniture; and as soon as the two lads had entered, Singh  hurried to his chest of drawers, unlocked one, took out a second bunch  of keys to that he carried in his pocket, and was then crossing to a  sea-going portmanteau standing in one corner, when Glyn, who was looking  very thoughtful and abstracted, followed, and as Singh knelt down and  threw open the travelling-case, laid his hand upon the lad's shoulder.  \"What are you going to do?\" he said shortly.  \"Only look out two or  three things that there's not room for in the drawer.\"    \"What for?\"    \"Why, to dress for the procession.\"    \"Stuff and nonsense!  You are quite right as you are,\" cried Glyn  half-mockingly.  \"You must learn to remember that you are in England,  where nobody dresses up except soldiers.  Why, what were you going to  do?\"    \"I was going to put on a white suit and belt.\"    \"Nonsense!\" cried Glyn.  \"This isn't India, but Devonshire.  Why, if you  were to come down dressed like that the boys would all laugh at you, and  the crowd out in the road shout and cheer.\"    \"Well, of course,\" said Singh; \"they'd see I was a prince.\"    \"Oh, what a rum fellow you are!\" cried Glyn, gripping his companion's  shoulders and laughingly shaking him to and fro.  \"I thought that I had  made you understand that now we are over here you were to dress just the  same as an English boy.  Why, don't you know that when we had a king in  England he used to dress just like any ordinary gentleman, only  sometimes he would wear a star on his breast.\"    \"Oh, but surely,\" began Singh, in a disappointed tone, \"he must have--\"    \"Yes, yes, yes; sometimes,\" cried Glyn.  \"I know what you mean.  On  state occasions, or when he"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21316"],[0,"The Adventures of Don Lavington: Nolens Volens (#3)"],[1,"grumbled.  \"Ashamed that I was ever such a stupid as to marry  a girl who's always dissatisfied.  Nice home you make me.\"    \"And a nice home you make me, sir; and don't eat your victuals so fast.  It's like being at the wild beast show.\"    \"That's right; go on,\" grumbled Jem, doubling his rate of consumption.  \"Grudge me my meals now.  Good job if we could undo it all, and be as we  was.\"    \"I wish we could,\" cried the little woman, whose eyes seemed to say that  her lips were not telling the truth.    \"So do I,\" cried Jem, tossing off his third cup of tea; and then to his  little wife's astonishment he took a thick slice of bread and butter in  each hand, clapped them together as if they were cymbals, rose from the  table and put on his hat.    \"Where are you going, Jem?\"    \"Out.\"    \"What for?\"    \"To eat my bread and butter down on the quay.\"    \"But why, Jem?\"    \"'Cause there's peace and quietness there.\"    _Bang_!  Went the door, and little Mrs Wimble stood gazing at it  angrily for a few moments before sitting down and having what she called  \"a good cry,\" after which she rose, wiped her eyes, and put away the tea  things without partaking of any herself.    \"Poor Jem!\" she said softly; \"I'm afraid I'm very unkind to him  sometimes.\"    Just at that moment Jem was sitting on an empty cask, eating his bread  and butter, and watching a boat manned by blue-jackets going off to the  sloop of war lying out toward the channel, and flying her colours in the  evening breeze.    \"Poor little Sally!\" he said to himself.  \"We don't seem to get on  somehow, and I'm afraid I'm a bit rough to her; but knives and scissors!  What a temper she have got.\"    Meanwhile, in anything but a pleasant frame of mind, Don had gone home  to find that the tea was ready, and that he was being treated as a  laggard.    \"Come, Lindon,\" said his uncle quietly, \"you have kept us waiting some  time.\"    The lad glanced quickly round the well-furnished room, bright with  curiosities brought in many a voyage from the west, and with the poison  of Mike's words still at work, he wondered how much of what he saw  rightfully belonged to him.    The next moment his eyes lit on the soft sweet troubled face of his  mother, full of appeal and reproach, and it seemed to Don that his uncle  had been upsetting her by an account of his delinquencies.    \"It's top bad, and I don't deserve it,\" he said to himself.  \"Everything  seems to go wrong now.  Well, what are you looking at?\" he added, to  himself, as he took his seat and stared across at his cousin, the  playmate of many years, whose quiet little womanly face seemed to repeat  her father's grave, reproachful look, but who, as it were, snatched her  eyes away as soon as she met his gaze.    \"They all hate me,\" thought Don, who was in that unhappy stage of a  boy's life when help is so much needed to keep him from turning down one  of the dark side lanes of the great main route.    \"Been for a walk, Don?\" said his mother with a tender look.    \"No, mother, I only stopped back in the yard a little while.\"    His uncle set down his cup sharply.    \"You have not been keeping that scoundrel Bannock?\" he cried.    \"No, sir; I've been talking to Jem.\"    \"Ho!\" ejaculated the old merchant.  \"That's better.  But you might have  come straight home.\"    Don's eyes encountered his Cousin Kitty's just then, as she gave her  head a shake to throw back the brown curls which clustered about her  white forehead.    She turned her gaze upon her plate, and he could see that she was  frowning.    \"Yes,\" thought Don, \"they all dislike me, and I'm only a worry and  trouble to my mother.  I wish I was far away--anywhere.\"    He went on with his tea moodily and in silence, paying no heed to the  reproachful glances of his mother's eyes, which seemed to him to say,  and with some reason, \"Don't be sulky, Don, my boy; try and behave as I  could wish.\"    \"It's of no use to try,\" he said to himself; and the meal passed off  very silently, and with a cold chill on every one present.    \"I'm very sorry, Laura,\" said her brother, as soon as Don had left the  room; \"and I don't know what to do for the best.  I hate finding fault  and scolding, but if the boy is in the wrong I must chide.\"    \"Try and be patient with him, Josiah,\" said Mrs Lavington pleadingly.  \"He is very young yet.\"    \"Patient?  I'm afraid I have been too patient.  That scoundrel at the  yard has unsettled him with his wild tales of the sea; and if I allowed  it, Don would make him quite a companion.\"    \"But, Josiah--\"    \"There, don't look like that, my dear.  I promised you I would play a  father's part to the boy, and I will; but you must not expect me to be a  weak indulgent father, and spoil him with foolish lenity.  There, enough  for one day.  I daresay we shall get all right in time.\"    \"Oh, yes,\" cried Mrs Lavington, earnestly.  \"He's a true-hearted, brave  boy; don't try to crush him down.\"    \"Crush him, nonsense!\" cried the merchant, angrily.  \"You really are too  bad, Laura, and--\"    He stopped, for just then Don re-entered the room to flush up angrily as  he saw his mother in tears; and he had heard enough of his uncle's  remark and its angry tone to make him writhe.    \"Ill using her now,\" he said to himself, as he set his teeth and walked  to the window.    The closing of the door made him start round quickly, to find that his  mother was close behind him, and his uncle gone.  \"What has Uncle Jos  been saying to you, mother?\" he cried angrily.    \"Nothing--nothing particular, my boy,\" she faltered.  \"He has,\" cried  Don fiercely; \"and I won't have it.  He may scold and abuse me as much  as he likes, but I will not have him ill use you.\"    \"Ill use me, Don?\" cried Mrs Lavington.  \"Nonsense, my dear boy.  Your  uncle is all that is kind and good; and he loves you very dearly, Don,  if you could only try--try a little more, my dear boy, to do what he  likes, and please him.\"    \"I do try, mother, but it's no good.\"    \"Don't say that, Don.  Try a little harder--for my sake, dear, as well  as your own.\"    \"I have tried, I am always trying, and it's of no use.  Nothing pleases  uncle, and the men in the yard know it.\"    \"Don, my boy, what foolish obstinate fit is this which has come over  you?\" said Mrs Lavington tenderly.    \"I'm not obstinate,\" he said sullenly; \"only unhappy.\"    \"Is it not your own fault, my darling?\" she whispered; \"believe me, your  uncle is one of the kindest and best of men.\"    Don shook his head.    \"Are you going to prefer the opinion of the men of the yard to mine,  dear?\"    \"No, mother, but uncle is your brother, and you believe in him and  defend him.  You know how harsh and unkind he is to me.\"    \"Not unkind, Don, only firm and for your good.  Now come, my boy, do,  for my sake, try to drive away these clouds, and let us all be happy  once more.\"    \"It's of no use to try, mother; I shall never be happy here, tied down  to a desk.  It's like being uncle's slave.\"    \"What am I to say to you, Don, if you talk like this?\" said Mrs  Lavington.  \"Believe me you are wrong, and some day you will own it.  You will see what a mistaken view you have taken of your uncle's  treatment.  There, I shall say no more now.\"    \"You always treat me as if I were a child,\" said Don, bitterly.  \"I'm  seventeen now, mother, and I ought to know something.\"    \"Yes, my boy,\" said Mrs Lavington gently; \"at seventeen we think we  know a good deal; and at forty we smile as we look back and see what a  very little that `good deal' was.\"    Don shook his head.    \"There, we will have no more sad looks.  Uncle is eager to do all he can  to make us happy.\"    \"I wish I could think so,\" cried Don, bitterly.    \"You may, my dear.  And now, come, try and throw aside all those  fanciful notions about going abroad and meeting with adventures.  There  is no place like home, Don, and you will find out some day that is  true.\"    \"But I have no home till I make one,\" said the lad gloomily.    \"You have an excellent home here, Don, the gift of one who has kindly  taken the place toward you of your father.  There, I will listen to no  more from you, for this is all foolish fighting of your worse against  your better self.\"    There was a quiet dignity in his mother's words which awed Don for the  moment, but the gentle embrace given the next minute seemed to undo that  which the firmness had achieved, and that night the cloud over the lad's  life seemed darker than ever.    \"She takes uncle's side and thinks he is everything,\" he said gloomily,  as he went to bed.  \"She means right, but she is wrong.  Oh, how I wish  I could go right away somewhere and begin life all over again.\"    Then he lay down to sleep, but slumber did not come, so he went on  thinking of many things, to fall into a state of unconsciousness at  last, from which he awoke to the fact that it was day--a very eventful  day for him, but he did not awaken to the fact that he was very blind.        CHAPTER THREE.    AN AWKWARD GUINEA.    It was a busy day at the yard, for a part of the lading of a sugar ship  was being stored away in Uncle Josiah's warehouses; but from the very  commencement matters seemed to go wrong, and the state of affairs about  ten o'clock was pretty ably expressed by Jem Wimble, who came up to Don  as he was busy with pencil and book, keeping account of the deliveries,  and said in a loud voice,--    \"What did your uncle have for breakfast, Mas' Don?\"    \"Coffee--ham--I hardly know, Jem.\"    \"Ho!  Thought p'r'aps it had been cayenne pepper.\"    \"Nonsense!\"    \"Ah, you may say that, but see how he is going it.  'Tarn't my fault  that the dock men work so badly, and 'tarn't my fault that Mike isn't  here, and--\"    \"Don't stand talking to Wimble, Lindon,\" said a voice sharply, and Uncle  Josiah came up to the pair.  \"No, don't go away, Wimble.  Did Bannock  say he should stay away to-day?\"    \"Not to me, uncle.\"    \"Nor to me, sir.\"    \"It's very"]]]
