Mere inspection does not always tell whether some feature of an  individual is more affected by changes in heredity or changes in  surroundings. On seeing a swarthy man, one may suppose that he comes of  a swarthy race, or that he is a fair-skinned man who has lived long in  the desert. In the one case the swarthiness would be inheritable, in the  other not. Which explanation is correct, can only be told by examining a  number of such individuals under critical conditions, or by an  examination of the ancestry. A man from a dark-skinned race would become  little darker by living under the desert sun, while a white man would  take on a good deal of tan.    The limited effect of nurture in changing nature is in some fields a  matter of common observation. The man who works in the gymnasium knows  that exercise increases the strength of a given group of muscles for a  while, but not indefinitely. There comes a time when the limit of a  man's hereditary potentiality is reached, and no amount of exercise will  add another millimeter to the circumference of his arm. Similarly the  handball or tennis player some day reaches his highest point, as do  runners or race horses. A trainer could bring Arthur Duffy in a few  years to the point of running a hundred yards in 9-3/5 seconds, but no  amount of training after that could clip off another fifth of a second.  A parallel case is found in the students who take a college examination.  Half a dozen of them may have devoted the same amount of time to it--may  have crammed to the limit--but they will still receive widely different  marks. These commonplace cases show that nurture has seemingly some  power to mold the individual, by giving his inborn possibilities a  chance to express themselves, but that nature says the first and last  word. Francis Galton, the father of eugenics, hit on an ingenious and  more convincing illustration by studying the history of twins.[3]    There are, everyday observation shows, two kinds of twins--ordinary  twins and the so-called identical twins. Ordinary twins are merely  brothers, or sisters, or brother and sister, who happen to be born two  at a time, because two ova have developed simultaneously. The fact that  they were born at the same time does not make them alike--they differ  quite as widely from each other as ordinary brothers and sisters do.  Identical twins have their origin in a different phenomenon--they are  believed to be halves of the same egg-cell, in which two growing-points  appeared at a very early embryonic stage, each of these developing into  a separate individual. As would be expected, these identical twins are  always of the same sex, and extremely like each other, so that sometimes  their own mother can not tell them apart. This likeness extends to all  sorts of traits:--they have lost their milk teeth on the same day in one  case, they even fell ill on the same day with the same disease, even  though they were in different cities.    Now Galton reasoned that if environment really changes the inborn  character, then these identical twins, who start life as halves of the  same whole, ought to become more unlike if they were brought up apart;  and as they grew older and moved into different spheres of activity,  they ought to become measurably dissimilar. On the other hand, ordinary  twins, who start dissimilar, ought to become more alike when brought up  in the same family, on the same diet, among the same friends, with the  same education. If the course of years shows that identical twins remain  as like as ever and ordinary twins as unlike as ever, regardless of  changes in conditions, then environment will have failed to demonstrate  that it has any great power to modify one's inborn nature in these  traits.    With this view, Galton collected the history of eighty pairs of  identical twins, thirty-five cases being accompanied by very full  details, which showed that the twins were really as nearly identical, in  childhood, as one could expect to find. On this point, Galton's  inquiries were careful, and the replies satisfactory. They are not,  however, as he remarks, much varied in character. \"When the twins are  children, they are usually distinguished by ribbons tied around the  wrist or neck; nevertheless the one is sometimes fed, physicked, and  whipped by mistake for the other, and the description of these little  domestic catastrophes was usually given by the mother, in a phraseology,  that is sometimes touching by reason of its seriousness. I have one case  in which a doubt remains whether the children were not changed in their  bath, and the presumed A is not really B, and _vice versa_. In another  case, an artist was engaged on the portraits of twins who were between  three and four years of age; he had to lay aside his work for three  weeks, and, on resuming it, could not tell to which child the respective  likeness he had in hand belonged. The mistakes become less numerous on  the part of the mother during the boyhood and girlhood of the twins, but  are almost as frequent as before on the part of strangers. I have many  instances of tutors being unable to distinguish their twin pupils. Two  girls used regularly to impose on their music teacher when one of them  wanted a whole holiday; they had their lessons at separate hours, and  the one girl sacrificed herself to receive two lessons on the same day,  while the other one enjoyed herself from morning to evening. Here is a  brief and comprehensive account: 'Exactly alike in all, their  schoolmasters could never tell them apart; at dancing parties they  constantly changed partners without discovery; their close resemblance  is scarcely diminished by age.\"    [Illustration: FOUR BABY GIRLS AT ONCE    FIG. 1.--These quadruplet daughters were born to Mr. and Mrs.  F. M. Keys, Hollis, Okla., on July 4, 1915, and were seven months old  when the photograph was taken. Up to that time they had never had any  other nourishment than their mother's milk. Their weights at birth were  as follows (reading from left to right): Roberta, 4 pounds; Mona, 4-1/2  pounds; Mary, 4-1/4 pounds; Leota, 3-3/4 pounds. When photographed,  Roberta weighed 16 pounds and each of the others weighed 16-1/4. Their  aunt vouches for the fact that the care of the four is less trouble than  a single baby often makes. The mother has had no previous plural births,  although she has borne four children prior to these. Her own mother had  but two children, a son and a daughter, and there is no record of twins  on the mother's side. The father of the quadruplets is one of twelve  children, among whom is one pair of twins. It is known that twinning is  largely due to inheritance, and it would seem that the appearance of  these quadruplets is due to the hereditary influence of the father  rather than the mother. If this is the case, then the four girls must  all have come from one egg-cell, which split up at an early stage. Note  the uniform shape of the mouth, and the ears, set unusually low on the  head.]    \"The following is a typical schoolboy anecdote:    \"'Two twins were fond of playing tricks, and complaints were frequently  made; but the boys would never own which was the guilty one, and the  complainants were never certain which of the two it was. One head master  used to say he would never flog the innocent for the guilty, and the  other used to flog them both.'    \"No less than nine anecdotes have reached me of a twin seeing his or her  reflection in the looking-glass, and addressing it in the belief that it  was the other twin in person.    \"Children are usually quick in distinguishing between their parent and  his or her twin; but I have two cases to the contrary. Thus, the  daughter of a twin says:    \"'Such was the marvelous similarity of their features, voice, manner,  etc., that I remember, as a child, being very much puzzled, and I think,  had my aunt lived much with us, I should have ended by thinking I had  two mothers!'    \"In the other case, a father who was a twin, remarks of himself and his  brother:    \"'We were extremely alike, and are so at this moment, so much so that  our children up to five and six years old did not know us apart.'    \"Among my thirty-five detailed cases of close similarity, there are no  less than seven in which both twins suffered from some special ailment  or had some exceptional peculiarity. Both twins are apt to sicken at the  same time in no less than nine out of the thirty-five cases. Either  their illnesses, to which I refer, were non-contagious, or, if  contagious, the twins caught them simultaneously; they did not catch  them the one from the other.\"    Similarity in association of ideas, in tastes and habits was equally  close. In short, their resemblances were not superficial, but extremely  intimate, both in mind and body, while they were young; they were reared  almost exactly alike up to their early manhood and womanhood.    Then they separated into different walks of life. Did this change of the  environment alter their inborn character? For the detailed evidence,  one should consult Galton's own account; we give only his conclusions:    In many cases the resemblance of body and mind continued unaltered up to  old age, notwithstanding very different conditions of life; in others a  severe disease was sufficient to account for some change noticed. Other  dissimilarity that developed, Galton had reason to believe, was due to  the development of inborn characters that appeared late in life. He  therefore felt justified in broadly concluding \"that the only  circumstance, within the range of those by which persons of similar  conditions of life are affected, that is capable of producing a marked  effect on the character of adults, is illness or some accident which  causes physical infirmity.

The other officer looked up to him with flashing eyes.    \"I gave him a receipt which he has already shown to God Himself,\" he  said, \"provided there is a God for these accursed French. My sword cleft  his skull, but I fell together with him.\"    \"Your wound here in the forehead is of no consequence,\" said the  officer; \"the stroke only cut the skin. Let us put this moistened  handkerchief on it.\"    \"Oh, now I am better,\" said the other; \"now that the wound burns less  painfully, I feel that life is circulating again through all my veins.\"    \"And what about your arm?\"    \"A lancer pierced it. I hope he was kind enough not to touch the bone,  so that the arm need not be amputated. It is true, it pains severely;  but, you see, I can move it a little, which proves that it is not  shattered. Now, comrade, do me still another favor--assist me in  rising.\"    \"Here, lean firmly on me. There! I will lift you up--now you are on your  legs again. Lean on me still, for you might become dizzy.\"    \"No, I shall not. I feel again well and strong enough to take the burden  of life on my shoulders. Thank God! I am able to stand again. For,  however crushed and trampled under foot we may be, we will submit to our  fate manfully, and stand erect. The conqueror and tyrant shall not  succeed in bending our heads, although he has broken our hearts. Ah,  comrade, that was a terrible day when all Prussia sank in ruins!\"    \"You were in the thickest of the fray? The regiment of the queen's  dragoons fought at Auerstadt, I believe?\"    \"Yes, it fought at Auerstadt, or rather it did the same as all the other  regiments--it deserted. Only a few squadrons complied with the urgent  exhortations of the king, who led us against the squares of the enemy  near Hassenhausen. His own horse was shot; we officers stood our ground,  but the dragoons ran away.[Historical] Ah, I wept with rage, and if my  tears could have been transformed into bullets, they would not have been  directed against the enemy, but against our own cowardly dragoons. The  battle would have been won if our soldiers had not disgracefully taken  to their heels. All shouts, orders, supplications, were in vain; the  soldiers were running, although no enemy pursued them; the panic had  rendered them perfectly crazy.\"    \"And do you really believe, comrade, that we owe the loss of the battle  exclusively to the cowardice of the soldiers?\" asked the officer. \"Did  our generals do their duty? Ah, you look gloomy, and do not reply. Then  you agree with me? Let us, however, speak of all these things afterward,  but first of ourselves.\"    \"Yes, first of ourselves!\" exclaimed the other, starting from his gloomy  reflections. \"Count Pueckler, you were kind enough to tell me your name,  when you relieved an unknown sufferer in so humane a manner, and thereby  saved his life. Now permit me to tell you my name, too, so that you may  know at least who will always revere your memory with affection and  gratitude. I am Second-Lieutenant Ferdinand von Schill. You see, it is a  very humble name; still I had solemnly vowed that it should not be  unknown in the battles that were to be fought.\"    \"And I see it written on your brow, comrade, that you will at some  future time make up for what fate has now prevented you from  accomplishing,\" said Count Pueckler, kindly offering his hand to  Lieutenant von Schill. \"Yet now let us not think of the future, but of  the present. We are disabled, and will be helpless as soon as the  wound-fever sets in; and we may be sure that that will be to-night. We  must, therefore, find a place of refuge; for, if we remain here, without  assistance, and without food, we shall surely be lost.\"    \"You are right; we must leave this house,\" said Schill; \"we must try to  reach a city or village. Come, let us go. You are armed, and I have got  a sabre, too. Let us go, but previously let us swear that we will not  surrender to the French, but rather die, even should it be necessary to  commit suicide! You have a knife, and when you cut some bread for me, I  saw that it was very sharp. Will you give it to me?\"    \"What for?\"    \"I want to stab myself, as soon as I see that I cannot escape from the  enemy!\"    \"And I? What is to become of me?\"    \"Before killing myself, I will stab you with my sabre. Will that content  you?\"    \"It will. Be careful, however, to hit my heart; do not merely wound, but  kill me.\"    \"Ah, I see that we understand each other, and that the same heart is  pulsating in our breast!\" exclaimed Schill, joyfully. \"Let us die,  rather than be captured by the enemy and depend on the mercy of the  Corsican tyrant! Now, comrade, let us go! For you are right; the  wound-fever will set in toward evening, and without assistance we shall  be lost.\"    \"Come,\" said Pueckler, \"place your uninjured arm in mine. It seems fate  has destined us for each other, for it has ruined your right arm and my  left arm; thus we can walk at least side by side, mutually supporting  ourselves. I shall be your right hand, and you will lend me your left  arm when I have to embrace anybody. But, it is true, no one will now  care for our embrace; every one will mock and deride us, and try to read  in the bloody handwriting on our foreheads: 'He is also one of the  vanquished Prussians!'\"    \"Comrade, did you not tell me a little while ago, that it would be  better for us to attend to our own affairs, before talking about other  matters?\"    \"It is true; let us go!\"    And, leaning on each other, the two officers left the house.          CHAPTER II.    THE GERMAN SONG.      It was a sunny morning in autumn; the two wounded officers were inhaling  the bracing air in long draughts, and their eyes were wandering over the  transparent sky and the picturesque landscape.    \"And to think that my eyes would never more have seen all this, if you  had not had mercy on me!\" said Schill, with a grateful glance at his  companion.    \"Ah, my friend,\" sighed Pueckler, mournfully, \"we shall not always behold  the sky and this beautiful, silent scene, but it may easily happen that  we shall see much misery to-day, and that you will curse your eyes for  being compelled to perceive it! Still you are right--it is better to  live, even in anguish and distress, than to die in anguish and distress;  for he who lives has still a future before him, and is able to strive in  it for revenge and compensation for the past. Let us descry our  immediate future from the hill yonder, and there decide on the direction  we shall take.\"    They walked toward the neighboring hill. Frequently they had to stop on  the way; frequently they sank down exhausted; but their will and  youthful energy overcame their weakness, and finally they reached their  destination: they stood on the summit, and were able to survey the whole  country for miles around.    \"Yonder, where that dreadful smoke is rising, is the battle-field of  Auerstadt!\" said Schill, after a long pause, during which they had taken  breath.    \"Yes, and beyond those hills is Jena,\" said Pueckler, sadly. \"Those are  two melancholy names for a Prussian ear, and, like Ulysses, I should  like to close mine so as not to hear that siren voice of death any more;  for, I tell you, whenever I hear those two names, I am driven to  despair, and would like to throw myself into that abyss!\"    \"My friend, it seems to me we are already in the abyss, and our first  and most earnest endeavors should be directed toward saving us from it,\"  said Schill, shrugging his shoulders. \"Our first step should be to get  safely through the enemy's lines, in order to escape from the dangers to  which a collision with the French would expose us. Whither shall we turn  now? Have you formed already a definite plan, count?\"    \"Being disabled from active service by my wounds, I shall repair to my  estates in Silesia, and remain there till I have recovered. And you,  comrade--will you permit me to make you an offer? If you have not yet  come to a different decision, you ought to accompany me, and stay at my  house till your wounds are healed. I have splendid woods, and facilities  for angling on my estates; and if you like hunting and fishing, I am  sure a sojourn at my house will afford you plenty of amusement.\"    \"But you forget that my right arm is wounded, count,\" said Schill, with  a melancholy smile; \"hence, I shall be but a poor companion for you, and  ought not to accept your kind offer. I confess, moreover, that my mind  is too restless, and my heart too deeply grieved, to enjoy the peace and  quiet of country life. I must remain in the noise and turmoil of the  world, and see what will become of poor Prussia. I intend going to  Kolberg; the fortress is strong and impregnable; it will be an  insurmountable bulwark against the enemy, and I have several intimate  friends at the fortress. I will stay with them till I am well again.\"    \"Our paths, then, will soon be different. You will go to the north; I,  to the east. But, for a few days, we shall still remain together, for  the wound-fever will compel us to advance very slowly. Let us look out  now for a dinner, and for a place where we may safely sleep to-night.\"    \"And, it seems to me, I see a prospect of obtaining both. Yonder,\" said  Schill, pointing with his left hand to a small point on the horizon. \"Do  you perceive that steeple? There is a village, and consequently there  are men; and, as it is situated northeast, it is in the right direction  for both of us.\"    \"You are right; we will direct our steps thither,\" exclaimed Count  Pueckler. \"May Fate be propitious to us, and keep the French out of our  path!\"    They walked down the hill on the opposite side, and then commenced  crossing, arm in arm, the stubble-field that lay stretched out before  them.
