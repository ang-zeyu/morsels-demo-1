His family  are plain people, although none the less worthy, useful, or exalted, on  that account. His structures, of every kind, should be plain, also, yet  substantial, where substance is required. All these detract nothing from  his respectability or his influence in the neighborhood, the town, the  county, or the state. A farmer has quite as much business in the field,  or about his ordinary occupations, with ragged garments, out at elbows,  and a crownless hat, as he has to occupy a leaky, wind-broken, and  dilapidated house. Neither is he any nearer the mark, with a ruffled  shirt, a fancy dress, or gloved hands, when following his plough behind  a pair of _fancy_ horses, than in living in a finical, pretending house,  such as we see stuck up in conspicuous places in many parts of the  country. All these are out of place in each extreme, and the one is as  absurd, so far as true propriety is concerned, as the other. A fitness  of things, or a correspondence of one thing with another, should always  be preserved upon the farm, as elsewhere; and there is not a single  reason why propriety and good keeping should not as well distinguish it.  Nor is there any good cause why the farmer himself should not be a man  of taste, in the arrangement and architecture of every building on his  place, as well as other men. It is only necessary that he devote a  little time to study, in order to give his mind a right direction in all  that appertains to this department. Or, if he prefer to employ the  ingenuity of others to do his planning,--which, by the way, is, in most  cases, the more natural and better course,--he certainly should possess  sufficient judgment to see that such plans be correct and will answer  his purposes.    The plans and directions submitted in this work are intended to be of  the most practical kind; plain, substantial, and applicable, throughout,  to the purposes intended, and such as are within the reach--each in  their kind--of every farmer in our country. These plans are chiefly  original; that is, they are not copied from any in the books, or from  any structures with which the writer is familiar. Yet they will  doubtless, on examination, be found in several cases to resemble  buildings, both in outward appearance and interior arrangement, with  which numerous readers may be acquainted. The object, in addition to our  own designs, has been to apply practical hints, gathered from other  structures in use, which have seemed appropriate for a work of the  limited extent here offered, and that may serve to improve the taste of  all such as, in building useful structures, desire to embellish their  farms and estates in an agreeable style of home architecture, at once  pleasant to the eye, and convenient in their arrangement.          INTRODUCTORY.      The lover of country life who looks upon rural objects in the true  spirit, and, for the first time surveys the cultivated portions of the  United States, will be struck with the incongruous appearance and style  of our farm houses and their contiguous buildings; and, although, on  examination, he will find many, that in their interior accommodation,  and perhaps relative arrangement to each other, are tolerably suited to  the business and convenience of the husbandman, still, the feeling will  prevail that there is an absence of method, congruity, and correct taste  in the architectural structure of his buildings generally, by the  American farmer.    We may, in truth, be said to have no architecture at all, as exhibited  in our agricultural districts, so far as any correct system, or plan is  concerned, as the better taste in building, which a few years past has  introduced among us, has been chiefly confined to our cities and towns  of rapid growth. Even in the comparatively few buildings in the modern  style to be seen in our farming districts, from the various requirements  of those buildings being partially unknown to the architect and builder,  who had their planning--and upon whom, owing to their own inexperience  in such matters, their employers have relied--a majority of such  dwellings have turned out, if not absolute failures, certainly not what  the necessities of the farmer has demanded. Consequently, save in the  mere item of outward appearance--and that, not always--the farmer and  cottager have gained nothing, owing to the absurdity in style or  arrangement, and want of fitness to circumstances adopted for the  occasion.    We have stated that our prevailing rural architecture is discordant in  appearance; it may be added, that it is also uncouth, out of keeping  with correct rules, and, ofttimes offensive to the eye of any lover of  rural harmony. Why it is so, no matter, beyond the apology already  given--that of an absence of cultivation, and thought upon the subject.  It may be asked, of what consequence is it that the farmer or small  property-holder should conform to given rules, or mode, in the style and  arrangement of his dwelling, or out-buildings, so that they be  reasonably convenient, and answer his purposes? For the same reason that  he requires symmetry, excellence of form or style, in his horses, his  cattle, or other farm stock, household furniture, or personal dress.  It is an arrangement of artificial objects, in harmony with natural  objects; a cultivation of the sympathies which every rational being  should have, more or less, with true taste; that costs little or nothing  in the attainment, and, when attained, is a source of gratification  through life. Every human being is bound, under ordinary circumstances,  to leave the world somewhat better, so far as his own acts or exertions  are concerned, than he found it, in the exercise of such faculties as  have been given him. Such duty, among thinking men, is conceded, so far  as the moral world is concerned; and why not in the artificial? So far  as the influence for good goes, in all practical use, from the building  of a temple, to the knocking together of a pig-stye--a labor of years,  or the work of a day--the exercise of a correct taste is important, in a  degree.    In the available physical features of a country, no land upon earth  exceeds North America. From scenery the most sublime, through the  several gradations of magnificence and grandeur, down to the simply  picturesque and beautiful, in all variety and shade; in compass vast, or  in area limited, we have an endless variety, and, with a pouring out of  God's harmonies in the creation, without a parallel, inviting every  intelligent mind to study their features and character, in adapting them  to his own uses, and, in so doing, to even embellish--if such a thing be  possible--such exquisite objects with his own most ingenious handiwork.  Indeed, it is a profanation to do otherwise; and when so to improve them  requires no extraordinary application of skill, or any extravagant  outlay in expense, not to plan and to build in conformity with good  taste, is an absolute barbarism, inexcusable in a land like ours, and  among a population claiming the intelligence we do, or making but a  share of the general progress which we exhibit.    It is the idea of some, that a house or building which the farmer or  planter occupies, should, in shape, style, and character, be like some  of the stored-up commodities of his farm or plantation. We cannot  subscribe to this suggestion. We know of no good reason why the walls of  a farm house should appear like a hay rick, or its roof like the  thatched covering to his wheat stacks, because such are the shapes best  adapted to preserve his crops, any more than the grocer's habitation  should be made to imitate a tea chest, or the shipping merchant's a rum  puncheon, or cotton bale. We have an idea that the farmer, or the  planter, according to his means and requirements, should be as well  housed and accommodated, and in as agreeable style, too, as any other  class of community; not in like character, in all things, to be sure,  but in his own proper way and manner. Nor do we know why a farm house  should assume a peculiarly primitive or uncultivated style of  architecture, from other sensible houses. That it be a _farm_ house, is  sufficiently apparent from its locality upon the farm itself; that its  interior arrangement be for the convenience of the in-door farm work,  and the proper accommodation of the farmer's family, should be quite as  apparent; but, that it should assume an uncouth or clownish aspect, is  as unnecessary as that the farmer himself should be a boor in his  manners, or a dolt in his intellect.    The farm, in its proper cultivation, is the foundation of all human  prosperity, and from it is derived the main wealth of the community.  From the farm chiefly springs that energetic class of men, who replace  the enervated and physically decaying multitude continually thrown off  in the waste-weir of our great commercial and manufacturing cities and  towns, whose population, without the infusion--and that continually--of  the strong, substantial, and vigorous life blood of the country, would  soon dwindle into insignificance and decrepitude. Why then should not  this first, primitive, health-enjoying and life-sustaining class of our  people be equally accommodated in all that gives to social and  substantial life, its due development? It is absurd to deny them by  others, or that they deny themselves, the least of such advantages, or  that any mark of _caste_ be attempted to separate them from any other  class or profession of equal wealth, means, or necessity. It is quite as  well to say that the farmer should worship on the Sabbath in a  _meeting-house_, built after the fashion of his barn, or that his  district school house should look like a stable, as that his dwelling  should not exhibit all that cheerfulness and respectability in form and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/200"],[0,"The Project Gutenberg Encyclopedia, Volume 1 of 28 (#3)"],[1," castle of Habsburg, the old convent of Konigsfelden (with  fine painted medieval glass) and the remains of the Roman  settlement of Vindonissa [Windisch].  The total population  in 1900 was 206,498, almost exclusively German-speaking, but  numbering 114,176 Protestants to 91,039 Romanists and 990  Jews.  The capital of the canton is Aarau (q.v.), while  other important towns are Baden (q.v.), Zofingen (4591  inhabitants), Reinach (3668 inhabitants), Rheinfelden (3349  inhabitants), Wohlen (3274 inhabitants), and Lenzburg (2588  inhabitants).  Aargau is an industrious and prosperous canton,  straw-plaiting, tobacco-growing, silk-ribbon weaving, and  salmon-fishing in the Rhine being among the chief industries.  As this region was, up to 1415, the centre of the Habsburg  power, we find here many historical old castles (e.g.  Habsburg, Lenzburg, Wildegg), and former monasteries (e.g.  Wettingen, Muri), founded by that family, but suppressed in  1841, this act of violence being one of the main causes  of the civil war called the ``Sonderbund War,'' in 1847 in  Switzerland.  The cantonal constitution dates mainly from  1885, but since 1904 the election of the executive council  of five members is made by a direct vote of the people.  The  legislature consists of members elected in the proportion of  one to every 1100 inhabitants.  The ``obligatory referendum''  exists in the case of all laws, while 5000 citizens have the  right of ``initiative'' in proposing bills or alterations  in the cantonal constitution.  The canton sends 10 members  to the federal Nationalrat, being one for every 20,000,  while the two Standerate are (since 1904) elected by  a direct vote of the people.  The canton is divided into  eleven administrative districts, and contains 241 communes.      1415 the Aargau region was taken from the Habsburgs by the Swiss  Confederates.  Bern kept the south-west portion (Zofingen,  Aarburg, Aarau, Lenzburg, and Brugg), but some districts,  named the Freie Amter or ``free bailiwicks'' (Mellingen,  Muri, Villmergen, and Bremgarten), with the county of Baden,  were ruled as ``subject lands'' by all or certain of the  Confederates.  In 1798 the Bernese bit became the canton of  Aargau of the Helvetic Republic, the remainder forming the  canton of Baden.  In 1803, the two halves (plus the Frick  glen, ceded in 1802 by Austria to the Helvetic Republic)  were united under the name of Kanton Aargau, which was then  admitted a full member of the reconstituted Confederation.

AARHUS, a seaport and bishop's see of Denmark, on the  east coast of Jutland, of which it is the principal port;  the second largest town in the kingdom, and capital of  the amt (county) of Aarhus.  Pop. (1901) 51,814.  The  district is low-lying, fertile and well wooded.  The town  is the junction of railways from all parts of the country.  The harbour is good and safe, and agricultural produce is  exported, while coal and iron are among the chief imports.  The cathedral of the 13th century (extensively restored) is  the largest church in Denmark.  There is a museum of art and  antiquities.  To the south-west (13 m. by rail), a picturesque  region extends west from the railway junction of Skanderborg,  including several lakes, through which flows the Gudenaa,  the largest river in Jutland, and rising ground exceeding  500 ft. in the Himmelbjerg.  The railway traverses this  pleasant district of moorland and wood to Silkeborg, a modern  town having one of the most attractive situations in the  kingdom.  The bishopric of Aarhus dates at least from 951.    AARON, the traditional founder and head of the Jewish  priesthood, who, in company with Moses, led the Israelites  out of Egypt (see EXODUS; MOSES) . The greater part of  his life-history is preserved in late Biblical narratives,  which carry back existing conditions and beliefs to the  time of the Exodus, and find a precedent for contemporary  hierarchical institutions in the events of that period.  Although Aaron was said to have been sent by Yahweh (Jehovah)  to meet Moses at the ``mount of God'' (Horeb, Ex.iv.27),he  plays only a secondary part in the incidents at Pharaoh's  court.  After the ``exodus'' from Egypt a striking account  is given of the vision of the God of Israel vouchsafed to  him and to his sons Nadab and Abihu on the same holy mount  (Ex. xxiv. 1 seq. 9-11), and together with Hur he was at the  side of Moses when the latter, by means of his wonder-working  rod, enabled Joshua to defeat the Amalekites (xvii. 8-16).  Hur and Aaron were left in charge of the Israelites when  Moses and Joshua ascended the mount to receive the Tables of  the Law (xxiv. 12-15), and when the people, in dismay at the  prolonged absence of their leader, demanded a god, it was at  the instigation of Aaron that the golden calf was made (see  CALF, GOLDEN). This was regarded as an act of apostasy  which, according to one tradition, led to the consecration  of the Levites, and almost cost Aaron his life (cp. Deut.  ix. 20). The incident paves the way for the account of the  preparation of the new tables of stone which contain a series  of laws quite distinct from the Decalogue (q.v.) (Ex. xxxiii.  seq.).  Kadesh, and not Sinai or Horeb, appears to have been  originally the scene of these incidents (Deut. xxxiii. 8  seq. compared with Ex. xxxii. 26 sqq.), and it was for some  obscure offence at this place that both Aaron and Moses were  prohibited from entering the Promised Land (Num. xx.).  In  what way they had not ``sanctified'' (an allusion in the  Hebrew to Kadesh ``holy'') Yahweh is quite uncertain, and  it would appear that it was for a similar offence that the  sons of Aaron mentioned above also met their death (Lev. x. 3;  cp.  Num. xx. 12, Deut. xxxii. 51). Aaron is said to have  died at Moserah (Deut. x. 6), or at Mt. Hor; the latter is  an unidentified site on the border of Edom (Num. xx. 23,  xxxiii. 37; for Moserah see ib. 30-31), and consequently  not in the neighbourhood of Petra, which has been the  traditional scene from the time of Josephus (Ant. iv. 4. 7).    Several difficulties in the present Biblical text appear to  have arisen from the attempt of later tradition to find a  place for Aaron in certain incidents.  In the account of the  contention between Moses and his sister Miriam (Num. xii.),  Aaron occupies only a secondary position, and it is very doubtful  whether he was originally mentioned in the older surviving  narratives.  It is at least remarkable that he is only thrice  mentioned in Deuteronomy (ix. 20, x. 6, xxxii. 50). The  post-exilic narratives give him a greater share in the plagues of  Egypt, represent him as high-priest, and confirm his position  by the miraculous budding of his rod alone of all the rods of  the other tribes (Num. xvii.; for parallels see Gray comm.  ad loc., p. 217).  The latter story illustrates the growth  of the older exodus-tradition along with the development of  priestly ritual: the old account of Korah's revolt against the  authority of Moses has been expanded, and now describes (a)  the divine prerogatives of the Levites in general, and (b)  the confirmation of the superior privileges of the Aaronites  against the rest of the Levites, a development which can  scarcely be earlier than the time of Ezekiel (xliv. 15 seq.).    Aaron's son Eleazar was buried in an Ephraimite locality  known after the grandson as the ``hill of Phinehas'' (Josh.  xxiv. 33). Little historical information has been preserved of  either.  The name Phinehas (apparently of Egyptian origin)  is better known as that of a son of Eli, a member of the  priesthood of Shiloh, and Eleazar is only another form of  Eliezer the son of Moses, to whose kin Eli is said to have  belonged.  The close relation between Aaronite and Levitical  names and those of clans related to Moses is very noteworthy,  and it is a curious coincidence that the name of Aaron's  sister Miriam appears in a genealogy of Caleb (1 Chron. iv.  17) with Jether (cp. JETHRO) and Heber (cp. KENITES). In  view of the confusion of the traditions and the difficulty of  interpreting the details sketched above, the recovery of the  historical Aaron is a work of peculiar intricacy.  He may  well have been the traditional head of the priesthood, and  R. H. Kennett has argued in favour of the view that he was  the founder of the cult at Bethel (Journ. of Theol.  Stud.,  1905, pp. 161 sqq.), corresponding to the Mosaite founder  of Dan (q.v.). This throws no light upon the name, which  still remains quite obscure: and unless Aaron (Aharon) is  based upon Aron, ``ark'' (Redslob, R. P. A. Dozy, J. P.  N. Land), names associated with Moses and Aaron, which are,  apparently, of South Palestinian (or North-Arabian) origin.
