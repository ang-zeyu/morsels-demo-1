There may be a wide  difference in their aims, influenced by personal considerations, the  various differences of training and environment; but all are looking  forward to increased opportunities and a wider field of usefulness. The  experience of many young men will be found of value in shaping the  course of those who have not yet won their spurs. It is the purpose of  THE BROCHURE SERIES to furnish information as far as possible on  everything relating to the profession which will help to make the course  of such men an easy one. The articles upon the sketch clubs,  scholarships, and other educational work, have all been intended to  serve this purpose, and the cooperation of all who are working to this  end is earnestly solicited. Our pages will always be open for the  discussion of subjects of vital interest to young architects, and we  shall hope to see the opportunity largely taken advantage of.          American School of Architecture, Rome.      A recent circular issued by the committee of the American School of  Architecture at Rome contains a general description of the organization  of the school and its work. On the twelfth of last June, at a meeting  held in New York, it was decided to found such a school, and a committee  of control was selected including the chiefs of the schools of  architecture at the different American colleges where such exist. We  give below some quotations from this circular which will be found of  interest.    The school is founded for the benefit of advanced students only, and is  designed to further the more disciplinary work of other institutions by  opening to young men, already well trained by them in drawing and  design, certain special lines of study, which at present can be pursued  only under great disadvantages. Beginners, accordingly, will not be  received. Such work is not suitable to their condition, and it would be  a mistake to encourage them to devote their time to it. But to the  holders of traveling scholarships, to those who have acquitted  themselves with distinction in the competitions for these scholarships,  and to members of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts of at least three years'  standing, it offers opportunities for the completion of their  professional training which students thus equipped will, it is believed,  find of inestimable value. Other well-accredited students may be  admitted to certain hospitalities of the school, at the discretion of  the secretary.    Hitherto the holders of traveling scholarships have followed very  largely their own judgment as to their travel and study, and have  produced, as required, a certain number of carefully measured drawings,  which have borne testimony to the diligence of their authors, their  facility with pen, pencil, and brush, and the evident seriousness of  their intentions; but the work has necessarily shown no common purpose  and little consistent prosecution along carefully chosen lines. This  being their common experience, the past holders of traveling  scholarships are general in their approval of the effort to direct  foreign travel and study hereafter to more definite and specific  courses.    The school is one of observation and research rather than of design,  aiming to form a correct taste and to impress upon the mind, by daily  contact with great examples, those principles which are essential to the  enduring quality in architecture, be the style what it may. To this end  the founders of the school believe it to be of the utmost importance for  an architect, before he begins his professional career, to study  thoroughly and on the spot the monuments of ancient architecture and  such works of the Italian Renaissance as are worthy of being considered  their successors. The monuments best suited to this purpose are those of  Greece and Italy, and the headquarters of the school are established at  Rome rather than at Athens, because of the greater amount of material  there at hand of use to the modern student not only in the art of  architecture itself, but in that of mural painting and in the decorative  arts, including architectural sculpture.    The school was formally opened under the charge of Mr. Austin W. Lord,  as secretary, on the first of November last, in temporary quarters in  the upper story of the Palazzo Torlonia, on the southwest corner of the  Via dei Condotti and the Via Bocca di Leone, between the Corso and the  Piazza di Spagna; but a permanent home has now been secured in the  building known as the Casino dell'Aurora, occupying a part of the  grounds formerly belonging to the Villa Ludovisi. This building is  situated upon an isolated plot of ground, raised fifteen or twenty feet  above the surrounding streets, and comprising about eighty thousand  square feet, which is the size of the enclosed space in Gramercy Park in  the city of New York. It is on the Pincian Hill, not far from the French  Academy in the Villa Medici. The building contains about thirty rooms;  some of these are decorated with well-known frescoes, among which is the  Aurora of Guercino. The grounds, which were laid out by Lenotre, are  well covered with trees and shrubs, and afford ample space for the  erection of additional one story buildings, should such be required at  any time for workrooms or studios.          Personal.      Mr. A. L. Nicholson, formerly with Davis & Von Storch, architects,  Scranton, Pa., has accepted a position with De Lemos & Cordes, Fulton  Building, Fulton and Nassau Streets, New York.    Mr. Dwight H. Perkins, of the firm of Perkins & Selby, Marshall Field  Building, Chicago, opened a new office on May 1 at 1107 Steinway Hall  Building, Chicago.    Mr. Myron H. Hunt, recently returned from an extended trip abroad, has  gone into the office of Shepley, Rutan & Coolidge in Chicago.    Mr. F. N. Reed, who has distinguished himself in the Rotch Scholarship  competition, having been given second place each time in the last three  years, is now with Cabot, Everett & Mead of Boston.          Brochure Series Competition No. 1.      [Illustration]    Program: The Henry F. Miller Piano Company of Boston, with the idea of  turning the attention of designers to the problem of artistic piano  cases, has placed in the hands of publishers of THE BROCHURE SERIES $50,  to be awarded for sketches of piano cases. Three prizes of $25, $15, and  $10 will be given for the three best designs submitted, the judges to be  the officers, of the company, assisted by an architect who shall be  appointed by the publishers.    It is not the idea of the Henry F. Miller Piano Company to secure  designs for actual use, as their work in special case design is almost  entirely to order, carrying out designs for architects and decorators.  Therefore, only sketches are required which may be executed in any  medium the designer may choose, although due regard should be paid to  the reproductive character of the drawing. A perspective sketch, showing  the right end and front of the case, is required to be made on paper,  not exceeding 8x12 in. in size.    The diagram above gives the necessary dimensions. In designing the end  the only thing to be borne in mind is the construction of the case, the  front telescoping into the back or frame, as shown by the plan of the  end. The quarter round finish of the back is not necessary, the  treatment of the end being optional so long as dimensions and  construction are regarded.    The arm or end of the keyboard (_c_), the foot (_a_), the \"truss\" (_b_),  which supports the keyboard, are all left entirely to the designer, the  only dimensions to be regarded being the height of keyboard from the  floor (2 ft. 1 in.), the top of the keys (4-1/2 in. higher), and the  space (4 ft.) occupied by the keys. The arm projects 1 ft. 1 in. beyond  the front.    Drawings must be sent carriage paid so as to reach the editor of THE  BROCHURE SERIES on or before July 15, 1895.    The prize designs will become the property of the Henry F. Miller Piano  Company. The other designs will be returned to their authors. It is to  be understood, however, that any or all designs may be exhibited or  published, and that they may be retained a reasonable time after  judgment for these purposes.    The details and management of the competition are left entirely to the  publishers of THE BROCHURE SERIES, and it is hoped that this, the first  of a number of competitions they will endeavor to arrange, will bring  out the work of the best designers. If there is any portion of this  program not clearly understood, the publishers will explain more in  detail upon request."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19368"],[0,"The Mide'wiwin or \"Grand Medicine Society\" of the Ojibwa (#3)"],[1,"73, after referring to the Indian herbalist, mentions also the  ceremony of the \"calumet dance,\" as follows:      They have Physicians amongst them, towards whom they are very liberal    when they are sick, thinking that the Operation of the Remedies they    take, is proportional to the Presents they make unto those who have    prescrib'd them.    In connection with this, reference is made by Marquette to a certain  class of individuals among the Illinois and Dakota, who were compelled  to wear women's clothes, and who were debarred many privileges, but were  permitted to \"assist at all the Superstitions of their _Juglers_, and  their solemn Dances in honor of the _Calumet_, in which they may sing,  but it is not lawful for them to dance. They are call'd to their  Councils, and nothing is determin'd without their Advice; for, because  of their extraordinary way of Living, they are look'd upon as  _Manitous_, or at least for great and incomparable Genius's.\"    That the calumet was brought into requisition upon all occasions of  interest is learned from the following statement, in which the same  writer declares that it is \"the most mysterious thing in the World. The  Sceptres of our Kings are not so much respected; for the Savages have  such a Deference for this Pipe, that one may call it _The God of Peace  and War, and the Arbiter of Life and Death_. Their _Calumet of Peace_ is  different from the _Calumet of War_; They make use of the former to seal  their Alliances and Treaties, to travel with safety, and receive  Strangers; and the other is to proclaim War.\"    This reverence for the calumet is shown by the manner in which it is  used at dances, in the ceremony of smoking, etc., indicating a religious  devoutness approaching that recently observed among various Algonkian  tribes in connection with the ceremonies of the Mid[-e]/wiwin. When the  calumet dance was held, the Illinois appear to have resorted to the  houses in the winter and to the groves in the summer. The above-named  authority continues in this connection:      They chuse for that purpose a set Place among Trees, to shelter    themselves against the Heat of the Sun, and lay in the middle a large    Matt, as a Carpet, to lay upon the God of the Chief of the Company,    who gave the Ball; for every one has his peculiar God, whom they call    _Manitoa_. It is sometime a Stone, a Bird, a Serpent, or anything else    that they dream of in their Sleep; for they think this _Manitoa_ will    prosper their Wants, as Fishing, Hunting, and other Enterprizes. To    the Right of their _Manitoa_ they place the _Calumet_, their Great    Deity, making round about it a Kind of Trophy with their Arms, viz.    their Clubs, Axes, Bows, Quivers, and Arrows.  *  *  *  Every Body    sits down afterwards, round about, as they come, having first of all    saluted the _Manitoa_, which they do in blowing the Smoak of their    Tobacco upon it, which is as much as offering to it Frankincense.    *  *  *  This _Preludium_ being over, he who is to begin the Dance    appears in the middle of the Assembly, and having taken the _Calumet_,    presents it to the Sun, as if he wou'd invite him to smoke. Then he    moves it into an infinite Number of Postures sometimes laying it near    the Ground, then stretching its Wings, as if he wou'd make it fly, and    then presents it to the Spectators, who smoke with it one after    another, dancing all the while. This is the first Scene of this famous    Ball.    The infinite number of postures assumed in offering the pipe appear as  significant as the \"smoke ceremonies\" mentioned in connection with the  preparatory instruction of the candidate previous to his initiation into  the Mid[-e]/wiwin.    In his remarks on the religion of the Indians and the practices of the  sorcerers, Hennepin says:      As for their Opinion concerning the Earth, they make use of a Name of    a certain _Genius_, whom they call _Micaboche_, who has cover'd the    whole Earth with water (as they imagine) and relate innumerable    fabulous Tales, some of which have a kind of Analogy with the    Universal Deluge. These Barbarians believe that there are certain    Spirits in the Air, between Heaven and Earth, who have a power to    foretell future Events, and others who play the part of Physicians,    curing all sorts of Distempers. Upon which account, it happens, that    these _Savages_ are very Superstitious, and consult their Oracles with    a great deal of exactness. One of these Masters-Jugglers who pass for    Sorcerers among them, one day caus'd a Hut to be erected with ten    thick Stakes, which he fix'd very deep in the Ground, and then made a    horrible noise to Consult the Spirits, to know whether abundance of    Snow wou'd fall ere long, that they might have good game in the    Hunting of Elks and Beavers: Afterward he bawl'd out aloud from the    bottom of the Hut, that he saw many Herds of Elks, which were as yet    at a very great distance, but that they drew near within seven or    eight Leagues of their Huts, which caus'd a great deal of joy among    those poor deluded Wretches.    That this statement refers to one or more tribes of the Algonkian  linguistic stock is evident, not only because of the reference to the  sorcerers and their peculiar methods of procedure, but also that the  name of _Micaboche_, an Algonkian divinity, appears. This Spirit, who  acted as an intercessor between Ki/tshi Man/id[-o] (Great Spirit) and  the Indians, is known among the Ojibwa as Mi/nab[-o]/zho; but to this  full reference will be made further on in connection with the Myth of  the origin of the Mid[-e]/wiwin. The tradition of Nokomis (the earth)  and the birth of Manabush (the Mi/nab[-o]/zho of the Menomoni) and his  brother, the Wolf, that pertaining to the re-creation of the world, and  fragments of other myths, are thrown together and in a mangled form  presented by Hennepin in the following words:      Some Salvages which live at the upper end of the River St. _Lawrence_,    do relate a pretty diverting Story. They hold almost the same opinion    with the former [the Iroquois], that a Woman came down from Heaven,    and remained for some while fluttering in the Air, not finding Ground    whereupon to put her Foot. But that the Fishes moved with Compassion    for her, immediately held a Consultation to deliberate which of them    should receive her. The Tortoise very officiously offered its Back on    the Surface of the Water. The Woman came to rest upon it, and fixed    herself there. Afterwards the Filthiness and Dirt of the Sea gathering    together about the Tortoise, there was formed by little and little    that vast Tract of Land, which we now call _America_.      They add that this Woman grew weary of her Solitude, wanting some body    for to keep her Company, that so she might spend her time more    pleasantly. Melancholy and Sadness having seiz'd upon her Spirits, she    fell asleep, and a Spirit descended from above, and finding her in    that Condition approach'd and knew her unperceptibly. From which    Approach she conceived two Children, which came forth out of one of    her Ribs. But these two Brothers could never afterwards agree    together. One of them was a better Huntsman than the other; they    quarreled every day; and their Disputes grew so high at last, that one    could not bear with the other. One especially being of a very wild    Temper, hated mortally his Brother who was of a milder Constitution,    who being no longer able to endure the Pranks of the other, he    resolved at last to part from him. He retired then into Heaven,    whence, for a Mark of his just Resentment, he causeth at several times    his Thunder to rore over the Head of his unfortunate Brother.      Sometime after the Spirit descended again on that Woman, and she    conceived a Daughter, from whom (as the Salvages say) were propagated    these numerous People, which do occupy now one of the greatest parts    of the Universe.    It is evident that the narrator has sufficiently distorted the  traditions to make them conform, as much as practicable, to the biblical  story of the birth of Christ. No reference whatever is made in the  Ojibwa or Menomoni myths to the conception of the Daughter of Nokomis  (the earth) by a celestial visitant, but the reference is to one of the  wind gods. Mi/nab[-o]/zho became angered with the Ki/tshi Man/id[-o],  and the latter, to appease his discontent, gave to Mi/nab[-o]/zho the  rite of the Mid[-e]wiwin. The brother of Mi/nab[-o]/zho was destroyed by  the malevolent underground spirits and now rules the abode of  shadows,--the \"Land of the Midnight Sun.\"    Upon his arrival at the \"Bay of Puans\" (Green Bay, Wisconsin), Marquette  found a village inhabited by three nations, viz: \"Miamis, Maskoutens,  and Kikabeux.\" He says:      When I arriv'd there, I was very glad to see a great Cross set up in    the middle of the Village, adorn'd with several White Skins, Red    Girdles, Bows and Arrows, which that good People had offer'd to the    Great _Manitou_, to return him their Thanks for the care he had taken    of them during the Winter, and that he had granted them a prosperous    Hunting. _Manitou_, is the Name they give in general to all Spirits    whom they think to be above the Nature of Man.    Marquette was without doubt ignorant of the fact that the cross is the  sacred post, and the symbol of the fourth degree of the Mid[-e]/wiwin,  as will be fully explained in connection with that grade of the society.  The erroneous conclusion that the cross was erected as an evidence of  the adoption of Christianity, and possibly as a compliment to the  visitor, was a natural one on the part of the priest, but this same  symbol of the Mid[-e]/ Society had probably been erected and bedecked  with barbaric emblems and weapons months before anything was known of  him.
