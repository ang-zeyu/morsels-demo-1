It is very remarkable how  Nature helps the wild creatures to disguise themselves by colouring them  with various shades and tints best calculated to enable them to escape  enemies or to entrap prey.    The animals of each locality are usually coloured according to their  habitat, but good reasons make some exceptions advisable. Many of the  most striking examples of this protective resemblance among animals are  the result of their very intimate association with the surrounding flora  and natural scenery. There is no part of a tree, including flowers,  fruits, bark and roots, that is not in some way copied and imitated by  these clever creatures. Often this imitation is astonishing in its  faithfulness of detail. Bunches of cocoanuts are portrayed by sleeping  monkeys, while even the leaves are copied by certain tree-toads, and  many flowers are represented by monkeys and lizards. The winding roots  of huge trees are copied by snakes that twist themselves together at the  foot of the tree.    In the art of camouflage--an art which affects the form, colour, and  attitude of animals--Nature has worked along two different roads. One is  easy and direct, the other circuitous and difficult. The easy way is  that of protective resemblance pure and simple, where the animal's  colour, form, or attitude becomes like that of its habitat. In which  case the animal becomes one with its environment and thus is enabled to  go about unnoticed by its enemies or by its prey. The other way is that  of bluff, and it includes all inoffensive animals which are capable of  assuming attitudes and colours that terrify and frighten. The colours in  some cases are really of warning pattern, yet they cannot be considered  mimetic unless they are thought to resemble the patterns of some extinct  model of which we know nothing; and since they are not found in  present-day animals with unpleasant qualities, they are not, strictly  speaking, warning colours.    Desert animals are in most cases desert-coloured. The lion, for example,  is almost invisible when crouched among the rocks and streams of the  African wastes. Antelopes are tinted like the landscape over which they  roam, while the camel seems actually to blend with the desert sands. The  kangaroos of Australia at a little distance seem to disappear into the  soil of their respective localities, while the cat of the Pampas  accurately reflects his surroundings in his fur.    The tiger is made so invisible by his wonderful colour that, when he  crouches in the bright sunlight amid the tall brown grass, it is almost  impossible to see him. But the zebra and the giraffe are the kings of  all camouflagers! So deceptive are the large blotch-spots of the giraffe  and his weird head and horns, like scrubby limbs, that his concealment  is perfect. Even the cleverest natives often mistake a herd of giraffes  for a clump of trees. The camouflage of zebras is equally deceptive.  Drummond says that he once found himself in a forest, looking at what he  thought to be a lone zebra, when to his astonishment he suddenly  realised that he was facing an entire herd which were invisible until  they became frightened and moved. Evidently the zebra is well aware that  the black-and-white stripes of his coat take away the sense of solid  body, and that the two colours blend into a light gray, and thus at  close range the effect is that of rays of sunlight passing through  bushes.    The arctic animals, with few exceptions, are remarkable for imitating  their surroundings; their colour of white blends perfectly with the snow  around them. The polar bear is the only white bear, and his home is  always among the snow and ice. The arctic fox, alpine hare, and ermine  change to white in winter only, because during the other seasons white  would be too conspicuous. The American arctic hare is always white  because he always lives among the white expanses of the Far North. Both  foxes and stoats are carnivorous and feed upon ptarmigan and hares, and  they must be protectively coloured that they may catch their prey. On  the other hand, Nature aids the prey by providing them with colours that  enable them to escape the attention of their enemies.    The young of many of the arctic animals are covered with fluffy white  hair, so that while they are too young to swim they may lie with safety  upon the ground and escape the attention of polar bears; but in the  antarctic regions, where there are few enemies to fear, the young seals,  for instance, are exactly the colour of their parents.    The most remarkable exception of mimetic colouring among the animals of  the polar regions is the sable. Throughout the long Siberian winter he  retains his coat of rich brown fur. His habits, however, are such that  he does not need the protection of colour, for he is so active that he  can easily catch wild birds, and he can also subsist upon wild berries.  The woodchuck of North America retains his coat of dark-brown fur  throughout the long, cold winters. The matter of his obtaining food,  however, is easy, for he lives in burrows, near streams where he can  catch fish and small animals that live in or near the water.    A number of the old-school naturalists believed that when an animal's  colouring assumed the snowy-white coat of its arctic surroundings, this  was due to the natural tendency on the part of its hair and fur to  assume the colourings and tints of their habitat. This, however, is  absolutely false; and no better proof of it can be offered than the case  of the arctic musk-ox, who is far more polar in his haunts than even the  polar bear, and is therefore exposed to the whitening influence of the  wintry regions more than the bear. Yet he never turns white, but is  always brown. The only enemy of this northern-dweller is the arctic  wolf, and against this enemy he is protected by powerful hoofs, thick  hair, and immense horns. He does not need to conceal himself, and  therefore does not simulate the colour of his surroundings.    [Illustration: _American Museum of Natural History, New York_    THE INDIANS CLAIM THAT THE MOTHER BISON FORCED HER CALF TO ROLL OFTEN IN  A PUDDLE OF RED CLAY, SO THAT IT MIGHT BE INDISTINGUISHABLE AGAINST ITS  RED CLAY BACKGROUND.]    [Illustration: _American Museum of Natural History, New York_    THE ZEBRA IS ONE OF THE CLEVEREST OF CAMOUFLAGERS. THE BLACK-AND-WHITE  STRIPES OF HIS BODY GIVE THE EFFECT OF SUNLIGHT PASSING THROUGH BUSHES.]    Mimetic resemblances are worked out with great difficulty, except in  such cases as the nocturnal animals, which simply become one with their  surroundings. Mice, rats, moles, and bats wear overcoats that are very  inconspicuous, and when suddenly approached they appear almost  invisible. Some of the North American Indians claimed that buffaloes  made their calves wallow in the red clay to prevent them from being seen  when they were lying down in the red soil.    The kinds of protection from these mimetic resemblances are many and  varied: the lion, because of his sandy-colouring, is able to conceal  himself by merely crouching down upon the desert sands; the striped  tiger hides among the tufts of grass and bamboos of the tropics, the  stripes of his body so blending with the vertical stems as to prevent  even the natives from seeing him in this position. The kudu, one of the  handsomest of the antelopes, is a remarkable animal in several ways. His  camouflage is so perfect that it gives him magnificent courage. With his  spiral horns, white face, and striped coat tinted in pale blue, he is  almost invisible when hiding in a thicket. The perfect harmony of his  horns with the twisted vines and branches, and the white colourings with  blue tints in the reflected sunlight conceal him entirely.    The snow-leopard, which inhabits Central Asia, is stony-grey, with large  annular spots to match the rocks among which he lives. This colouration  conceals him from the sheep, upon which he preys; while the spotted and  blotchy pattern of the so-called clouded tiger, and the  peculiarly-barred skin of the ocelot, imitate the rugged bark of trees,  upon which these animals live.    One of the most unusual and skilled mimics is the Indian sloth, whose  colour pattern and unique eclipsing effects seem almost incredible to  those unfamiliar with the real facts. His home is in the trees, and he  has a deep, orange-coloured spot on his back, which would make him very  conspicuous if seen out of his home surroundings. But he is very clever,  and clings to the moss-draped trees, where the effect of the  orange-coloured spot is exactly like the scar on the tree, while his  hair resembles the withered moss so strikingly that even naturalists are  deceived.    Henry Drummond must have known the animal world rather well when he  remarked that \"Carlisle in his blackest visions of 'shams and humbugs'  among humanity never saw anything so finished in hypocrisy as the  naturalist now finds in every tropical forest. There are to be seen  creatures, not singly, but in tens of thousands, whose every appearance,  down to the minutest spot and wrinkle, is an affront to truth, whose  every attitude is a pose for a purpose, and whose whole life is a  sustained lie. Before these masterpieces of deception the most ingenious  of human impositions are vulgar and transparent. Fraud is not only the  great rule of life in a tropical forest, but the one condition of it.\"    Many of the larger cats live in trees, and most of them have spotted or  oscillated skins, which aid them in hiding among foliage plants. The  puma who wears a brown coat is an exception, but it must be remembered  that he does not need the kind of coat his fellow friends wear. He  clings so closely to the body of a tree while waiting for his prey as to  be almost invisible.    This phenomenon is true throughout the animal world.

Permit me to present to  your majesty the lovely, gentle, blushing lady Louisa Mortimer, lately  arrived in your majesty's kingdom; your majesty will perceive that she  bears loyalty in her--hey! what! excited!--hysterics!\"    The last exclamations were elicited by a violent effort of Louis to  extricate himself.    \"Frank, leave him alone!\"    \"What is the will of royalty?\" said Frank, struggling with his  refractory cousin.    \"That you leave Louis Mortimer alone,\" said Hamilton. \"You will like us  better presently, Louis,\" added he, shaking hands with him: \"my subjects  appear to consider themselves privileged to be rude to a new-comer; but  my royal example will have its weight in due time.\"    \"Your majesty's faithful trumpeter, grand vizier, and factotum is alive  and hearty,\" said Frank.    \"But as he had a selfish fit upon him just now,\" returned Hamilton,  \"we were under the necessity of doing our own business.\"    \"I crave your majesty's pardon,\" said Frank, stroking his sovereign  tenderly on the shoulder; for which affectionate demonstration he was  rewarded by a violent push that laid him prostrate.    \"I am a martyr to my own benevolence,\" said Frank, getting up and  approaching Louis, \"still I am unchanged in devotion to your ladyship.  Tell me what I can do,\"--and whichever way Louis turned, Frank with  his smirking face presented himself;--\"Will you not give your poor  slave one command?\"    \"Only that you will stand out of my sunshine,\" said Louis good-temperedly.    \"Very good,\" exclaimed Hamilton.    \"Out of your sunshine! What, behind you? that is cruel, but most  obsequiously I obey.\"    Louis underwent the ordeal of a new scholar's introduction with  unruffled temper, though his cousin took care there should be little  cessation until afternoon school, when Louis was liberated from his  tormentors to his great satisfaction--Frank's business carrying him  to a part of the school-room away from that where Louis was desired to  await further orders. In the course of the afternoon, he was summoned  to the presence of Dr. Wilkinson, who was holding a magisterial levee  in one of two class-rooms or studies adjoining the school-room. The  doctor appeared in one of his sternest humors. Besides the fourteen  members of the first class, whose names Louis knew already, there  was in this room a boy about Louis' age, who seemed in some little  trepidation. Doctor Wilkinson closed the book he held, and laying it  down, dismissed his pupils; then turning to the frightened-looking boy,  he took a new book off the table, saying, \"Do you know this, Harrison?\"    \"Yes, sir,\" faintly replied the boy.    \"Where did you get it?\"    \"I bought it.\"    \"To assist you in winning prizes from your more honorable class-fellows,  I suppose,\" said the doctor, with the most marked contempt. \"Since you  find Kenrick too difficult for you, you may go into the third class,  where there may be, perhaps, something better suited to your capacity;  and beware a second offence: you may go, sir.\"    Louis felt great pity for the boy, who turned whiter still, and then  flushed up, as if ready to burst into tears.    \"Well, Louis, I wish to see what rank you will be able to take,\"  said the doctor, and he proceeded with his examination.    \"Humph!\" he ejaculated at length, \"pretty well--you may try in the  second class. I can tell you that you must put your shoulder to  the wheel, and make the most of your powers, or you will soon be  obliged to leave it for a less honorable post; but let me see what  you can do--and now put these books away on that shelf.\" As he spoke,  the doctor pointed to a vacant place on one of the shelves that lined  two sides of the study, and left the room. Louis put the books away,  and then returned to the school-room, where he sought his brother, and  communicated his news just before the general uproar attendant on the  close of afternoon school commenced.    Reginald was one of the most noisy and eager in his preparations for  play; and, dragging Louis along with him, bounded into the fresh air,  with that keen feeling of enjoyment which the steady industrious  school-boy knows by experience.    \"What a nice play-ground this is!\" said Louis.    \"Capital!\" said Reginald. \"What's the fun, Frank?\" he cried to his  cousin, who bounded past him at this moment, towards a spot already  tolerably crowded.    \"Maister Dunn,\" shouted Frank.    \"Oh, the old cake-man, Louis,\" said Reginald; \"I must go and get rid  of a few surplus pence.\"    \"Do you like to spend your money in cakes?\" asked Louis; \"I have plenty,  Mrs. Colthrop took care of that.\"    \"In that case I'll save for next time,\" said Reginald, \"but let's go  and see what's going on.\"    Accordingly Reginald ran off in the cake-man's direction. Louis followed,  and presently found himself standing in the outer circle of a group of  his school-fellows, who formed a thick wall round a white-haired old  man and a boy, both of whom carried a basket on each arm, filled with  dainties always acceptable to a school-boy's palate.    [Illustration: Maister Dunn.]    Were I inclined to moralize, I might here make a few remarks on waste of  money, &c., but my business being merely to relate incidents at present,  I shall only say that there they stood, the old man and his assistant,  with the boys in constant motion and murmur around them.    Frank Digby and Hamilton were in the outer circle, the latter having  _walked_ from a direction opposite to that from which Frank and Reginald  came, but whose dignity did not prevent a certain desire to purchase if  he saw fit, and if not, to amuse himself with those who did so. He stood  watching the old man with an imperturbable air of gravity, and, hanging  on his arm in a state of listless apathy, stood Trevannion, another  member of the first class.    Frank Digby took too active a share in most things in the establishment  to remain a passive spectator of the actions of others, and began pushing  right and left. \"Get along, get away ye vagabonds!\" he politely cried:  \"you little shrimps! what business have you to stop the way?--Alfred, you  ignoramus! Alfred, why don't you move?\"    \"Because I'm buying something,\" said the little boy addressed, looking  up very quietly at the imperious intruder.    \"_Da locum melioribus_, Alfred, as the poet has it. Do you know where  to find that, my boy?--the first line of the thirteenth book of the  Aeneid, being a speech of the son of Anchises to the Queen of Carthage.  You'll find a copy of Virgil's works in my desk.\"    \"I don't mean to look,\" said Alfred, \"I know it's in the Delectus.\"    \"Wonderful memory!--I admire that delectable book of yours,\" cried Frank,  who talked on without stopping, while forcing himself to the first rank.  \"How now, Maister Dunn!\" he said, addressing the old man, \"I hope you  b'aint a going to treat us as e did last time. You must be reasonable;  the money market is in a sadly unflourishing condition at present.\"    \"You always talk of the _money market_, Frank,\" said little Alfred:  \"what do you mean by the money market?\"    \"It's a place, my dear--I'll explain it in a moment. Here, Maister  Dunn;--It's a place where the old women sell sovereigns a penny  a measure, Alfred.\"    \"Oh, Frank!\" exclaimed Alfred.    \"Oh! and why not?\" said Frank; \"do you mean to say you don't believe me?  That's it,--isn't it, maister?\"    \"Ah, Maister Digby! ye're at yer jokes,\" said the old man.    \"Jokes!\" said Frank, with a serious air. \"Pray, Mr. Dunn, did you ever  happen to notice certain brass, or copper, or bronze tables, four in  number, in front of the Bristol Exchange!\"    \"Ay sure, maister!\"    \"Well, I'll insense you into the meaning of that, presently. That, my  good sir, is where the old women stood in the good old times, crying  out, 'Here you are! sovereigns a penny a measure!' And that's the reason  people used to be so rich!\"    \"Oh, Frank! now I know that's only your nonsense,\" said Alfred.    \"Well, I can't give you a comprehension, and if I could buy you one, I  couldn't afford it,\" answered Frank. \"Now here's my place for any one;  Louis, I'll make you a present of it, as I don't want it.\"    \"I don't want to buy any thing,\" said Louis.    \"Rubbish!\" cried Frank. \"Every one does. Don't be stingy.\" And so  Louis allowed himself to be pushed and pulled into the crowd, and  bought something he would much rather have been without, because  he found it inconvenient to say _no_.    The two upper classes were privileged to use the largest of the  class-rooms as their sitting-room in the evenings; and here Reginald  introduced his brother after tea; and, when he had shown him his  lessons, began to prepare his own. Most of the assembled youths were  soon quietly busy, though some of the more idly disposed kept up a fire  of words, while turning over leaves, and cutting pens to pieces. Among  the latter class was Frank Digby, who was seldom known to be silent  for a quarter of an hour, and who possessed the singular power of  distracting every one's attention but his own; for, though he scarcely  ever appeared to give his lessons a moment's attention, he was generally  sufficiently prepared with them to enable him to keep his place in his  class, which was usually two from the bottom.    Louis saw that he must give his whole mind to his work; but being  unused to study in a noise, it was some time before he was well able  to comprehend what he wanted to do; and found himself continually  looking up and laughing at something around him, or replying to some  of Frank's jokes, which were often directed to him. When, by a great  exertion, he had at last forced himself to attend to Reginald's repeated "]]]
