Really, the two girls' dispositions were  much alike, but Beatrice's early position of responsibility had turned  into strength of character what was at present mere manifestation of  independence and often bravado in Gwen.    Winnie, a sweet-tempered, pretty girl of eighteen, had just been made  an under-mistress at \"Rodenhurst\", Miss Roscoe's school, which she and  Gwen and Lesbia attended daily. Teaching was not at all Winnie's  vocation, she hated it heartily, but as her services cancelled her  sisters' school fees, she was obliged to accept the unwelcome drudgery  for the sake of the help it gave to her father's narrow income. If it  was Beatrice's ambition to go out into the world and carve a career  for herself, it was certainly Winnie's ideal to stop at home. She was  a born housekeeper, and loved sewing and cake-baking and jam-making,  and dusting the best china, and gardening, and rearing poultry and  ducks. It seemed a great pity that she could not have changed places  with her elder sister, but Beatrice's education had been stopped too  soon for her to be of any use as a teacher, while Winnie, though not  clever, had been carefully trained in Rodenhurst methods. Fortunately  she had a very cheerful, sunny disposition, that was prone to make the  best of things, so she struggled along, taking Miss Roscoe's many  suggestions and reproofs so amiably that the Principal, often irate  at her lack of capacity, had not the heart to scold her too severely.  Of her own choice, I am afraid, Winnie would never have opened a book,  but she managed to get up her subjects for her classes, and was a  conscientious, painstaking mistress, if not a brilliant one.    After Gwen came the beauty of the family, twelve-year-old Lesbia, a  dear, delightful, smiling, lovable little lazybones, usually at the  bottom of her Form. Lesbia never attempted to work hard at school. She  scraped through her lessons somehow, generally with Gwen's help at home,  and took life in a happy-go-lucky fashion, with as little trouble to  herself as possible. Lesbia's chief virtue was an admirably calm and  unruffled temper: she would laugh philosophically over things that made  Gwen rage, and though she had not half the character of the latter, she  was a far greater general favourite. She was much petted at school, both  by her own Form and by the Seniors, for she had sweet, coaxing little  ways, and a helpless, confiding look in her blue eyes that was rather  fascinating, and her lovely fair flaxen hair gave her the appearance of  a large wax doll, just new from a toy shop. Lesbia had one great  advantage: she was always well dressed. She possessed a rich cousin of  exactly her own age, whose clothes were passed on to her. Irene grew  rapidly, so her handsome frocks and coats were scarcely worn when they  reached Lesbia, and as Aunt Violet invariably sent them first to the  cleaners, they would arrive wrapped in folds of dainty tissue paper, and  looking like new. It seemed rather hard that Lesbia should always be the  lucky recipient of the parcels, and Beatrice, with a strict sense of  justice, had often tried to adapt some of the things for Gwen. It was  quite impossible, however--Lesbia's neat, dainty little figure exactly  fitted into the clothes, while Gwen, tall and big-boned even for her  extra two and a half years, was so many sizes too large that she had to  resign all hope of \"fineries\", and content herself with plain blouses  and navy-blue serge skirts that could be lengthened easily. Not that  Gwen troubled much about dress at this period of her existence; indeed  she was apt to throw on her garments in a haphazard fashion that greatly  excited Beatrice's wrath, and would raise a remonstrance even from  Winnie. Life was so full of different things, and so many fresh  interests and new plans were crowding continually into her brain, that  she never had time to think whether her tie was neatly knotted or her  belt properly fastened; it is a sad admission to make, no doubt, but  then Gwen was no ideal heroine, only a very faulty, impetuous,  headstrong, human girl.    Three little brothers completed the Gascoyne family--Giles, Basil, and  Martin, aged respectively ten, nine, and five, bonny mischievous  urchins, who were alternately Beatrice's pride and despair. By vigorous  measures she managed to keep them in tolerably good order, but she could  never be sure what pranks they would play next, and was generally  prepared for emergencies. She always had supplies handy of arnica,  sticking plaster, and rags for cut fingers, and would toil away  patiently mending long rents in small knickerbockers or darning holes in  stockings and jerseys. Giles and Basil went daily to a branch  establishment of Rodenhurst, kept by Miss Roscoe for boys under twelve;  and Martin learnt his letters at home, and trotted about the house and  parish in Beatrice's wake. He was a sweet little scamp, and the apple of  her eye, for she had brought him up from babyhood, but she sometimes  felt it would be an intense relief when he was old enough to go to  school with the others.    For seven years the Gascoynes had lived at the little parsonage at  Skelwick Bay. It was a small, low, creeper-covered place, built behind  a sheltering spur of hill, to protect it from the fierce winter gales  and the driving spray of the sea. Four latticed bedroom windows caught  the early morning sun, and a stone porch shielded the front door,  which opened directly into the sitting-room. There was nothing at all  grand about the house, but, thanks to Beatrice, it was neatly kept,  and had an air of general comfort. All articles likely to be broken by  small fingers were wisely put away, or placed in father's study, a  sanctum where no one might intrude without express permission; but  books, paint boxes, &c., were freely allowed, and each member of the  family had a special shelf on which to keep his or her particular  possessions. Beatrice had many excellent rules, and though in the  enforcement of these she was strict to the verge of severity, in the  main she was just, and had her father's full sanction for her  authority.    The garden at the Parsonage was a great joy, with its thick hedge of  fuchsias, and its beds of fragrant wallflowers, and its standard roses  growing among the grass, and its clumps of Czar violets under the  sheltered wall. Here Winnie toiled early and late, getting up  sometimes with the sun that she might put in an hour's work before  breakfast, weeding, replanting, pruning, raking, and tying up. It was  chiefly owing to her exertions that the show of flowers was so good,  though Gwen was her ally in that respect, and even Lesbia gave a  little desultory help. There was a thick, bowery lime tree under whose  shade it was delightful to have tea in summer, or to lie reading books  on hot Sundays; and there was a fascinating corner of the old wall,  which the girls called \"the rampart\", from whence it was possible to  command an excellent view of the main road--a great convenience  sometimes to the younger ones, who would keep watch, and beat a hasty  retreat if they saw an unwelcome visitor arriving, leaving Beatrice to  offer hospitality alone.    Gwen was the worst sinner in this respect. She was bashful, and hated  to have to say \"How do you do?\" to callers. In spite of Beatrice's  efforts to train her in social ways, she would fly at the very  approach of a flower-trimmed hat or a white parasol.    \"You scuttle off like a rabbit into its burrow,\" said Beatrice  indignantly on one occasion; \"and if you're caught, you behave in such  a silly, awkward way that I'm ashamed of you. People will think you  haven't been properly brought up, and blame me. It's not my fault that  you've got no manners.\"    \"I feel as if I don't know where to look when people speak to me, and  as if my hands and feet were too big,\" protested Gwen. \"I can't help  shuffling and wrinkling up my forehead--I can't indeed! You're  awfully hard on me, Bee!\"    \"Perhaps she'll grow a little more accustomed to her hands and feet  when she's older,\" suggested Winnie, the peacemaker.    \"They're useful for catching chickens at present, and that ought to be  enough for you, Win,\" laughed Gwen. \"You'd have lost those white  Leghorns if I hadn't rescued them.\"    Winnie was considered chief \"henwife\" at the Parsonage. She could not  give as much time to the poultry as she wished, and had to delegate  many of her duties to Beatrice, or Nellie, the maid, but nevertheless  held herself responsible for the welfare of her feathered flock. On  Saturdays she delighted to array herself in an overall pinafore and  carry out improvements in the hen-yard. Armed with hammer, nails, and  pieces of wire netting, she would turn old packing-cases into chicken  coops and nesting boxes, or make neat contrivances for separating  various fussy matrons with rival broods of chicks. Winnie was really  wonderfully handy and clever, and albeit her carpentry was naturally  of a rather rough-and-ready description, it served the purpose for  which she designed it, and saved calling in the services of the  village joiner, an economy which her father much appreciated. Winnie  was determined to run her poultry systematically. She kept strict  accounts, balancing the bills for corn and meal against current market  prices for eggs and chickens, and being tremendously proud if her book  showed a profit. On the whole she did well, for the fowls had a free  run on the common at the back of the house, and could thus pick up  much for themselves. With the help of the poultry, and a good  vegetable garden, Beatrice was able to make her small housekeeping  allowance supply the needs of the family, but there were no luxuries  at the Parsonage. The girls possessed few or none of the pretty  trifles dear to their sex, their"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21688"],[0,"Scottish Cathedrals and Abbeys (#3)"],[1,"of the Anglo-Normans, whom the  presence and policy of Margaret, saint and queen, attracted to Scotland.  It developed itself, always with some national characteristics of its  own, until the War of Independence broke off all friendly intercourse  with England.    Later came, in place of alliance with England, the alliance with France,  which lasted till the Reformation, and left its mark on many of the  pages of \"The Great Stone Book,\" which chronicle for us the vicissitudes  of the past, the days of peace and prosperity, of war and penury, of  reviving national health and energy, of new combinations and ideas in  politics and statecraft, of spiritual decay and carnal pride and  ostentation. These annals can be deciphered by the patient student of  the walls and cloisters of the ancient churches and religious houses.    To the founders and the owners of the latter, and chiefly to the great  orders of the Augustinians, the Benedictines, and the Cistercians, we  owe many of our noblest remnants of the past--all of them unhappily  ruined; for the popular violence of the sixteenth century raged more  fiercely against the monasteries than against the cathedrals. To the  Episcopal system of government, introduced under Margaret, we owe the  bishops' churches or cathedrals.    The life and thought of the Church at the present day, move far enough  apart from either prelacy or monasticism to allow us to look at each  with an impartial eye, and to consider whether in its abolition we have  parted with aught that it would have profited the Church to retain.    The monasteries, at first the homes and shelters of charity and  learning, had, before the sixteenth century, waxed fat with unduly  accumulated wealth, become enervated with luxury and corrupt through bad  government. They were swept away, their possessions secularised, and  their communities broken up. But with them disappeared two things which  were of great price: a large and liberal provision for the poor, and a  comprehensive scheme of Education. The monastery gate was never shut  against the suffering and the needy. The monks were indulgent landlords  and kind neighbours; the sick benefited by their medical skill; the  indigent could always look to them for eleemosynary aid; the houseless  wanderer was never sent empty away. Those great centres of friendly  helpfulness and charity were planted all over the land. No doubt the  gift of indiscriminate alms to every applicant would tend to abuse and  lazy beggary; but a scheme of sympathetic and well directed aid  thoughtfully administered would not. _Abusus non tollit usum._ The  scandals of the monasteries did not justify the robbery of the destitute  for the benefit of the secular supplanters of the monks. The  Kirk-sessions of the Reformed Kirk did their best to take the place of  the former guardians and kindly benefactors of the poor, but their funds  were scanty; the old wealth had fallen into tenacious hands; and schism  and sectarianism finally necessitated the transfer of the care of the  poor from the Church to the State.    Could the ancient system have been reformed and not destroyed, the  poverty of the country would have been less grievous than it is to-day;  the Church's relation to the poor more intimate; and the method of  relief pleasanter to the recipients than that which makes them familiar  with the grim charity of the Poor's House, the Inspector, and the  Parochial Board.    The monasteries were the seats of a general system of higher education.  The burghs had their own independent seminaries; the \"song schools\" were  more closely connected with the churches in town and in country; but the  highest grade of education was found in the monasteries. Before the  foundation of any of the universities they supplied the place both of  secondary school and university, and trained the youth, especially of  the higher ranks, until prepared to go out into the world, as they  constantly did, speaking the \"lingua-franca\" of all scholars, and  carrying Scottish energy, genius, and scholarship into the halls and  cloisters of many a college and many a monastery, from Coimbra to  Cracow, from Salerno to Upsala. These schools all perished with the  downfall of the monasteries; and consequently we cannot, to this day,  cope with the great public schools of England, or adequately supply the  blank in our educational system created by their spoliation and  abolition. Here, too, wise reform might have spared and remodelled what  misguided zeal, allied with unprincipled greed, destroyed.    With the ruination and impoverishment of the cathedrals, an element in  the Church's life inseparable from them, and most salutary and useful,  ceased to be. The bishops' deprivation of an authority they had too  often disgraced and misused, vested the government of the Church in the  presbyterate; and the national sentiment approved of the change. But  there was no necessity for upsetting the whole cathedral system, and  rooting out the whole cathedral staff, because the bishop was turned  adrift. Had the Canonries been spared, an immense boon would have been  secured for the Reformed Church. Had the stipends attached to them not  been alienated, the Church would have possessed, at all its most  important centres, a staff of clergymen chosen for their ability and  worth, for their learning and power of government and organisation,  aiding the minister in his work, or enriching the theological literature  of their time. With them might have been associated younger men, either  under their supervision as candidates for the ministry, or as  probationers acquiring practical knowledge of its duties and  requirements. The cathedral would have stood out, in its city, great or  small, as the Mother Church--holding forth the model of devout ritual,  of earnest and learned teaching, of zealous work. How vastly superior  its influence would have been, spiritually, intellectually, socially, to  that of struggling _quoad sacra_ churches, with their ill-paid clergy,  or \"missions\" in charge of worse-paid probationers, it is, I think,  needless to point out. But the possibility of such an institution passed  away when the cathedrals were desecrated, and their revenues were  \"grippit\"--to use Knox's phrase--by the ungodly robbers of the Church.    I have written these few pages to serve as an introduction to what  follows, from the hand of my friend, Mr. Butler. The Committee of the  Guild asked me to prepare a volume on the most notable of our ancient  churches; and finding that other engagements stood in the way of my  doing so, I recommended that the work should be entrusted to Mr. Butler,  of whose ability to do it well I felt confident. Having read what he has  written, I find my confidence was not misplaced, and that his treatment  of the subject is most instructive, thorough, and exact. It will add to  the reputation he has already gained by his history of his own parish of  Abernethy on Tay, and his books on Wesley in Scotland, and on Henry  Scougal; and will prove an invaluable guide to all students of our  historic churches, cathedral, collegiate, and monastic.    R. H. S.          SCOTTISH CATHEDRALS AND ABBEYS          CHAPTER I    RELATION OF CELTIC CHURCH TO ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH      The period begun by the influence of Queen Margaret (1047-1093),  continued by her sons and their successors on the Scottish throne, and  culminating in the Scottish Reformation of 1560, is that with which this  book deals.    The old Celtic Church of Scotland was brought to an end by two  causes--internal decay and external change. Under the first head, notice  must be taken of the encroachment upon the ecclesiastic element by the  secular, and of the gradual absorption of the former by the latter.  There was a vitality in the old ecclesiastical organisation, but it was  weakened by the assimilation of the native Church to that of Rome in the  seventh and eighth centuries, which introduced a secular element among  the clergy; and the frequent Danish invasions, which may be described as  the organised power of Paganism against Scottish Christianity,  grievously undermined its native force. The Celtic churches and  monasteries were repeatedly laid waste or destroyed, and the native  clergy were compelled either to fly or take up arms in defence; the  lands, unprotected by the strong arm of law, fell into the hands of  laymen, who made them hereditary in their families, and ultimately  nothing was left but the name of abbacy, applied to the lands, and that  of abbot, borne by a secular lord. Under the second head--external  change--may be noted the policy adopted towards the Celtic Church by the  kings of the race of Queen Margaret. It consisted (1) in placing the  Church upon a territorial in place of a tribal basis, in substituting  the parochial system and a diocesan episcopacy for the old tribal  churches with monastic jurisdiction and functional episcopacy; (2) in  introducing the orders of the Church of Rome, and founding great  monasteries as counter influences to the Celtic Church; (3) in absorbing  the Culdees or Columban clergy into the Roman system, by first  converting them from secular into regular canons, and afterwards by  merging them in the latter order.[1] King David especially founded  bishoprics and established cathedrals, equipped with the ordinary  cathedral staff of deans, canons, and other functionaries, and  monasteries equipped with representatives of the monastic orders. Thus  the native Celtic Church, undermined by internal decay, was extinguished  by external change and a course of aggression which rolled from St.  Andrews until it reached the far-off shores of Iona. All that remained  to speak of its vitality and beneficence to the people of Scotland  consisted of the roofless walls of an early church, or an old churchyard  with its Celtic cross; the names of the early pastors by whom the  churches were"]]]
