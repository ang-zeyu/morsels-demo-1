I ain't educated up to see it.\"    Mis' Jane Moran, who had changed her chair three times to avoid a  draught, sat down carefully in her fourth chair, her face twitching a  little as if its muscles were connected with her joints.    \"Christmas won't be no different from any other day to our house this  year,\" she said. \"We'll get up and eat our three meals and sit down and  look at each other. We can't even spare a hen--she might lay if we  didn't eat her.\"    Mis' Abby Winslow, mother of seven under fifteen, looked up from her  rocking-chair--Mis' Winslow always sat limp in chairs as if they were  reaching out to rest her and, indeed, this occasional yielding to the  force of gravity was almost her only luxury.    \"You ain't thinking of the children, Mis' Bates,\" she said, \"nor you  either, Jane Moran, or you couldn't talk that way. We can't have no real  Christmas, of course. But I'd planned some little things made out of  what I had in the house: things that wouldn't be anything, and yet would  seem a little something.\"    Mis' Mortimer Bates swept round at her.    \"Children,\" she said, \"ought to be showed how to do without things.  Bennet and Gussie ain't expecting a sliver of nothing for Christmas--not  a sliver.\"    Mis' Winslow unexpectedly flared up.    \"Whether it shows through on the outside or not,\" she said, \"I'll bet  you they are.\"    \"My three,\" Mis' Emerson Morse put in pacifically, \"have been kept from  popping corn and cracking nuts all Fall so's they could do both  Christmas night, and it would seem like something that _was_ something.\"    \"That ain't the idea,\" Mis' Bates insisted; \"I want them learnt to do  without--\" (\"They'll learn that,\" Mis' Abby Winslow said; \"they'll  learn....\") \"Happening as it does to most every one of us not to have no  Christmas, they won't be no distinctions drawn. None of the children can  brag--and children is limbs of Satan for bragging,\" she added. (She was  remembering a brief conversation overheard that day between Gussie and  Pep, the minister's son:--    \"I've got a doll,\" said Gussie.    \"I've got a dollar,\" said Pep.    \"My mamma went to a tea party,\" said Gussie.    \"My mamma give one,\" said Pep.    Gussie mustered her forces. \"My papa goes to work every morning,\" she  topped it.    \"My papa don't have to,\" said Pep, and closed the incident.)    \"I can't help who's a limb of Satan,\" Mis' Winslow replied doggedly, \"I  can't seem to sense Christmas time without Christmas.\"    \"It won't _be_ Christmas time if you don't have any Christmas,\" Mis'  Bates persisted.    \"Oh, yes it will,\" Mis' Winslow said. \"Oh, yes, it will. You can't stop  that.\"    It was Mis' Bates, who, from the high-backed plush rocker, rapped with  the blue glass paperweight on the red glass lamp and, in the absence of  Mr. Bates, called the meeting to order. The Old Trail Town Society was  organized on a platform of \"membership unlimited, dues nothing but  taking turns with the entertaining, officers to consist of: President,  the host of the evening (or wife, if any), and no minutes to bother  with.\" And it was to a meeting so disposed on the subject of Christmas  that Simeon Buck rose to present his argument.    \"Mr. President,\" he addressed the chair.    \"It's Madam President, you ninny geese,\" corrected Buff Miles, _sotto  voce_.    \"It had ought to be Madam Chairman,\" objected Mis' Moran; \"she ain't the  continuous president.\"    \"Well, for the land sakes, call me Mis' Bates, formal, and go ahead,\"  said the lady under discussion. \"Only I bet you've forgot now what you  was going to say.\"    \"Not much I did _not_,\" Simeon Buck continued composedly, and, ignoring  the interruptions, let his own vocative stand. Then he presented a  memorandum of a sum of money. It was not a large sum. But when he quoted  it, everybody looked at everybody else, stricken. For it was a sum large  enough to have required, in the earning, months of work on the part of  an appalling proportion of Old Trail Town.    \"From the day after Thanksgiving to the night before Christmas last  year,\" said Simeon, \"that is the amount that the three hundred  souls--no, I guess it must have been bodies--in our town spent in the  local stores. Now, bare living expenses aside,--which ain't very much  for us all, these days,--this amount may be assumed to have been spent  by the lot of us for Christmas. Of course there was those,\" continued  Mr. Buck, looking intelligently about him, \"who bought most of their  Christmas stuff in the City. But these--these economic traitors only  make the point of what I say the more so. Without them, the town spent  this truly amazing sum in keeping the holidays. Now, I ask you, frank,  could the town afford that, or anything like that?\"    Buff Miles spoke out of the extremity of his reflections.    \"That's a funny crack,\" he said, \"for a merchant to make. Why not leave  'em spend and leave 'em pay?\"    \"Oh, I'll leave 'em _pay_ all right,\" rejoined Simeon, significantly,  and stood silent and smiling until there were those in the room who  uncomfortably shifted.    Then he told them the word he bore from Ebenezer Rule that as they had  feared and half expected, the factory was not to open that Winter at  all. Hardly a family represented in the rooms was not also  representative of a factory employee, now idle these seven months, as  they were periodically idle at the times of \"enforced\" suspension of the  work.    \"What I'm getting at is this,\" Simeon summed it up, \"and Abel Ames,  here, backs me up--don't you, Abel?--that hadn't we all ought to come to  some joint conclusion about our Christmas this year, and roust the town  up to it, like a town, and not go it blind and either get in up to our  necks in debt, same as City folks, or else quit off Christmas,  individual, and mebbe hurt folks's feelings? Why not move intelligent,  like a town, and all agree out-and-out to leave Christmas go by this  year? And have it understood, thorough?\"    It was very still in the little rooms when he had finished. There seems  to be no established etiquette of revolutions. But something of the  unconsciousness of the enthusiast was upon Mis' Mortimer Bates, and she  spoke before she knew:--    \"So's we can be sure everybody else'll know it and not give something  either and be disappointed too,\" she assented. \"Well, I bet everybody'd  be real relieved.\"    \"The churches has sanctioned us doing away with Christmas this year by  doing away with it themselves,\" observed Mis' Jane Moran. \"That'd ought  to be enough to go by.\"    \"It don't seem to me Christmas is a thing for the churches to decide  about,\" said Simeon, thoughtfully. \"It seems to me the matter is up to  the merchants and the grocers and the family providers. We're the ones  most concerned. Us providers have got to scratch gravel to get together  any Christmas at all, if any. And speaking for us merchants, I may say,  we'll lay in the stock if folks'll buy it. But if they can't afford to  pay for it, we don't want the stock personally.\"    \"I guess we've all had the experience,\" observed Mis' Jane Moran, \"of  announcing we wasn't going to give any gifts _this_ year, and then had  somebody send something embroidered by hand, with a solid month's work  on it. But if we all agree to secede from Christmas, we can lay down the  law to folks so's it'll be understood: _No Christmas for nobody_.\"    \"Not to children?\" said Mis' Abby Winslow, doubtfully.    \"My idea is to teach 'em to do entirely without Christmas,\" harped Mis'  Bates. \"We can't afford one. Why not let the children share in the  family privation without trying to fool 'em with make-shift presents and  boiled sugar?\"    Over in a corner near the window plants, whose dead leaves she had been  picking off, sat Ellen Bourne--Mis' Matthew Bourne she was, but nearly  everybody called her Ellen Bourne. There is some law about these things:  why instinctively we call some folk by the whole name, some by their  first names, some by the last, some by shortening the name, some by a  name not their own. Perhaps there is a name for each of us, if only we  knew where to look, and folk intuitively select the one most like that.  Perhaps some of us, by the sort of miracle that is growing every day,  got the name that is meant for us. Perhaps some of us struggle along  with consonants that spell somebody else. And how did some names get  themselves so terrifically overused unless by some strange might, say, a  kind of astrological irregularity.... Ellen Bourne sat by the window and  suddenly looked over her shoulder at the room.    \"If we've got the things made,\" she said, \"can't we give 'em? If it's to  children?\"    \"I think if we're going to omit, we'd ought to omit,\" Mis Bates held her  own; \"it can't matter to you, Ellen, with no children, so....\" She  caught herself sharply up. Ellen's little boy had died a Christmas or  two ago.    \"No,\" Ellen said, \"I ain't any children, of course. But--\"    \"Well, I think,\" said Mis' Jane Moran, \"that we've hit on the only way  we could have hit on to chirk each other up over a hard time.\"    \"And get off delicate ourselves same time,\" said Buff Miles. From the  first Buff had been advocating what he called \"an open Christmas,\" and  there were those near him at the meeting to whom he had confided some  plan about \"church choir Christmas carol serenades,\" which he was loath  to see set at naught.    Not much afterward Simeon Buck put the motion:--    \"Mis' Chairman,\" he said, \"I move you--and all of us--that the Old Trail  Town meeting do and hereby does declare itself in favour of striking  Christmas celebrations from its calendar this year. And that we  circulate a petition through the town to this effect, headed by our  names. And that we all own up that it's for the simple and regretful  reason that not a mother's son of us can afford to buy Christmas  presents this year, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20521"],[0,"The New York Times Current History, A Monthly Magazine (#3)"],[1," degree that all  the innovations and all the reforms which have been decided upon and  actually begun are threatened to remain without effect.    The Sublime Porte feels convinced that the only way toward salvation  for the Ottoman Government lies in the realization of the necessary  reforms in the least possible time. In the same way the Porte feels  that every encouragement will be shown her in the decisive steps to be  undertaken for this end.    Convinced of this, the Imperial Government has decided to abolish, on  Oct. 1, 1914, the capitulations, and all conventions, concessions, and  privileges emanating therefrom, which have become an iron ring around  the State, making it impossible for it to progress.    At the same time the Ottoman Government engages to treat with foreign  countries in accordance with the rules of international law. While I  have the honor of communicating to your Excellency this decision,  which opens a new and happy era in the life of the Ottoman Empire, an  event which undoubtedly will please your Excellency, I consider it my  duty to add that the Porte in abolishing the capitulations does not  harbor any hostile feeling against any of the foreign States, but is  acting solely in the highest interests of the empire. At the same  time, the Porte is ready to begin pourparlers for the conclusion of  commercial treaties in accordance with the principles of international  law.    _The Turkish press made little mention of the manner in which Europe  took notice of the important step taken by the Porte, and the  Ministerial Tasfiri Efkiar was the only one to express the feelings of  the Government on this occasion, saying:_    It is not proper for us to expect a unanimous and speedy satisfaction  from all the European powers; but, on the other hand, we must welcome  every objection and every discussion from whatever source it comes, as  in this way we shall know who are our friends and who our enemies.      APPROACHING THE CRISIS.    _The events covering the period from Sept. 10, when the abolition of  the capitulations was decided upon, till Oct. 29, when the Turkish  fleet attacked Russian ports and shipping in the Black Sea, were  confined mostly to hasty and all-absorbing warlike preparations on the  part of the Turkish Government, assisted by the German military  mission. The Constantinople correspondent of The Daily Atlantis of New  York wrote on Sept. 17:_    We are daily approaching a crisis. The Government has not swerved from  its warlike attitude, and is threatening not only Greece, but Russia  and the Triple Entente as well, while, on the other hand, it has  failed to secure Rumanian or Bulgarian co-operation in its militant  policy. At the same time, the Porte has learned that efforts are being  made in the Balkans for common action against Turkey. It also became  known that the Governments of London and Petrograd agreed to indemnify  Bulgaria by giving her Adrianople and Thrace, while Greece was to have  Smyrna, with a considerable hinterland.    During this period the Turkish press maintained an active campaign  against England and the Allies. The following extract from an  editorial article published in the Terdjumani-Hakkikat thus  characterizes the situation:         Everybody knows that the Balkan States are traversing a       period of doubts, and that the belligerent parties are doing       their best in order to secure the sympathies and the       assistance of the Balkan States.         To begin with, the idea of reconstructing the Balkan League       came under consideration. In this way the Balkan States       think they will become strong enough to impose their will at       the final settlement that will follow the war. This idea,       however, based as it is on the nullification of the Treaty       of Bucharest, and on certain sacrifices on the part of       Rumania and Greece, proved to be a failure. In the course of       the discussion between the two States it was shown that       neither Greece nor Rumania was willing to make any sacrifice       in favor of Bulgaria. The Balkan Alliance, being thus       unpracticable, the belligerent powers of Europe attempted to       attract Rumania and Bulgaria only, and to this end they made       every sort of promise to the two Governments of Sofia and       Bucharest. The President of the London Balkan Committee, Mr.       Noel Buxton, went to Bulgaria and made certain promises to       Mr. Radoslavoff, the Bulgarian Premier, in the name of Sir       Edward Grey. He promised the restitution to Bulgaria of the       Enos-Midia line, including Adrianople. The Bulgarians,       however, are not to be fooled in this way by promises at the       expense of third parties, and especially when the eventual       cost of these gifts might be a heavy one. We must not forget       that Bulgaria wants not Thrace, but Macedonia. If Great       Britain had promised Bulgaria Macedonia, including Saloniki,       and the Bulgarian Government was convinced beforehand of the       fulfillment of the promise, then it is certain that the       proposal would be accepted. But this is not in line with       England's interests, because in that case she would lose her       two other customers--Greece and Servia. And so there goes       Mr. Buxton making offers out of our own pocket.         But we Turks have been used to injustices; and it has become       an axiom in history that whenever there is trouble in any       part of the world we must be the ultimate sufferers. It       seems that this time, too, \"our friends\" felt like repeating       the same story; but now we are not to be caught napping, and       the Government, having in time mobilized the army, is ready       for every emergency.    _On Sept. 27 a Turkish destroyer having been stopped by a British  destroyer outside the Dardanelles, the Turkish Government ordered the  straits closed to all shipping._    _The Turkish Government tried to justify in the official press of  Constantinople the measure of closing the straits by declaring that  this important step was undertaken only after a Franco-British fleet  had established an actual blockade of the straits to the detriment of  Turkish commerce and neutral navigation. The Government organ, The  Tasfiri-Efkiar, said:_    The powers are trying to justify the mobilization of Switzerland, and  are making a great case of Belgian neutrality, but meantime they  consider our mobilization as having no other purpose than an  aggression against our neighbors.    Now, if the neutrality of Switzerland, which is guaranteed by all the  powers, is likely to be endangered, how is it possible for us to  remain calm and undisturbed in this universal upheaval, so long as we  know that to annoy and continually harass Turkey according to the  fancies of Europe has well-nigh become a sort of fashion?    Those powers that are dissatisfied at our mobilization are eager to  find our anxiety as without foundation for the mere reason that our  territorial integrity remains under the guarantee of all the powers.  But where was that guarantee when Tripoli and Cyrenaica were attacked  in a way little differing from open brigandage? And was it not the  same powers who forgot their guaranties in the Balkan Peninsula when  they abolished the famous status quo? With such facts before us is it  not ridiculous to speak of European guaranties? While we have now  before us what happened to Belgium, why should our mobilization excite  such widespread indignation? All we are trying to do is to safeguard  and protect our interests and protect ourselves from aggression on the  part of the Balkan States.      WAR DECLARED.    _On Oct. 29, 1914, the attack of the Turkish forces upon Russia and  England was delivered. Following is the official Turkish version of  the events leading to the rupture of diplomatic relations between  Turkey and the Triple Entente, contained in the first Turkish  communique of the war, appearing in the Turkish press on Oct. 31,  1914:_    While on the 27th of October a small part of the Turkish fleet was  manoeuvring in the Black Sea, the Russian fleet, which at first  confined its activities to following and hindering every one of our  movements, finally, on the 29th, unexpectedly began hostilities by  attacking the Ottoman fleet.    During the naval battle which ensued the Turkish fleet, with the help  of the Almighty, sank the mine-layer Pruth, displacing 5,000 tons and  having a cargo of 700 mines; inflicted severe damage on one of the  Russian torpedo boats, and captured a collier.    A torpedo from the Turkish torpedo boat Gairet-i-Millet sank the  Russian destroyer Koubanietz, and another from the Turkish torpedo  boat Mouavenet-i-Millet inflicted serious damage on a Russian  coastguard ship.    Three officers and seventy-two sailors, rescued by our men and  belonging to the crews of the damaged and sunken vessels of the  Russian fleet, have been made prisoners. The Ottoman imperial fleet,  glory be given to the Almighty, escaped injury, and the battle is  progressing favorably for us.    The Imperial Government will no doubt protest most energetically  against this hostile action of the Russian fleet against a small part  of our fleet.    Information received from our fleet now in the Black Sea is as  follows: From accounts of Russian sailors taken prisoners and from the  presence of a mine-layer among the Russian fleet, evidence is gathered  that the Russian fleet intended closing the entrance to the Bosphorus  with mines and destroying entirely the imperial Ottoman fleet after  having split it in two. Our fleet, believing that it had to face an  unexpected attack, and supposing that the Russians had begun  hostilities without a formal declaration of war, pursued the scattered  Russian fleet, bombarded the port of Sebastopol, destroyed in the city  of Novorosiysk fifty petroleum depots, fourteen military transports,  some"]]]
