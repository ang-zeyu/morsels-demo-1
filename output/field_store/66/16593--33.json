The purpose of this assembly is love and  unity.    The divine Prophets came to establish the unity of the Kingdom in human  hearts. All of them proclaimed the glad tidings of the divine bestowals to  the world of mankind. All brought the same message of divine love to the  world. Jesus Christ gave His life upon the cross for the unity of mankind.  Those who believed in Him likewise sacrificed life, honor, possessions,  family, everything, that this human world might be released from the hell  of discord, enmity and strife. His foundation was the oneness of humanity.  Only a few were attracted to Him. They were not the kings and rulers of  His time. They were not rich and important people. Some of them were  catchers of fish. Most of them were ignorant men, not trained in the  knowledge of this world. One of the greatest of them, Peter, could not  remember the days of the week. All of them were men of the least  consequence in the eyes of the world. But their hearts were pure and  attracted by the fires of the Divine Spirit manifested in Christ. With  this small army Christ conquered the world of the East and the West. Kings  and nations rose against Him. Philosophers and the greatest men of  learning assailed and blasphemed His Cause. All were defeated and  overcome, their tongues silenced, their lamps extinguished, their hatred  quenched; no trace of them now remains. They have become as nonexistent,  while His Kingdom is triumphant and eternal.    The brilliant star of His Cause has ascended to the zenith, while night  has enveloped and eclipsed His enemies. His name, beloved and adored by a  few disciples, now commands the reverence of kings and nations of the  world. His power is eternal; His sovereignty will continue forever, while  those who opposed Him are sleeping in the dust, their very names unknown,  forgotten. The little army of disciples has become a mighty cohort of  millions. The Heavenly Host, the Supreme Concourse are His legions; the  Word of God is His sword; the power of God is His victory.    Jesus Christ knew this would come to pass and was content to suffer. His  abasement was His glorification; His crown of thorns, a heavenly diadem.  When they pressed it upon His blessed head and spat in His beautiful face,  they laid the foundation of His everlasting Kingdom. He still reigns,  while they and their names have become lost and unknown. He is eternal and  glorious; they are nonexistent. They sought to destroy Him, but they  destroyed themselves and increased the intensity of His flame by the winds  of their opposition.    Through His death and teachings we have entered into His Kingdom. His  essential teaching was the unity of mankind and the attainment of supreme  human virtues through love. He came to establish the Kingdom of peace and  everlasting life. Can you find in His words any justification for discord  and enmity? The purpose of His life and the glory of His death were to set  mankind free from the sins of strife, war and bloodshed. The great nations  of the world boast that their laws and civilization are based upon the  religion of Christ. Why then do they make war upon each other? The Kingdom  of Christ cannot be upheld by destroying and disobeying it. The banners of  His armies cannot lead the forces of Satan. Consider the sad picture of  Italy carrying war into Tripoli. If you should announce that Italy was a  barbarous nation and not Christian, this would be vehemently denied. But  would Christ sanction what they are doing in Tripoli? Is this destruction  of human life obedience to His laws and teachings? Where does He command  it? Where does He consent to it? He was killed by His enemies; He did not  kill. He even loved and prayed for those who hung Him on the cross.  Therefore, these wars and cruelties, this bloodshed and sorrow are  Antichrist, not Christ. These are the forces of death and Satan, not the  hosts of the Supreme Concourse of heaven.    No less bitter is the conflict between sects and denominations. Christ was  a divine Center of unity and love. Whenever discord prevails instead of  unity, wherever hatred and antagonism take the place of love and spiritual  fellowship, Antichrist reigns instead of Christ. Who is right in these  controversies and hatreds between the sects? Did Christ command them to  love or to hate each other? He loved even His enemies and prayed in the  hour of His crucifixion for those who killed Him. Therefore, to be a  Christian is not merely to bear the name of Christ and say, \"I belong to a  Christian government.\" To be a real Christian is to be a servant in His  Cause and Kingdom, to go forth under His banner of peace and love toward  all mankind, to be self-sacrificing and obedient, to become quickened by  the breaths of the Holy Spirit, to be mirrors reflecting the radiance of  the divinity of Christ, to be fruitful trees in the garden of His  planting, to refresh the world by the water of life of His teachings--in  all things to be like Him and filled with the spirit of His love.    Praise be to God! The light of unity and love is shining in these faces.  These spiritual susceptibilities are the real fruits of heaven. The Bab  and Baha'u'llah over sixty years ago proclaimed the glad tidings of  universal peace. The Bab was martyred in the Cause of God. Baha'u'llah  suffered forty years as a prisoner and exile in order that the Kingdom of  love might be established in the East and West. He has made it possible  for us to meet here in love and unity. Because He suffered imprisonment,  we are free to proclaim the oneness of the world of humanity for which He  stood so long and faithfully. He was chained in dungeons, He was without  food, His companions were thieves and criminals, He was subjected to every  kind of abuse and infliction, but throughout it all He never ceased to  proclaim the reality of the Word of God and the oneness of humanity. We  have been brought together here by the power of His Word--you from America,  I from Persia--all in love and unity of spirit. Was this possible in former  centuries? If it is possible now after fifty years of sacrifice and  teaching, what shall we expect in the wonderful centuries coming?    Therefore, let your faces be more radiant with hope and heavenly  determination to serve the Cause of God, to spread the pure fragrances of  the divine rose garden of unity, to awaken spiritual susceptibilities in  the hearts of mankind, to kindle anew the spirit of humanity with divine  fires and to reflect the glory of heaven to this gloomy world of  materialism. When you possess these divine susceptibilities, you will be  able to awaken and develop them in others. We cannot give of our wealth to  the poor unless we possess it. How can the poor give to the poor? How can  the soul that is deprived of the heavenly bounties develop in other souls  capacity to receive those bounties?    Array yourselves in the perfection of divine virtues. I hope you may be  quickened and vivified by the breaths of the Holy Spirit. Then shall ye  indeed become the angels of heaven whom Christ promised would appear in  this Day to gather the harvest of divine planting. This is my hope. This  is my prayer for you.          12 April 1912  Talk at Studio of Miss Phillips  39 West Sixty-seventh Street, New York      Notes by John G. Grundy    I give you greeting in love and unity. The affairs of this world are to be  accounted as nothing compared to the joy and heavenly happiness of meeting  the friends of God. It is to experience this great joy and blessing that I  have come here although weary from my long voyage upon the sea. Tonight I  am in the greatest happiness, looking upon this concourse of God. Your  meeting here is surely an evidence that you are upholding the Cause of  God, that you are aiding and assisting in establishing the Kingdom of God.  Therefore, the culmination of my happiness is to look upon your faces and  realize that you have been brought together by the power of the Blessed  Perfection, Baha'u'llah. In this meeting you are upholding His standard  and assisting His Cause. Therefore, I behold in you the making of a goodly  tree upon which divine fruits will appear to give sustenance to the world  of humanity.    With hearts set aglow by the fire of the love of God and spirits refreshed  by the food of the heavenly spirit you must go forth as the disciples  nineteen hundred years ago, quickening the hearts of men by the call of  glad tidings, the light of God in your faces, severed from everything save  God. Therefore, order your lives in accordance with the first principle of  the divine teaching, which is love. Service to humanity is service to God.  Let the love and light of the Kingdom radiate through you until all who  look upon you shall be illumined by its reflection. Be as stars, brilliant  and sparkling in the loftiness of their heavenly station. Do you  appreciate the Day in which you live?    This is the century of the Blessed Perfection!    This is the cycle of the light of His beauty!    This is the consummate day of all the Prophets!    These are the days of seed sowing. These are the days of tree planting.  The bountiful bestowals of God are successive. He who sows a seed in this  day will behold his reward in the fruits and harvest of the heavenly  Kingdom. This timely seed, when planted in the hearts of the beloved of  God, will be watered by showers of divine mercy and warmed by the sunshine  of divine love. Its fruitage and flower shall be the solidarity of  mankind, the perfection of justice and the praiseworthy attributes of  heaven manifest in humanity. All who sow such a seed and plant such a tree  according to the teachings of Baha'u'llah shall surely witness this divine  outcome in the degrees of its perfection and will attain unto the good  pleasure of the Merciful One.    Today the nations of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19287"],[0,"Selections from the Writings of `Abdu'l-Bahá (#3)"],[1,"way, the light of  divine guidance will shine forth, and the blessings of God will cradle all  mankind: for love is light, no matter in what abode it dwelleth; and hate  is darkness, no matter where it may make its nest. O friends of God! That  the hidden Mystery may stand revealed, and the secret essence of all  things may be disclosed, strive ye to banish that darkness for ever and  ever.            2: O MY LORD! I HAVE DRAWN NIGH UNTO THEE, IN THE ...      O my Lord! I have drawn nigh unto Thee, in the depths of this darksome  night, confiding in Thee with the tongue of my heart, trembling with joy  at the sweet scents that blow from Thy realm, the All-Glorious, calling  unto Thee, saying:    O my Lord, no words do I find to glorify Thee; no way do I see for the  bird of my mind to soar upward to Thy Kingdom of Holiness; for Thou, in  Thy very essence, art sanctified above those tributes, and in Thy very  being art beyond the reach of those praises which are offered Thee by the  people that Thou hast created. In the sanctity of Thine own being hast  Thou ever been exalted above the understanding of the learned among the  Company on high, and forever wilt Thou remain enwrapped within the  holiness of Thine own reality, unreached by the knowledge of those  dwellers in Thine exalted Kingdom who glorify Thy Name.    O God, my God! How can I glorify or describe Thee inaccessible as Thou  art; immeasurably high and sanctified art Thou above every description and  praise.    O God, my God! Have mercy then upon my helpless state, my poverty, my  misery, my abasement! Give me to drink from the generous cup of Thy grace  and forgiveness, stir me with the sweet scents of Thy love, gladden my  bosom with the light of Thy knowledge, purify my soul with the mysteries  of Thy oneness, raise me to life with the gentle breeze that cometh from  the gardens of Thy mercy--till I sever myself from all else but Thee, and  lay hold of the hem of Thy garment of grandeur, and consign to oblivion  all that is not Thee, and be companioned by the sweet breathings that waft  during these Thy days, and attain unto faithfulness at Thy Threshold of  Holiness, and arise to serve Thy Cause, and to be humble before Thy loved  ones, and, in the presence of Thy favoured ones, to be nothingness itself.    Verily art Thou the Helper, the Sustainer, the Exalted, the Most Generous.    O God, my God! I beg of Thee by the dawning of the light of Thy Beauty  that hath illumined all the earth, and by the glance of Thy divine  compassion's eye that considereth all things, and by the surging sea of  Thy bestowals in which all things are immersed, and by Thy streaming  clouds of bounty raining down gifts upon the essences of all created  things, and by the splendours of Thy mercy that existed before ever the  world was--to help Thy chosen ones to be faithful, and assist Thy loved  ones to serve at Thine exalted Threshold, and cause them to gain the  victory through the battalions of Thy might that overpowereth all things,  and reinforce them with a great fighting host from out of the Concourse on  high.    O my Lord! They are weak souls standing at Thy door; they are paupers in  Thy courtyard, desperate for Thy grace, in dire need of Thy succour,  turning their faces toward the kingdom of Thy oneness, yearning for the  bounties of Thy bestowals. O my Lord! Flood Thou their minds with Thy holy  light; cleanse Thou their hearts with the grace of Thine assistance;  gladden their bosoms with the fragrance of the joys that waft from Thy  Company above; make bright their eyes by beholding the signs and tokens of  Thy might; cause them to be the ensigns of purity, the banners of sanctity  waving high above all creatures on the summits of the earth; make Thou  their words to move hearts which are even as solid rock. May they arise to  serve Thee and dedicate themselves to the Kingdom of Thy divinity, and set  their faces toward the realm of Thy Self-Subsistence, and spread far and  wide Thy signs, and be illumined by Thy streaming lights, and unfold Thy  hidden mysteries. May they guide Thy servants unto gentle waters and to  the fountain of Thy mercy that welleth and leapeth in the midmost heart of  the Heaven of Thy oneness. May they hoist the sail of detachment upon the  Ark of Salvation, and move over the seas of Thy knowledge; may they spread  wide the pinions of unity and by their aid soar upward to the Kingdom of  Thy singleness to become servants whom the Supreme Concourse will applaud,  whose praises the dwellers in Thine all-glorious realm will utter; may  they hear the heralds of the invisible world as they raise their cry of  the Most Great Glad-Tidings; may they, in their longing to meet Thee,  invoke and pray unto Thee, intoning wondrous orisons at the dawn of  light--O my Lord Who disposest all things--shedding their tears at  morningtide and even, yearning to pass into the shadow of Thy mercy that  endeth never.    Help them, O my Lord, under all conditions, support them at all times with  Thine angels of holiness, they who are Thine invisible hosts, Thy heavenly  battalions who bring down to defeat the massed armies of this nether  world.    Verily art Thou the Mighty, the Powerful, the Strong, the  All-Encompassing, the One Who hath dominion over all that is.    O holy Lord! O Lord of loving-kindness! We stray about Thy dwelling,  longing to behold Thy beauty, and loving all Thy ways. We are hapless,  lowly, and of small account. We are paupers: show us mercy, give us  bounty; look not upon our failings, hide Thou our endless sins. Whatever  we are, still are we Thine, and what we speak and hear is praise of Thee,  and it is Thy face we seek, Thy path we follow. Thou art the Lord of  loving-kindness, we are sinners and astray and far from home. Wherefore, O  Cloud of Mercy, grant us some drops of rain. O Flowering Bed of grace,  send forth a fragrant breeze. O Sea of all bestowals, roll towards us a  great wave. O Sun of Bounty, send down a shaft of light. Grant us pity,  grant us grace. By Thy beauty, we come with no provision but our sins,  with no good deeds to tell of, only hopes. Unless Thy concealing veil doth  cover us, and Thy protection shield and cradle us, what power have these  helpless souls to rise and serve Thee, what substance have these wretched  ones to make a brave display? Thou Who art the Mighty, the All-Powerful,  help us, favour us; withered as we are, revive us with showers from Thy  clouds of grace; lowly as we are, illumine us with bright rays from the  Day-Star of Thy oneness. Cast Thou these thirsty fish into the ocean of  Thy mercy, guide Thou this lost caravan to the shelter of Thy singleness;  to the wellspring of guidance lead Thou the ones who have wandered far  astray, and grant to those who have missed the path a haven within the  precincts of Thy might. Lift Thou to these parched lips the bounteous and  soft-flowing waters of heaven, raise up these dead to everlasting life.  Grant Thou to the blind eyes that will see. Make Thou the deaf to hear,  the dumb to speak. Set Thou the dispirited ablaze, make Thou the heedless  mindful, warn Thou the proud, awaken those who sleep.    Thou art the Mighty, Thou art the Bestower, Thou art the Loving. Verily  Thou art the Beneficent, the Most Exalted.    O ye loved ones of God, ye helpers of this evanescent Servant! When the  Sun of Reality shed its endless bounties from the Dawning-Point of all  desires, and this world of being was lit with that sacred light from pole  to pole, with such intensity did it cast down its rays that it blotted out  the Stygian dark forever, whereupon this earth of dust became the envy of  the spheres of heaven, and this lowly place took on the state and panoply  of the supernal realm. The gentle breeze of holiness blew over it,  scattering abroad sweet savours; the spring winds of heaven passed by it,  and over it, from the Source of all bestowals, were wafted fruitful airs  that carried boundless grace. Then the bright dawn rose, and there came  tidings of great joy. The divine springtime was here, pitching its tents  in this contingent world, so that all creation leapt and danced. The  withered earth brought forth immortal blooms, the dead dust woke to  everlasting life. Then came forth flowers of mystic learning, and,  bespeaking the knowledge of God, fresh greenery from the ground. The  contingent world displayed God's bounteous gifts, the visible world  reflecting the glories of realms that were hidden from sight. God's  summons was proclaimed, the table of the Eternal Covenant was readied, the  cup of the Testament was passed from hand to hand, the universal  invitation was sent forth. Then some among the people were set afire with  the wine of heaven, and some were left without a share of this greatest of  bestowals. The sight and insight of some were illumined by the light of  grace, and there were some who, hearing the anthems of unity, leapt for  joy. There were birds that began to carol in the gardens of holiness,  there were nightingales in the branches of the rose tree of heaven that  raised their plaintive cries. Then were decked and adorned both the  Kingdom on high and the earth below, and this world became the envy of  high heaven. Yet alas, alas, the neglectful have stayed fast in their  heedless sleep, and the foolish have spurned this most sacred of  bestowals. The blind remain shrouded in their veils, the deaf have no  share in what hath come to pass, the dead have no hopes of attaining  thereto, for even as He saith: 'They despair of the life to come, as the  infidels despair that the dwellers in the tombs will rise again.'(1)    As to you, O ye loved ones of God! Loose your tongues and offer Him  thanks; praise ye and glorify the Beauty of the Adored One, for ye have  drunk from this purest of chalices, and ye are cheered and set aglow with  this wine. Ye have detected the sweet scents of holiness, ye have smelled"]]]
