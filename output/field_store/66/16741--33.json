Francisco and his companions, at once laying down  their weapons, were seized and had their arms pinioned.  Mariano was  also bound, and then their conquerors proceeded to clear the decks of  the dead and wounded.  This was soon accomplished; a prize crew was  placed in the schooner; the captives, still pinioned, were transferred  to the deck of the pirate-vessel, and there left to do as they pleased,  while the captain and Bacri descended to the cabin.    Night soon after descended on the sea, the wind fell almost to a calm,  the moon shone round and full in a cloudless sky, and the vessel glided  quietly along, while the rascally crew lay conversing and smoking on her  deck, many of them bearing marks of the recent conflict, and some  sleeping as peacefully as though their hands were guiltless of shedding  human blood, and legitimate trade their occupation.        CHAPTER THREE.    REVEALS SOMETHING SURPRISING IN REGARD TO EUROPEAN FORBEARANCE AND  PIRATIC IMPUDENCE.    Seated on a gun-carriage, apart from his comrades in sorrow, Francisco  Rimini gazed in stern silence upon the moonlit sea, and thought,  perchance, of the little old lady with the rippling mouth, and the  dark-eyed daughter of his adoption.    \"Your fate is a sad one,\" said a deep voice close to his side.    Francisco started, and looked round with indignant surprise at Bacri.    \"None the less sad that a friend has proved false, Jew,\" he said  sternly.  \"It has never been my custom to call any of your race `dog,'  as too many of my creed have done in time past, but I am tempted to  change my custom this night.\"    \"To misname me would do you no good and me no harm,\" replied the Jew  gravely.  \"My race is an accursed one as far as man is concerned, but  man's curse is of no more value than his blessing.\"    \"If these arms were free, Bacri,\" retorted Francisco hotly, \"I would  teach thee that which would prove anything but a blessing to thy  carcase, thou huge caitiff!  I had thought better of thee than thou  didst deserve.--Go, thy bulky presence is distasteful.\"    \"Wherein have I wronged you?\" asked the Jew.    \"Wronged me!\" exclaimed Francisco, with rising wrath, \"art thou not hand  and glove with the chief pirate?  Thinkest thou that my eyes have lost  their power of vision?\"    \"Truly I am acquainted with the corsair, though the acquaintance was  none of my seeking,\" returned the Jew, \"for, as I said before, traders  have dealings with many sorts of men; but I did not advise him to attack  you, and I could not hinder him.\"    \"Scoundrel!\" exclaimed the padrone, \"couldst thou not restrain thine  hand when it knocked the senses out of my boy Mariano?  Wouldst have me  believe that thy huge fists are not subject to thy villainous will, or  that they acted as they did by mere accident, instead of aiding to repel  the pirates?\"    \"I did it to save his life,\" replied Bacri, \"and not only his, but your  own and the lives of all your men.  I saw that Mariano was about to  prevail, and if he had slain the corsair chief, not one of you would  have been alive at this moment.\"    Francisco's wrath when roused was not readily appeased, nevertheless  this statement puzzled him so much that he remained silently gazing at  the Jew, from sheer inability to express his feelings.    \"Listen,\" continued Bacri, drawing nearer, and speaking in a lower tone,  \"the man into whose hands you have fallen is Sidi Hassan, one of the  most noted and daring of the pirates on the Barbary coast.  Escape from  him is impossible.  I know him well, and can assure you that your only  hope of receiving anything that deserves the title of good treatment  depends on your quiet and absolute subjection to his will.  Rebellious  or even independent bearing will insure your speedy and severe  humiliation.  We `dogs of Jews,'\" continued Bacri, with a sad smile,  \"may seem to you to hang our heads rather low sometimes, but I have seen  Christian men, as bold as you are, crawl upon the very dust before these  Turks of Algiers.\"    \"Our fate, then,\" said Francisco, \"is, I suppose, and as I half  suspected, to be slavery in that pirates' nest, Algiers?\"    \"I fear it is,\" replied the Jew, \"unless Providence permits a storm to  set you free; but let me correct your notion of Algiers.  A pirates'  nest it undoubtedly is, but there are others than pirates in the nest,  and some of these are even honest men.\"    \"Ha!\" exclaimed the padrone, quickly and with bitterness; \"is one of  these said honest men a Jew of stalwart frame, and does his connexion  with the piratical nest free him from the bonds to which I and my sons  are doomed?\"    \"To both questions I answer yes,\" replied the Jew.    \"Then a fig for your honesty, Master Bacri!\" said Francisco, with a toss  of his head, in lieu of a snap of his fingers, which in the  circumstances was impossible, \"for I now believe that you knocked  Mariano down simply to save the life of your comrade Sidi Hassan, and  that you will pocket your own share of my ship and cargo.\"    \"I have not the power to alter your belief,\" said the Jew quietly, as he  turned away and left the unfortunate captive to his meditations.    As the night advanced the wind continued to abate, and when morning  broke, the broad breast of the Mediterranean undulated like a sheet of  clear glass, on which was gradually revealed the form of a strange  vessel becalmed not far from the prize.    As soon as it was sufficiently light to permit of objects being clearly  seen, Sidi Hassan fired a gun and showed the Algerine flag.    \"Our luck has changed,\" he said to his first officer, with an air of  satisfaction.  \"Get the boats ready; we will board at once.\"    \"She shows British colours,\" said the mate, regarding the vessel in  question intently through his glass.    \"So she does,\" returned the captain, \"but that device won't go down with  me.  Board her at once, while I bring our broadside to bear.\"    The mate, with two boats full of armed men, soon pulled alongside the  strange sail, and the pirate-vessel was brought round with her broadside  to bear by means of long oars or sweeps.  In a short time the boats  returned with the mortifying intelligence that the papers were all  right, and that the vessel, being in truth a British merchantman, was  not a legitimate prize.  The corsair therefore sailed away under the  influence of a light breeze which had arisen.    At the time of which we write, (about sixty years ago), Algiers was  under the dominion of Turkey, but exercised all the rights of an  independent state.  It may be described as a monstrous blot of barbarism  hanging on the skirts of civilisation.  It was an anomaly too, for it  claimed to be an orthodox power, and was recognised as such by the  nations of Europe, while in reality its chief power consisted in  consummate impudence, founded on pride and ignorance of the strength of  other powers, coupled with the peculiarity of its position and with the  fact that the great nations were too much engaged fighting with each  other to be at leisure to pay attention to it.  Its rulers or Deys were  most of them ignorant men, who had risen, in many cases, from the ranks  of the janissaries or common Turkish soldiery, and its sole occupation  was piracy--piracy pure and simple.    It did not, like other powers, find a pretext for war in the righting of  a supposed or real wrong.  The birds of the Pirates' Nest were much too  simple in their grandeur thus to beat about the bush.  They went  straight to the point.  Without any pretext at all they declared war  with a nation when they had a mind to plunder it, and straightway set  about making prizes of the merchantmen of that nation; at the same time  keeping carefully clear of its cruisers.  If there had been a tangible  grievance, diplomacy might have set it right--but there never was any  grievance, either real or imaginary.  If there had been a worthy fleet  that would come out and face a foe, courage and power might have settled  the question--but there was no such fleet.  The nest possessed only a  few small frigates and a considerable number of boats, large and small,  which crept along the northern shores of Africa, and pounced upon unwary  traders, or made bold dashes at small villages on the southern shores of  Europe and in the isles of the Mediterranean.  Trade was horribly  hampered by them, though they had no ostensible trade of their own;  their influence on southern Europe being comparable only to that of a  wasps' nest under one's window, with this difference, that even wasps,  as a rule, mind their own business, whereas the Algerine pirates minded  the business of everybody else, and called _that_ their own special  vocation!    Like other powers, they took prisoners, but instead of exchanging these  in times of war and freeing them on return of peace, they made  galley-slaves of them all, and held them to ransom.  At all times there  were hundreds of Christian slaves held in bondage.  Even in this present  century, so late as 1816, the Algerine Turks held in captivity thousands  of Christian slaves of all grades and classes, from all parts of Europe,  and these were in many cases treated with a degree of cruelty which is  perhaps equalled, but not surpassed, by the deeds recorded of negro  slavery; and so hopeless were people as to the power or intention of  governments to mend this state of things, that societies were formed in  some of the chief countries in the world, including England, France, and  America, for the express purpose of ransoming Christian slaves from  those dreaded shores of Barbary.    Having said this, the reader will doubtless be prepared to hear that the  civilised world, howling with indignation, assailed, burned, and  exterminated this pirates' nest.  Not at all.  The thing was tolerated;  more than that, it was recognised!  Consuls were actually sent to the  nest to represent Great Britain,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21699"],[0,"The Rover of the Andes: A Tale of Adventure on South America (#3)"],[1,"making preparations for  supper.    The Indian girl, Manuela, with that prompt and humble obedience  characteristic of the race to which she belonged, had gone at once into  the little closet which her companion had pointed out, and was by that  time busily arranging it as a sleeping chamber for the night.        CHAPTER TWO.    COMPACT WITH THE NEW FRIEND AND DISCOVERY OF AN OLD ONE.    Keeping the fire low in order to prevent its being seen by any of the  wandering bands of patriots--_alias_ soldiers, _alias_ banditti--who  might chance to be in the neighbourhood, the three travellers thus  thrown unexpectedly together ate their supper in comparative silence,  Lawrence and Pedro exchanging a comment on the viands now and then, and  the handsome Indian girl sitting opposite to them with her eyes for the  most part fixed on the ground, though now and then she raised them to  take a quick stealthy glance at the huge youth whose appetite did not  seem to be greatly affected by his misfortunes.  Perhaps she was  wondering whether all Englishmen, possessed such innocent kindly faces  and such ungainly though powerful frames.  It may be that she was  contrasting him with the handsome well-knit Pedro at his side.    Whatever her thoughts might have been, the short glances of her lustrous  eyes gave no clue to them, and her tongue was silent, save when she  replied by some brief monosyllable to a remark or query put in the  Indian language occasionally by Pedro.  Sometimes a gleam of the  firelight threw her fine brown features into bold relief, but on these  occasions, when Lawrence Armstrong chanced to observe them, they  conveyed no expression whatever save that of profound gravity, with a  touch, perhaps, of sadness.    The bench being awkwardly situated for a table, they had arranged a  small box, bottom up, instead.  Lawrence and his new acquaintance seated  themselves on the ground, and Manuela used her saddle as a chair.    Towards the end of their meal the two men became more communicative, and  when Pedro had lighted a cigarette, they began to talk of their  immediate future.    \"You don't smoke?\" remarked Pedro in passing.    \"No,\" replied Lawrence.    \"Not like the most of your countrymen,\" said the other.    \"So much the worse,\" rejoined the youth.    \"The worse for them or for you--which?\" asked Pedro, with a significant  glance.    \"No matter,\" returned Lawrence with a laugh.    \"Well, now,\" resumed Pedro, after a few puffs, during the emission of  which his countenance assumed the expression of seriousness, which  seemed most natural to it, \"what do you intend to do?  It is well to  have that point fairly settled to-night, so that there may be no  uncertainty or delay in the morning.  I would not urge the question were  it not that in the morning we must either go on together as travelling  companions, or say our final adieux and part.  I am not in the habit of  prying into men's private affairs, but, to speak the bare truth, I am  naturally interested in one whose father has on more than one occasion  done me good service.  You need not answer me unless you please,  senhor,\" added the man with the air of one who is prepared to retire  upon his dignity at a moment's notice.    \"Thanks, thanks, Pedro,\" said the Englishman, heartily, \"I appreciate  your kindness, and accept your sympathy with gratitude.  Moreover, I am  glad to find that I have been thrown at such a crisis in my fortunes  into the company of one who had regard for my dear father.  But I scarce  know what to do.  I will give you my confidence unreservedly.  Perhaps  you may be able to advise--\"    \"Stay,\" interrupted the other, on whose countenance a slightly stern  expression hovered.  \"Before you give me unreserved confidence, it is  but fair that I should tell you candidly that I cannot pay you back in  kind.  As to private matters, I have none that would be likely to  interest any one under the sun.  In regard to other things--my business  is not my own.  Why I am here and what I mean to do I have no right to  reveal.  Whither I am bound, however, is not necessarily a secret, and  if you choose to travel with me you undoubtedly have a right to know.\"    Young Armstrong expressed himself satisfied.  He might have wished to  know more, but, like Pedro, he had no desire to pry into other men's  affairs, and, being of an open confiding nature, was quite ready to take  his companion on trust, even though he had been less candid and engaging  in manner than he was.  After explaining that he had been educated in  Edinburgh, and trained to the medical profession, he went on to say that  he had been hastily summoned to take charge of the sugar-mill at his  father's death, and that he had expected to find an old overseer, who  would have instructed him in all that he had to do in a business with  which he was totally unacquainted.    \"You see,\" he continued, \"my father always said that he meant to retire  on his fortune, and did not wish me to carry on the business, but, being  naturally an uncommunicative man on business matters, he never gave me  any information as to details.  Of course, I had expected that his  manager here, and his books, would reveal all that I required to know,  but the soldiers have settled that question.  Mill and books have gone  together, and as to manager, clerks, and servants, I know not where they  are.\"    \"Scattered, no doubt,\" said Pedro, \"here, there, and everywhere--only  too glad to escape from a neighbourhood which has been given up to fire  and sword by way of improving its political condition!\"    \"I know not,\" returned Lawrence, sadly.  \"But it would be useless, I  fear, to try to ferret them out.\"    \"Quite useless,\" said Pedro.  \"Besides, what would it avail to talk with  any of them about the affairs of a place that is now in ashes?  But if  your father spoke of his fortune, he must have had at least some of it  in a bank somewhere.\"    \"True, but I don't know where.  All I know is that he once mentioned  casually in one of his letters that he was going to Buenos Ayres, where  he had some property.\"    \"Indeed!\" exclaimed Pedro.  \"Come, that may help you to decide, for I am  myself going to Buenos Ayres, and can guide you there if disposed to go.  Only, you will have to make up your mind to a pretty long and hard  journey, for duty requires me to go by a devious route.  You must know,\"  he continued, lighting another cigarette, \"that I am pledged to take  that girl to her father, who lives not far from Buenos Ayres.\"    He pointed as he spoke to Manuela, who, having laid her head on her  saddle, appeared to have fallen asleep.    \"Her father must be a chief, I should think, to judge from her  dignified, graceful carriage, as well as her fine features,\" said  Lawrence in a low tone.    \"Yes, he is a chief--a great chief,\" returned Pedro, gazing at his  cigarette in a meditative mood--\"a very great chief.  You see, she  happened to be living with friends on the western side of the mountains  when this war between Chili and Peru broke out, and her father naturally  wants to get her out of danger.  The old chief once saved my life, so,  you see, I am bound both by duty and gratitude to rescue his daughter.\"    \"Indeed you are, and a pleasant duty it must be,\" returned Lawrence with  an approving nod; \"but don't you think it might have been wise to have  rescued some other female, a domestic for instance, to keep her company?  The poor girl will feel very lonely on such a long journey as you speak  of.\"    Pedro again looked musingly at his cigarette, and flipped off the ash  with his little finger.    \"You have not had much experience of war, young man,\" he said, \"if you  think that in cases of rescue men can always arrange things comfortably,  and according to the rules of propriety.  When towns and villages are in  flames, when plunder and rapine run riot everywhere, and little children  are spitted on the bayonets of patriots, as is often the case even in  what men have agreed to term civilised warfare, one is glad to escape  with the skin of one's teeth.  Yet I was not as regardless of Manuela's  comfort as you seem to think.  A poor woman who had nursed her when a  child volunteered to accompany us, and continued with us on the first  part of our journey; but the exertion, as I had feared, was too much for  her.  She caught a fever and died, so that we were forced to come on  alone.  If you join us, however, I shall be greatly pleased, for two can  always make a better fight than one, and in these unsettled times there  is no saying what we may fall in with in crossing the mountains.\"    \"But why expose the poor girl to such risks?\" asked Lawrence.  \"Surely  there must be some place of safety nearer than Buenos Ayres, to which  you might conduct her?\"    \"Senhor Armstrong,\" replied the man, with a return of his stern  expression, \"I have told you that my business is urgent.  Not even the  rescue of my old friend's daughter can turn me aside from it.  When  Manuela begged me to take her with me, I pointed out the difficulties  and dangers of the route, and the necessity for my pursuing a long and  devious course, but she said she feared to remain where she was; that,  being young, strong, and accustomed to an active life, she felt sure she  was equal to the journey; that she could trust me, and that she knew her  father would approve of her taking the step.  I agreed, with some  hesitation.  It turned out that the girl was right in her fears, for  before we left the town it was attacked by the troops of Chili.  The  Peruvians made but a poor resistance, and it was carried by assault.  When I saw that all hope of saving the place was gone, I managed to  bring Manuela and her nurse away in safety.  As I have told you, the  nurse died, and now--here we are alone.  Manuela chooses to run the  risk.  I will not turn aside from my duty.  If you choose to join us,  the girl will be safer--at least"]]]
