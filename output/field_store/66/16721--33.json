These passengers represented a dozen or so different  nationalities, and were bound for all sorts of places in East, Central,  and South Africa. Some were government officials going out to their  stations, some were army officers, some were professional hunters, and  some were private hunters going out \"for\" to shoot.    There were also a number of women on board and some children. I don't  know how many children there were, but in the early morning there seemed  to be a great number.    These Indian Ocean steamers are usually filled with an interesting lot  of passengers. At first you may only speculate as to who and what they  are and whither they are bound, but as the days go by you get acquainted  with many of them and find out who nearly everybody is and all about  him. On this steamer there were several interesting people. First in  station and importance was Sir Percy Girouard, the newly appointed  governor of British East Africa, who was going out to Nairobi to take  his position. Sir Percy is a splendid type of man, only about forty-two  years old, but with a career that has been filled with brilliant  achievements. He was born in Canada and was knighted in 1900. He looks  as Colonel Roosevelt looked ten years ago, and, in spite of a firm,  definite personality of great strength, is also courteous and kindly. He  has recently been the governor of northern Nigeria, and before that time  served in South Africa and the Soudan. It was of him that Lord Kitchener  said \"the Soudan Railway would never have been built without his  services.\"    The new governor was accompanied by two staff officers, one a Scotchman  and the other an Irishman, and both of them with the clean, healthy look  of the young British army officer. There would be a big reception at  Mombasa, no doubt, with bands a-playing and fireworks popping, when the  ship arrived with the new executive.    [Photograph: By courtesy of W.D. Boyce. \"Crossing the Line\"  Ceremonies]    [Photograph: Mr. Stephenson, Mr. and Mrs. Akeley and Mr. McCutcheon.  Courtesy of Boyce Balloonagraph Expedition]    [Drawing: _Before and After Outfitting_]    There were also several officials with high-sounding titles who were  going out to their stations in German East Africa. These gentlemen were  mostly accompanied by wives and babies and between them they imparted a  spirited scene of domesticity to the life on shipboard. The effect of a  man wheeling a baby carriage about the deck was to make one think of  some peaceful place far from the deck of a steamer.    Little Tim was the life of the ship. He was a little boy aged eighteen  months, who began life at Sombra, in Nyassaland, British Central Africa.  Just now he was returning from England with his father and mother.  Little Tim had curly hair, looked something like a brownie, and was  brimming over with energy and curiosity every moment that he was awake.  If left alone five minutes he was quite likely to try to climb up the  rigging. Consequently he was never left alone, and the decks were  constantly echoing with a fond mother's voice begging him not to \"do  that,\" or to \"come right here, Tim.\" One of Tim's chief diversions was  to divest himself of all but his two nearest articles of wear and sit in  the scuppers with the water turned on. A crowd of passengers was usually  grouped around him and watched his manoeuvers with intense interest.  He was probably photographed a hundred times and envied by everybody on  board. It was so fearfully hot in the Red Sea that to be seated in  running water with almost no clothes on seemed about the nicest possible  way to pass the time.    [Drawing: _Little Tim_]    There was a professional elephant hunter on board. He was a quiet,  reserved sort of man, pleasant, and not at all bloodthirsty in  appearance. He had spent twenty years shooting in Africa, and had killed  three hundred elephants. On his last trip, during which he spent nearly  four years in the Congo, he secured about two and one-half tons of  ivory. This great quantity of tusks, worth nearly five dollars a pound,  brought him over twenty thousand dollars, after paying ten per cent. to  the Congo government. The Belgians place no limit upon the number of  elephants one may shoot, just so they get their rake-off. In British  territory, however, sportsmen are limited to only two elephants a year  to those holding licenses to shoot. Our elephant hunter friend was now  on his way back to shoot some more.    [Drawing: _The Elephant Hunter and His Bag_]    There was another interesting character on board who caused many of us  to stop and think. He was a young British army officer who was mauled by  a lioness several months ago in Somaliland. He now walked with a decided  limp and was likely to lose his commission in the army because of  physical infirmities. He was cheerful, pleasant, and looked hopefully  forward to a time when he could have another go at a lion. This is the  way the thing happened: Last March he was shooting in Somaliland and ran  across a lioness. He shot her, but failed to disable her. She  immediately charged, chewed up his leg, arm and shoulder, and was then  killed by his Somali gunbearer. He was days from any help. He dressed  his own wounds and the natives tried to carry him to the nearest  settlement. Finally his bandages were exhausted, the natives deserted,  and it was only after frightful suffering that he reached help. In three  weeks blood poisoning set in, as is usual after the foul teeth of a lion  have entered the flesh, and for several months he was close to death.  Now he was up and about, cheerful and sunny, but a serious object lesson  to the lion hunters bound for the lair of the lion.    In the smoking-room of the _Adolph Woermann_ was a bronze bust of Mr.  Woermann presented by himself. Whether he meant to perpetuate his own  memory is not vital to the story. The amusing feature lies in the fact  that some irreverent passenger, whose soul was dead to the sacredness of  art, put a rough slouch hat on Mr. Woermann one night, with  side-splitting results. Mr. W. is a man with a strong, intelligent  German face, something like that of Prince Henry, and in the statue  appears with bare neck and shoulders. The addition of a rakish slouch  hat produced a startling effect, greatly detracting from the strictly  artistic, but adding much to the interest of the bust. It looked very  much as though he had been ashore at Aden and had come back on board  feeling the way a man does when he wants his hat on the side of his  head. Still, what can a shipowner expect who puts a nude bust of himself  in his own ship?    [Drawing: _Having Fun with Mr. Woermann_]    [Drawing: _An African Hair-Cut_]    The ship's barber was the Associated Press of the ship's company, and  his shop was the Park Row of the vessel. He had plenty of things to talk  about and more than enough words to express them. Every vague rumor that  floated about was sure to find lodgment in the barber shop, just as a  piece of driftwood finally reaches the beach. He knew all the secrets of  the voyage and told them freely.    One day I went down to have my hair trimmed. He asked if I'd have it  done African style. \"How's that?\" I inquired. \"Shaved,\" said he, and  \"No,\" said I. A number of the Germans on board were adopting the African  style of hair-cut, and the effect was something depressing. Every bump  that had lain dormant under a mat of hair at once assumed startling  proportions, and red ears that were retiring suddenly stuck out from the  pale white scalp like immense flappers. A devotee of this school of  tonsorial art had a peeled look that did not commend him to favorable  mention in artistic circles. But the flies, they loved it, so it was an  ill wind that blew no good.    The Red Sea has a well-earned reputation of being hot. We expected a  certain amount of sultriness, but not in such lavish prodigality as it  was delivered. The first day out from Suez found the passengers peeling  off unnecessary clothes, and the next day found the men sleeping out on  deck. There wasn't much sleeping. The band concert lasted until  ten-thirty, then the three Germans who were trying to drink all the beer  on board gave a nightly saengerfest that lasted until one o'clock, and  then the men who wash down the decks appeared at four. Between one and  four it was too hot to sleep, so that there wasn't much restful repose  on the ship until we got out of the Red Sea.    [Drawing: _We Slept on Deck in the Red Sea_]    Down at the end of the Red Sea are the straits of Bab-el-Mandeb. In the  middle of the straits is the island of Perim, a sun-baked, bare and  uninviting chunk of land that has great strategic value and little else.  It absolutely commands the entrance to the Red Sea, and, naturally, is  British. Nearly all strategic points in the East are British, from  Gibraltar to Singapore. A lighthouse, a signal station, and a small  detachment of troops are the sole points of interest in Perim, and as  one rides past one breathes a fervent prayer of thanksgiving that he is  not one of the summer colony on Perim.    They tell a funny story about an English officer who was sent to Perim  to command the detachment. At the end of six months an official order  was sent for his transfer, because no one is expected to last longer  than six months without going crazy or committing suicide. To the great  surprise of the war office a letter came back stating that the officer  was quite contented at Perim, that he liked the peace and quiet of the  place, and begged that he be given leave to remain another six months.  The war office was amazed, and it gladly gave him the extension. At the  end of a year the same exchange of letters occurred and again he was  given the extension.    I don't know how long this continued, but in the end the war office  discovered"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2126"],[0,"The Quest of the Sacred Slipper (#3)"],[1,"of the official detective force.    In appearance Bristol suggests an Anglo-Indian officer, and at the  time of which I write he had recently returned from Jamaica and his  face was as bronzed as a sailor's.  One would never take Bristol  for a detective.  As he seated himself in the armchair, without  preamble I plunged into my story.  He listened gravely.    \"What sort of house is Professor Deeping's?\" he asked suddenly.    \"I have no idea,\" I replied, \"beyond the fact that it is somewhere  in Dulwich.\"    \"May I use your telephone?\"    \"Certainly.\"    Very quickly Bristol got into communication with the superintendent  of P Division.  A brief delay, and the man came to the telephone  whose beat included the road wherein Professor Deeping's house was  situated.    \"Why!\" said Bristol, hanging up the receiver after making a number  of inquiries, \"it's a sort of rambling cottage in extensive grounds.  There's only one servant, a manservant, and he sleeps in a detached  lodge.  If the Professor is really in danger of attack he could not  well have chosen a more likely residence for the purpose!\"    \"What shall you do?  What do you make of it all?\"    \"As I see the case,\" he said slowly, \"it stands something like this:  Professor Deeping has...\"    The telephone bell began to ring.    I took up the receiver.    \"Hullo!  Hullo.\"    \"Cavanagh!--is that Cavanagh?\"    \"Yes!  yes!  who is that?\"    \"Deeping!  I have rung up the police, and they are sending some  one.  But I wish...\"    His voice trailed off.  The sound of a confused and singular uproar  came to me.    \"Hullo!\" I cried.  \"Hullo!\"    A shriek--a deathful, horrifying cry--and a distant babbling alone  answered me.  There was a crash.  Clearly, Deeping had dropped the  receiver.  I suppose my face blanched.    \"What is it?\" asked Bristol anxiously.    \"God knows what it is!\" I said.  \"Deeping has met with some  mishap--\"    When, over the wires--    \"Hassan of Aleppo!\" came a dying whisper.  \"Hassan ... of  Aleppo...\"          CHAPTER IV    THE OBLONG BOX      \"You had better wait for us,\" said Bristol to the taxi-man.    \"Very good, sir.  But I shan't be able to take you further back than  the Brixton Garage.  You can get another cab there, though.\"    A clock chimed out--an old-world chime in keeping with the  loneliness, the curiously remote loneliness, of the locality.  Less  than five miles from St. Paul's are spots whereto, with the  persistence of Damascus attar, clings the aroma of former days.  This iron gateway fronting the old chapel was such a spot.    Just within stood a plain-clothes man, who saluted my companion  respectfully.    \"Professor Deeping,\" I began.    The man, with a simple gesture, conveyed the dreadful news.    \"Dead!  dead!\" I cried incredulously.    He glanced at Bristol.    \"The most mysterious case I have ever had anything to do with,  sir,\" he said.    The power of speech seemed to desert me.  It was unthinkable that  Deeping, with whom I had been speaking less than an hour ago,  should now be no more; that some malign agency should thus  murderously have thrust him into the great borderland.    In that kind of silence which seems to be peopled with whispering  spirits we strode forward along the elm avenue.  It was very dark  where the moon failed to penetrate.  The house, low and rambling,  came into view, its facade bathed in silver light.  Two of the  visible windows were illuminated.  A sort of loggia ran along one  side.    On our left, as we made for this, lay a black ocean of shrubbery.  It intruded, raggedly, upon the weed-grown path, for neglect was  the keynote of the place.    We entered the cottage, crossed the tiny lobby, and came to the  study.  A man, evidently Deeping's servant, was sitting in a chair  by the door, his head sunken in his hands.  He looked up,  haggard-faced.    \"My God!  my God!\" he groaned.  \"He was locked in, gentlemen!  He  was locked in; and yet something murdered him!\"    \"What do you mean?\" said Bristol.  \"Where were you?\"    \"I was away on an errand, sir.  When I returned, the police were  knocking the door down.  He was locked in!\"    We passed him, entering the study.    It was a museum-like room, lighted by a lamp on the littered  table.  At first glance it looked as though some wild thing had  run amok there.  The disorder was indescribable.    \"Touched nothing, of course?\" asked Bristol sharply of the officer  on duty.    \"Nothing, sir.  It's just as we found it when we forced the door.\"    \"Why did you force the door?\"    \"He rung us up at the station and said that something or somebody  had got into the house.  It was evident the poor gentleman's nerve  had broken down, sir.  He said he was locked in his study.  When  we arrived it was all in darkness--but we thought we heard sounds  in here.\"    \"What sort of sounds?\"    \"Something crawling about!\"    Bristol turned.    \"Key is in the lock on the inside of the door,\" he said.  \"Is that  where you found it?\"    \"Yes, sir!\"    He looked across to where the brass knob of a safe gleamed dully.    \"Safe locked?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    Professor Deeping lay half under the table, a spectacle so ghastly  that I shall not attempt to describe it.    \"Merciful heavens!\" whispered Bristol.  \"He's nearly decapitated!\"    I clutched dizzily at the mantelpiece.  It was all so utterly,  incredibly horrible.  How had Deeping met his death?  The windows  both were latched and the door had been locked from within!    \"You searched for the murderer, of course?\" asked Bristol.    \"You can see, sir,\" replied the officer, \"that there isn't a spot  in the room where a man could hide!   And there was nobody  in here when we forced the door!\"    \"Why!\" cried my companion suddenly.  \"The Professor has a chisel  in his hand!\"    \"Yes.  I think he must have been trying to prise open that box  yonder when he was attacked.\"    Bristol and I looked, together, at an oblong box which lay upon  the floor near the murdered man.  It was a kind of small  packing case, addressed to Professor Deeping, and evidently had  not been opened.    \"When did this arrive?\" asked Bristol.  Lester, the Professor's  man, who had entered the room, replied shakily--    \"It came by carrier, sir, just before I went out.\"    \"Was he expecting it?\"    \"I don't think so.\"    Inspector Bristol and the officer dragged the box fully into the  light.  It was some three feet long by one foot square, and solidly  constructed.    \"It is perfectly evident,\" remarked Bristol, \"that the murderer  stayed to search for--\"    \"The key of the safe!\"    \"Exactly.  If the men really heard sounds here, it would appear that  the assassin was still searching at that time.\"    \"I assure you,\" the officer interrupted, \"that there was no living  thing in the room when we entered.\"    Bristol and I looked at one another in horrified wonder.    \"It's incomprehensible!\" he said.    \"See if the key is in the place mentioned by the Professor, Mr.  Cavanagh, whilst I break the box.\"    I went to a great, open bookcase, which the frantic searcher seemed  to have overlooked.  Removing the bulky \"Assyrian Mythology,\" there,  behind the volume, lay an envelope, containing a key, and a short  letter.  Not caring to approach more closely to the table and to  that which lay beneath it, I was peering at the small writing, in  the semi-gloom by the bookcase, when Bristol cried--    \"This box is unopenable by ordinary means!  I shall have to smash  it!\"    At his words, I joined him where he knelt on the floor.  Mysteriously, the chest had defied all his efforts.    \"There's a pick-axe in the garden,\" volunteered Lester.  \"Shall I  bring it?\"    \"Yes.\"    The man ran off.    \"I see the key is safe,\" said Bristol.  \"Possibly the letter may  throw some light upon all this.\"    \"Let us hope so,\" I replied.  \"You might read it.\"    He took the letter from my hand, stepped up to the table, and by  the light of the lamp read as follows--    My Dear Cavanagh,--    It has now become apparent to me that my life is in imminent danger.  You know of the inexplicable outrages which marked my homeward  journey, and if this letter come to your hand it will be because  these have culminated in my death.    The idea of a pursuing scimitar is not new to me.  This phenomenon,  which I have now witnessed three times, is fairly easy of  explanation, but its significance is singular.  It is said to be  one of the devices whereby the Hashishin warn those whom they have  marked down for destruction, and is called, in the East, \"The  Scimitar of Hassan.\"    The Hashishin were the members of a Moslem secret society, founded  in 1090 by one Hassan of Khorassan.  There is a persistent tradition  in parts of the Orient that this sect still flourishes in Assyria,  under the rule of a certain Hassan of Aleppo, the Sheikh-al-jebal,  or supreme lord of the Hashishin. My careful inquiries, however,  at the time that I was preparing matter for my \"Assyrian Mythology,\"  failed to discover any trace of such a person or such a group.    I accordingly assumed Hassan to be a myth--a first cousin to the  ginn.  I was wrong.  He exists.  And by my supremely rash act I  have incurred his vengeance, for Hassan of Aleppo is the  self-appointed guardian of the traditions and relics of Mohammed.  And I have Stolen one of the holy slippers of the Prophet!    He, with some of his servants, has followed me from Mecca to  England.  My precautions have enabled me to retain the relic, but  you have seen what fate befell all those others who even touched  the receptacle containing it.    If I fall a victim to the Hashishin, I am uncertain how you, as my  confidant, will fare.  Therefore I have locked the slipper in my  safe and to you entrust the key.  I append particulars of the lock  combination; but I warn you--do not open the safe.  If their  wrath be visited upon you, your possession of the key may prove a  safeguard.    Take the copy of \"Assyrian Mythology.\"  You "]]]
