Moralising, however, will not  help you, my boy; for if I know anything at all about you it is that you  are not the sort of character to make such a horrible mess of your life  as that poor wretch has done.  But now, the question is: What can I do  to help you and your respected mother out of this slough into which  another man's weakness and sin have plunged you both?  Not very much, I  am afraid; for I cannot restore to you the property of which you are  robbed.  That appears to be gone beyond recall.  But I can do this for  you--and it may possibly help you a little--I can give you a letter of  introduction to a man who is under very heavy obligations to me, and  who--being a thoroughly good fellow--will be more than glad to discharge  those obligations if I will only afford him the opportunity to do so.  You shall go to him and give him full and complete particulars of this  terrible misfortune that has befallen you; and if there is anything at  all to be saved out of the wreckage, he will save it for you, without  fee and without reward--for my sake.  He, too, is a solicitor, but an  honest one, as many still are, thank God; and it is a solicitor whose  aid will be most useful to you in the unravelling of this tangled  skein.\"    \"I say, Doctor, that is awfully good of you,\" exclaimed Dick, struggling  to conceal his emotion of gratitude, after the manner of the Englishman,  but not altogether succeeding.  \"If the matter concerned myself alone,\"  he continued, \"I would not let you do this thing for me; but I must  think of my poor mother, and for her sake must humble my pride and  suppress the assertion of my independence so far as to accept your help,  so kindly and generously offered.  And here let me say that there is no  man on earth whose help I would so willingly accept as yours,\" he  blundered on, dimly conscious that there had been something of  ungraciousness in his speech; and so stopped dead, overcome with shame  and confusion.    \"That is all right, my dear boy,\" returned Humphreys, smilingly laying  his hand on Dick's shoulder; \"I know exactly how you feel, and very  heartily respect your sense of sturdy independence, which is very  estimable in its way, so long as it is not carried too far.  But, as a  matter of fact, Dick, none of us is absolutely independent in this  world, for almost every moment of our lives we are dependent upon  somebody for assistance, in one shape or another, and it is not until  that assistance is withheld that we are brought to realise the extent to  which we are individually dependent upon our fellow creatures.  But I am  moralising again--a habit which seems to be growing upon me since I came  among these poor folk down here, and have been brought face to face with  such a vast amount of misery that can be directly traced to ignorance  and crime.  Just pass me over that stationery cabinet, will you?  Thanks!  Now I will write to my friend Graham at once, and you had  better call upon him at his chambers in Lincoln's Inn to-morrow morning  at ten o'clock sharp, which is about the only hour of the day when you  can be reasonably certain of finding him.\"    When Dick called upon Humphreys' friend Graham, upon the following  morning, and sent in his letter of introduction, he soon had abundant  evidence that the rising young solicitor was quite as busy a man as the  Doctor had represented him to be; yet he was not too busy to respond  promptly to his friend's claim upon him, actually leaving an important-  looking client waiting in his outer office while he interviewed Dick and  listened with the utmost patience to the story which the latter had to  tell, questioning him occasionally, and making notes of his answers upon  a writing pad.  At length, after an interview of over half an hour's  duration, Graham closed the pad sharply and, rising, extended his hand  to Dick, saying:    \"Thank you, Mr Maitland.  I believe I have now all the essential facts;  and you may assure my friend Humphreys that I will take up the case with  the utmost pleasure, and without loss of time; also that I will do my  best for you and your mother.  From what you tell me I am inclined to  imagine that the wreck of Cuthbertson's affairs will prove to be pretty  complete, therefore I very strongly advise you not to reckon upon my  being able to save anything for you out of the wreckage; but if there  should by any chance be anything, you shall have it.  And now, good  morning!  I am very pleased to have made your acquaintance; and as soon  as I have anything definite to communicate I will write to you.  Remember me very kindly to Humphreys.  Good morning!\"    The interview was certainly not very encouraging; but on the other hand  it was by no means disappointing; for Dick had already quite made up his  mind that every penny of his mother's money was lost.  It was,  therefore, a very pleasant surprise to him when, about a fortnight  later, a letter came from Graham announcing that he had succeeded in  rescuing close upon five hundred pounds for Mrs Maitland from the ruins  of Cuthbertson's estate, and that the good lady could have the money by  presenting herself at the writer's office and going through certain  formalities.        CHAPTER TWO.    DICK MAKES UP HIS MIND.    It was late in the evening of the day upon which Mrs Maitland, having  fulfilled the formalities required of her by Graham, had received from  him a cheque for the sum of four hundred and eighty-seven pounds,  seventeen shillings, and eightpence, which, apart from the house in  which she lived, represented all that remained to her of the very  comfortable fortune left to her by her late husband.  Dick had escorted  his mother up to town, and, upon the conclusion of the transaction, had  taken her back to The Cedars; after which he had made the best of his  way to 19 Paradise Street; for the moment had now arrived when he must  come to an understanding with his friend Dr Julian Humphreys, and  consult with him respecting the future.  Ten o'clock had struck a few  minutes ago, a belated patient had been attended to and dismissed, the  surgery had been closed by the simple process of drawing down the blind  and locking the outer door, and now the two friends were sitting  opposite each other in that same drug-scented apartment, conversing  earnestly together, as Humphreys pulled contemplatively, yet somewhat  vexedly, at a brier pipe which had seen so much service that it was now  charred down to about half its original size.    \"The fact is,\" remarked Dick, in continuance of their conversation,  \"that there is no other course open to me; for I am resolved that I will  not touch a farthing of the money that your friend Graham has so  cleverly rescued from the ruins of Cuthbertson's estate; every stiver of  it will be required for the maintenance of the poor Mater while I am  away.  And I must go away, because, as you yourself have admitted, there  is no employment or occupation of any kind here at home to which, in my  present condition of unpreparedness, I could turn my hand with any hope  of earning a sufficient income to maintain her and myself, though ever  so modestly; even if posts were to be had for the asking, which--in this  country, at all events--they are not.  You know that to be the plain,  unvarnished truth, do you not?\"    \"Yes,\" Humphreys answered unhesitatingly, \"it is true--unfortunately.\"    \"Very well, then,\" Dick resumed; \"that being the case, the next question  is: Where am I to go, and what am I to do, in order to earn enough money  to maintain myself and my mother in the meantime, and eventually to  restore her to that position of security of which she was robbed by that  rascal Cuthbertson?\"    \"_De mortuis nil nisi bonum_!\" reproved Humphreys gravely.  \"The poor  chap has gone to answer for his sins, whatever they may have been, and  there is an end of him, so far as you are concerned.  To rail at him  now, and speak of him disparagingly, will not hurt him, or do you any  good, Dick, my friend, so do not unnecessarily bespatter his memory.  This by the way.  And now to return to our muttons.  The problem that  you propound is indeed a hard one to solve; to many it would probably  appear an impossibility.  But, although I am by no means an old man, I  have been long enough in this world to have recognised that what many  people deem impossibilities are nothing of the sort, if only one has the  grit to face and tackle them.  It is grit, my boy, that makes  impossibilities possible, and I believe you possess that quality in  sufficient measure to enable you to accomplish great things.  The  question is: What is the particular great thing which will meet your  case?  What is the work which you are best fitted to do?  You are  already very well up in the profession which you have chosen.  There is  many a man in successful practice to-day who knows less about it than  you do; but, unfortunately, you are not yet `qualified', therefore you  cannot set up for yourself, even if you could afford the time to create  a practice--which you cannot.  And as to becoming an unqualified  assistant, that of course is out of the question; the pay is altogether  too poor to justify the entertainment of that idea.  But there are  countries where the restrictions are not nearly so great as they are in  England; and there are others--beyond the pale of civilisation--where no  restrictions at all exist, and where a clever man, with plenty of grit  to back him up, might perhaps do remarkably well.  Still, to penetrate  to such countries a man must take his life in his hands, and, even then,  all his courage may prove insufficient to save him from an unspeakable,  horrible death.  Now, what can you do besides doctoring?\"    \"Nothing that will help me in my present strait,\" answered Maitland.  \"I  can sail a boat, swim, ride, or drive a horse, and I can shoot straight;  consequently if I possessed sufficient influence I "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21070"],[0,"A Middy of the Slave Squadron: A West African Story (#3)"],[1,"to attend to the lowering of the gig, which hung from  davits over the stern, a hand was suddenly laid upon my arm, and,  turning, I found myself confronted by Cupid, the Krooboy servant who  \"did for us\" in the midshipmen's berth.  His eyes were aglow with  excitement, he carried a short-handled hatchet, with a head somewhat  bigger and heavier than that of a ship's tomahawk, in his hand, and he  was naked, save for a pair of dungaree trousers, the legs of which were  rolled up above his knees.    \"Mr Fortescue, sar, I fit for go in dem boat wid you, sar,\" he  whispered eagerly.    \"Yes, I quite believe it, Cupid,\" I replied.  \"But you know perfectly  well that I cannot give you permission to join the gig's crew.  If the  captain had been anxious to have the pleasure of your company I feel  sure that he would have mentioned the fact.  Besides, if you should  happen to be killed, what would become of us poor midshipmen?\"    A suppressed chuckle, and a gleam of white teeth through the darkness,  betrayed Cupid's appreciation of the compliment subtly conveyed in the  suggestion that the budding admirals inhabiting the midshipmen's berth  aboard H.M.S.  _Psyche_ would suffer, should he unhappily be slain in  the impending conflict, but he hastened to reassure me.    \"No fear, sar,\" he whispered.  \"Dem slaber no lib for kill me.  I,  Cupid, too much plenty black for see in de dark; an' if dey no see me,  dey no kill.  Savvey?  _Please_, Mr Fortescue, sar.  I no lib for fight  too much plenty long time.\"    \"Look here, Cupid,\" I replied.  \"It is no use for you to ask me for  permission to go in the gig, for I cannot give it you.  But,\"--  meaningly--\"if you were to stow yourself away in the eyes of the gig it  is just possible that the captain might not notice you until we had got  too far from the ship to turn back.  Only don't let me see you doing it,  that's all.\"    \"Dat all right, sar,\" answered the black, with a sigh of extreme  content.  \"If you no look for dem Cupid you no see um.\"  And he turned  and ostentatiously walked away forward.    The boats having been gently and carefully lowered into the water  without a splash, or so much as a single tell-tale squeak from the  tackle-blocks--the pins and bushes of which were habitually overhauled  at frequent intervals and kept well lubricated with a mixture of melted  tallow and plumbago--the crews took their places, each man carefully  depositing his drawn cutlass on the bottom-boards between his feet, and  we shoved off with muffled oars, the three boats pulling abreast, with  about a ship's length between each; so that if perchance we should  happen to be seen, we should present as small a target as possible to  aim at.    We pulled slowly and with the utmost caution, for the twofold reason  that we had not yet caught sight of our quarry and only knew in a  general sort of way that she was somewhere to seaward of us, and because  we were anxious to avoid premature discovery from the splash of our  oars.  It was of course perfectly right and proper that we should  observe all the precautions that I have indicated; for if we could but  contrive to creep up alongside the stranger without being detected, it  would undoubtedly mean the prevention of much loss of life.  But,  personally, I had very little hope of our being able to do so; for the  night was so breathlessly still that, if any sort of look-out at all  were being kept aboard the stranger--and slavers usually slept with one  eye open--they must surely have caught some hint of our proximity,  careful as we had been to maintain as complete silence as possible while  making our preparations.  Besides, as ill-luck would have it, the water  was in an unusually brilliant phosphorescent condition just then, the  slightest disturbance of it caused a silvery glow that could be seen a  mile away; and, be as silent as we might, the dip of our oars and the  passage of the boats through the water set up such a blaze as could not  fail to betray us, should a man happen to glance in our direction.    At length, when we had pulled about half a mile, as nearly as I could  judge, I detected a slight suspicion of a softening in the velvety  blackness of the sky in the eastern quarter.  It brightened, even as I  looked, and a solitary star, low down in the sky, seemed to flicker,  faintly and more faintly, for half a dozen seconds, and then disappear.    \"The dawn is coming, sir,\" I whispered to the skipper, by whose side I  was sitting, \"and in another minute or two we ought to--ah! there she  is.  Do you see her, sir?\"  And I pointed in the direction of a faint,  ghostlike blotch that had suddenly appeared at a spot some three points  on our port bow.    \"Where away?\" demanded the skipper, instinctively raising his hand to  shade his eyes; but he had scarcely lifted it to the height of his  shoulder when he too caught sight of the object.    \"Ay,\" he exclaimed, \"I see her.  And a big craft she is, too; a barque,  apparently.  Surely that cannot be the craft that we are after?  Yet it  looks very like her.  If so, she must have slipped out of the river with  the last of the land-breeze last night, and lain becalmed all night  where she is.  Now what are the other boats about that they have not  seen her?  Parkinson,\" to the coxswain, \"show that lantern for a moment  to the other boats, but take care to shield it with--ah! never mind,  there are both their lights.  Give way, men.  Put me alongside under her  mizen chains, my lad.  Either side; I don't care which.\"    While the captain had been speaking the faint, ghostly glimmer that I  had detected had resolved itself into the spectral semblance of a large  ship clothed from her trucks down with canvas upon which the rapidly  growing light of the advancing dawn was falling and thus rendering it  just barely visible against its dark background of sky.    In the tropics day comes and goes with a rush, and, even while the  skipper had been speaking, the object which had first revealed itself to  me, a minute earlier, as a mere wan, ghostly suggestion had assumed  solidity and definiteness of form, and now stood out against the sky  behind her as a full-rigged ship of some seven hundred and fifty tons  burthen, her hull painted bright green, and coppered to the water-line.  She was lying stern-on to us, and sat deep in the water, from which  latter fact one inferred that she had her cargo of slaves on board and  had doubtless, as the skipper conjectured, come out of the river with  the last of the land-breeze during the previous night, and had remained  becalmed near us, and, we hoped, quite unaware of our proximity all  night.  She was now within a cable's length of the boats, but, lying as  she was, dead stern-on to us, we in the gig were unable to see how many  guns she carried, which was, however, an advantage to us, since, however  many guns she might mount on her broadsides, she could bring none of  them to bear upon us.  We saw, however, that she carried two stern-  chasers--long nine's, apparently--and now, in the hope of dashing  alongside before those two guns could be cast loose and brought to bear  upon us, the captain stood up in the stern-sheets of the gig and waved  his arm to the other boats as a signal to them to give way--for, with  the coming of the daylight we could not possibly hope to remain  undiscovered above a second or two longer.    Indeed the boats' crews had scarcely bent their backs in response to the  signal when there arose a sudden startled outcry on board the ship,  followed by a volley of hurried commands and the hasty trampling of feet  upon her decks.  But we were so close to her, when discovered, and the  surprise was so complete, that her crew had no time to do anything  effective in the way of defence; and in little over a couple of minutes  we had swept up alongside, clambered in over her lofty bulwarks, driven  her crew below, and were in full possession of the _Dona Isabella_ of  Havana, mounting twelve guns, with a crew of forty-six Spaniards,  Portuguese, and half-castes, constituting as ruffianly a lot as I had  ever met with.  She had a cargo of seven hundred and forty negroes on  board, and was far and away the finest prize that had thus far fallen to  the lot of the _Psyche_.  So valuable, indeed, was she that Captain  Harrison decided not to trust her entirely to a prize crew, but to  escort her to Sierra Leone in the corvette; and some two hours later,  having meanwhile made all the necessary dispositions, the two craft  trimmed sail with the first of the sea-breeze and hauled up for Sierra  Leone, where we arrived a week later after an uneventful passage.        CHAPTER TWO.    IN THE FERNAN VAZ RIVER.    While we were awaiting the formal condemnation of the _Dona Isabella_ by  the Mixed Commission, and the trial of her crew upon the charge of  piracy, Captain Harrison, our skipper, busily employed himself, as was  his wont, in hunting up information relative to the movements, present  and prospective, of the slavers upon the coast.  And this was not quite  so difficult to do as might at first be imagined; for, Sierra Leone  being the headquarters, so to speak, of the British Slave Squadron, the  persons actually engaged in the slave-trade found that it paid them well  to maintain agents there for the sole purpose of picking up every  possible item of information relative to the movements and doings of  that squadron.  For it not unfrequently happened that, to those behind  the scenes, an apparently trivial and seemingly quite worthless bit of  information, an imprudent word dropped by an unwary officer respecting  one of our vessels, enabled the acute ones to calculate so closely that  they often succeeded in making a dash into some river, shipping a cargo  of slaves, and getting clear away to sea again only a few hours before  our cruisers put in an appearance on the spot.  And in the same way our  own officers, by"]]]
