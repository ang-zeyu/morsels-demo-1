Then the mistletoe becomes a precarious  shelter for maids, and the Waits--descendants of the minstrels of  old--go through the snow from door to door, singing their mellow old  carols, while masquerades and the merry Christmas game of Snapdragon are  not forgotten.[D]    [Footnote D: An exhaustive study of the history and customs of Christmas  has been made by W.F. Dawson in \"Christmas and its Associations.\"]    Even the Christmas dinner has its special observances. In many an  English hall the stately custom still survives of bearing in a boar's  head to inaugurate the meal, as a reminder of the student of Queens  College, Oxford, who, attacked by a boar on Christmas day, choked him  with a copy of Aristotle and took his head back for dinner. The mince  pie, sacred to the occasion, is supposed to commemorate in its mixture  of oriental ingredients the offerings made by the wise men of the East.  As for turkey and plum pudding, they have a deep significance, but it is  clearer to the palate than to the brain.    Elise Traut relates the legend that on every Christmas eve the little  Christ-child wanders all over the world bearing on its shoulders a  bundle of evergreens. Through city streets and country lanes, up and  down hill, to proudest castle and lowliest hovel, through cold and storm  and sleet and ice, this holy child travels, to be welcomed or rejected  at the doors at which he pleads for succor. Those who would invite him  and long for his coming set a lighted candle in the window to guide him  on his way hither. They also believe that he comes to them in the guise  of any alms-craving, wandering person who knocks humbly at their doors  for sustenance, thus testing their benevolence. In many places the aid  rendered the beggar is looked upon as hospitality shown to Christ.    This legend embodies the true Christmas spirit which realizes, with a  rush of love to the heart, the divinity in every one of \"the least of  these\" our brethren. Selfishness is rebuked, the feeling of universal  brotherhood is fostered, while the length of this holiday season by  encouraging the reunion of families and of friends, provides a wonderful  rallying place for early affections. A wholesome and joyous current of  religious feeling flows through the entire season to temper its  extravagance and regulate its mirth.    \"Under the sanctions of religion,\" writes Hervey,[E] \"the covenants of  the heart are renewed.... The lovers of Earth seem to have met  together.\"    [Footnote E: For a beautiful and extended discussion of the significance  of the day, see Hervey's \"The Book of Christmas.\"]    Christmas is the birthday of one whose chief contribution to the human  heart and mind was his message of boundless, universal love, He brought  to the world the greatest thing in the world and that is why the season  of his birth has won such an intimate place in our hearts and why its  jubilant bells find this echo there:        \"Ring out the old, ring in the new,        Ring, happy bells, across the snow;        The year is going, let him go;      Ring out the false, ring in the true.        \"Ring out the grief that saps the mind,        For those that here we see no more;        Ring out the feud of rich and poor,      Ring in redress to all mankind.        \"Ring out a slowly dying cause,        And ancient forms of party strife;        Ring in the nobler modes of life,      With sweeter manners, purer laws.        \"Ring out the want, the care, the sin,        The faithless coldness of the times;        Ring out, ring out my mournful rhymes,      But ring the fuller minstrel in.        \"Ring out false pride in place and blood,        The civic slander and the spite;        Ring in the love of truth and right,      Ring in the common love of good.        \"Ring out old shapes of foul disease;        Ring out the narrowing lust of gold;        Ring out the thousand wars of old,      Ring in the thousand years of peace.        \"Ring in the valiant man and free,        The larger heart, the kindlier hand;        Ring out the darkness of the land,      Ring in the Christ that is to be.\"                                       R.H.S.          I    ORIGIN        IS THERE A SANTA CLAUS?    _The following, reprinted from the editorial page of the New York Sun,  was written by the late Mr. Frank P. Church:_      We take pleasure in answering at once and thus prominently the  communication below, expressing at the same time our great gratification  that its faithful author is numbered among the friends of _The Sun_:        Dear Editor: I am 8 years old.      Some of my little friends say there is no Santa Claus.      Papa says \"If you see it in _The Sun_ it's so.\"      Please tell me the truth; is there a Santa Claus?                                                 Virginia O'Hanlon.    Virginia, your little friends are wrong. They have been affected by the  scepticism of a sceptical age. They do not believe except they see. They  think that nothing can be which is not comprehensible by their little  minds. All minds, Virginia, whether they be men's or children's, are  little. In this great universe of ours man is a mere insect, an ant, in  his intellect, as compared with the boundless world about him, as  measured by the intelligence capable of grasping the whole of truth and  knowledge.    Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus. He exists as certainly as love  and generosity and devotion exist, and you know that they abound and  give to your life its highest beauty and joy. Alas! how dreary would be  the world if there were no Santa Claus! It would be as dreary as if  there were no Virginias. There would be no childlike faith then, no  poetry, no romance to make tolerable this existence. We should have no  enjoyment, except in sense and sight. The eternal light with which  childhood fills the world would be extinguished.    Not believe in Santa Claus! You might as well not believe in fairies!  You might get your papa to hire men to watch in all the chimneys on  Christmas Eve to catch Santa Claus, but even if they did not see Santa  Claus coming down, what would that prove? Nobody sees Santa Claus, but  that is no sign that there is no Santa Claus. The most real things in  the world are those that neither children nor men can see. Did you ever  see fairies dancing on the lawn? Of course not, but that's no proof that  they are not there. Nobody can conceive or imagine all the wonders there  are unseen and unseeable in the world.    You may tear apart the baby's rattle and see what makes the noise  inside, but there is a veil covering the unseen world which not the  strongest man, nor even the united strength of all the strongest men  that ever lived, could tear apart. Only faith, fancy, poetry, love,  romance, can push aside that curtain and view and picture the supernal  beauty and glory beyond. Is it all real? Ah, Virginia, in all this world  there is nothing else real and abiding.    No Santa Claus! Thank God! he lives, and he lives forever. A thousand  years from now, Virginia, nay, ten times ten thousand years from now, he  will continue to make glad the heart of childhood.           *       *       *       *       *        O LITTLE TOWN OF BETHLEHEM        PHILLIPS BROOKS        O little town of Bethlehem,        How still we see thee lie!      Above thy deep and dreamless sleep        The silent stars go by;      Yet in thy dark streets shineth        The everlasting Light;      The hopes and fears of all the years        Are met in thee to-night.        For Christ is born of Mary,        And, gathered all above,      While mortals sleep, the angels keep        Their watch of wondering love.      O morning stars, together        Proclaim the holy birth!      And praises sing to God the King,        And peace to men on earth.      How silently, how silently,        The wondrous gift is given!      So God imparts to human hearts        The blessings of His heaven.      No ear may hear His coming,        But in this world of sin,      Where meek souls will receive Him still,        The dear Christ enters in.        O holy Child of Bethlehem!        Descend to us, we pray;      Cast out our sin, and enter in,        Be born in us to-day.      We hear the Christmas angels        The great glad tidings tell;      Oh, come to us, abide with us,        Our Lord Emmanuel!           *       *       *       *       *        THE GLAD EVANGEL        KATE DOUGLAS WIGGIN    When the Child of Nazareth was born, the sun, according to the Bosnian  legend, \"leaped in the heavens, and the stars around it danced. A peace  came over mountain and forest. Even the rotten stump stood straight and  healthy on the green hill-side. The grass was beflowered with open  blossoms, incense sweet as myrrh pervaded upland and forest, birds sang  on the mountain top, and all gave thanks to the great God.\"    It is naught but an old folk-tale, but it has truth hidden at its heart,  for a strange, subtle force, a spirit of genial good-will, a new-born  kindness, seem to animate child and man alike when the world pays its  tribute to the \"heaven-sent youngling,\" as the poet Drummond calls the  infant Christ.    When the Three Wise Men rode from the East into the West on that \"first,  best Christmas night,\" they bore on their saddle-bows three caskets  filled with gold and frankincense and myrrh, to be laid at the feet of  the manger-cradled babe of Bethlehem. Beginning with this old, old  journey, the spirit of giving crept into the world's heart. As the Magi  came bearing gifts, so do we also; gifts that relieve want, gifts that  are sweet and fragrant with friendship, gifts that breathe love, gifts  that mean service, gifts inspired still by the star that shone over the  City of David nearly two thousand years ago.

This arm beneath your head!    It is some dream that on the deck       You've fallen cold and dead.    My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still;  My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse or will;  The ship is anchored safe and sound, its voyage closed and done;  From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;    Exult, O shores! and ring, O bells!        But I, with mournful tread,    Walk the deck my Captain lies,        Fallen, cold and dead.        _Walt Whitman._          A Poet's Prophecy      For I dipt into the future, far as human eye could see,  Saw the Vision of the world, and all the wonder that would be;  Saw the heavens fill with commerce, argosies of magic sails,  Pilots of the purple twilight, dropping down with costly bales;  Heard the heavens fill with shouting, and there rained a ghastly dew  From the nations' airy navies grappling in the central blue;  Far along the world-wide whisper of the south-wind rushing warm,  With the standards of the peoples plunging through the thunderstorm;  Till the war-drum throbb'd no longer, and the battleflags were furl'd  In the Parliament of man, the Federation of the world.  There the common sense of most shall hold a fretful realm in awe,  And the kindly earth shall slumber, lapt in universal law.        _Tennyson, \"Locksley Hall,\" 1842._          The Landing of the Pilgrims      The breaking waves dashed high    On a stern and rock-bound coast,  And the woods against a stormy sky    Their giant branches tossed;    And the heavy night hung dark    The hills and waters o'er,  When a band of exiles moored their bark    On the wild New England shore.    Not as the conqueror comes,    They, the true-hearted, came,--  Not with the roll of the stirring drums,    And the trumpet that sings of fame;    Not as the flying come,    In silence and in fear;  They shook the depths of the desert's gloom    With their hymns of lofty cheer.    Amidst the storms they sang;    And the stars heard, and the sea;  And the sounding aisles of the dim woods rang    To the anthem of the free.    The ocean eagle soared    From his nest by the white wave's foam;  And the rocking pines of the forest roared--    This was their welcome home!    There were men with hoary hair    Amidst that pilgrim band:  Why had they come to wither there    Away from their childhood's land?    There was woman's fearless eye,    Lit by her deep love's truth;  There was manhood's brow serenely high,    And the fiery heart of youth.    What sought they thus afar?    Bright jewels of the mine?  The wealth of seas, the spoils of war?--    They sought a faith's pure shrine.    Ay, call it holy ground,--    The soil where first they trod!  They have left unstained what there they found--    Freedom to worship God!        _Felicia Hemans._          Bobby Shaftoe      \"Marie, will you marry me?  For you know how I love thee!

So many poems thus he learned    That soon he had a store  Of recitations in his head    And still kept learning more.    Now this it is what happened:    He was called upon one week  And totally forgot the piece    He was about to speak.    His brain he vainly cudgeled    But no word was in his head,  And so he spoke at random,    And this is what he said;    My beautiful, my beautiful,    Who standest proudly by,  It was the schooner Hesperus    The breaking waves dashed high.

The Kid Has Gone to the Colors      The Kid has gone to the Colors    And we don't know what to say;  The Kid we have loved and cuddled    Stepped out for the Flag to-day.  We thought him a child, a baby    With never a care at all,  But his country called him man-size    And the Kid has heard the call.    He paused to watch the recruiting,    Where, fired by the fife and drum,  He bowed his head to Old Glory    And thought that it whispered: \"Come!\"  The Kid, not being a slacker,    Stood forth with patriot-joy  To add his name to the roster--    And God, we're proud of the boy!    The Kid has gone to the Colors;    It seems but a little while  Since he drilled a schoolboy army    In a truly martial style,  But now he's a man, a soldier,    And we lend him a listening ear,  For his heart is a heart all loyal,    Unscourged by the curse of fear.    His dad, when he told him, shuddered,    His mother--God bless her!--cried;  Yet, blest with a mother-nature,    She wept with a mother-pride,  But he whose old shoulders straightened    Was Granddad--for memory ran  To years when he, too, a youngster,    Was changed by the Flag to a man!        _W.M. Herschell._          Kentucky Belle      Summer of 'sixty-three, sir, and Conrad was gone away--  Gone to the county-town, sir, to sell our first load of hay--  We lived in the log house yonder, poor as ever you've seen;  Roschen there was a baby, and I was only nineteen.    Conrad, he took the oxen, but he left Kentucky Belle.  How much we thought of Kentuck, I couldn't begin to tell--  Came from the Blue-Grass country; my father gave her to me  When I rode north with Conrad, away from the Tennessee.    Conrad lived in Ohio--a German he is, you know--  The house stood in broad cornfields, stretching on, row after row.  The old folks made me welcome; they were kind as kind could be;  But I kept longing, longing, for the hills of the Tennessee.    Oh, for a sight of water, the shadowed slope of a hill!  Clouds that hang on the summit, a wind that never is still!  But the level land went stretching away to meet the sky--  Never a rise, from north to south, to rest the weary eye!    From east to west, no river to shine out under the moon,  Nothing to make a shadow in the yellow afternoon:  Only the breathless sunshine, as I looked out, all forlorn;  Only the rustle, rustle, as I walked among the corn.    When I fell sick with pining, we didn't wait any more,  But moved away from the cornlands, out to this river shore--  The Tuscarawas it's called, sir--off there's a hill, you see--  And now I've grown to like it next best to the Tennessee.    I was at work that morning. Some one came riding like mad  Over the bridge and up the road--Farmer Rouf's little lad.  Bareback he rode; he had no hat; he hardly stopped to say,  \"Morgan's men are coming, Frau; they're galloping on this way.    \"I'm sent to warn the neighbors. He isn't a mile behind;  He sweeps up all the horses--every horse that he can find.  Morgan, Morgan the raider, and Morgan's terrible men,  With bowie knives and pistols, are galloping up the glen!\"    The lad rode down the valley, and I stood still at the door;  The baby laughed and prattled, playing with spools on the floor;  Kentuck was out in the pasture; Conrad, my man, was gone.  Nearer, nearer, Morgan's men were galloping, galloping on!    Sudden I picked up baby, and ran to the pasture bar.  \"Kentuck!\" I called--\"Kentucky!\" She knew me ever so far!  I led her down the gully that turns off there to the right,  And tied her to the bushes; her head was just out of sight.    As I ran back to the log house, at once there came a sound--  The ring of hoofs, galloping hoofs, trembling over the ground--  Coming into the turnpike out from the White Woman Glen--  Morgan, Morgan the raider, and Morgan's terrible men.    As near they drew and nearer, my heart beat fast in alarm;  But still I stood in the doorway with baby on my arm.  They came, they passed; with spur and whip in haste they sped along--  Morgan, Morgan the raider, and his band, six hundred strong.    Weary they looked and jaded, riding through night and through day;  Pushing on east to the river, many long miles away,  To the border strip where Virginia runs up into the West,  And fording the Upper Ohio before they could stop to rest.    On like the wind they hurried, and Morgan rode in advance;  Bright were his eyes like live coals, as he gave me a sideways"]]]
