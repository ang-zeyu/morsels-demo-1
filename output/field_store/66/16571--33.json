[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19103"],[0,"The Discovery of a World in the Moone (#3)"],[1," for which the poore beast was afterward brought  to the barre to receive a sentence according to his deserts, where the  grave Senate being set to examine the matter, one of the Counsell  (perhaps wiser than the rest) rises up, and out of his deepe judgement,  thinkes it not fit that their Towne should lose its Moone, but that  rather the Asse should be cut up, and that taken out of him, which  sentence being approved by the rest of those Politicians, as the  subtillest way for the conclusion of the matter was accordingly  performed. But whether this tale were true or no I will not question,  however there is absurdity enough in that former custome of the  ancients, that may confirme the truth to be proved, and plainly declare  the insufficiency of common opinion to adde true worth or estimation  unto any thing. So that from that which I have said may be gathered thus  much.      [Sidenote 1: _Turinens. Episc._]    1. That a new truth may seeme absurd and impossible not onely to the     vulgar, but to those also who are otherwise wise men, and excellent     schollers; and hence it will follow, that every new thing which     seemes to oppose common Principles is not presently to be rejected,     but rather to be pry'd into with a diligent enquiry, since there     are many things which are yet hid from us, and reserv'd for future     discovery.    2. That it is not the commonnesse of an opinion that can priviledge it     for a truth, the wrong way is sometime a well beaten path, whereas     the right way (especially to hidden truths) may bee lesse trodden     and more obscure.    True indeed, the strangeness of this opinion will detract much from its  credit; but yet we should know that nothing is in its selfe strange,  since every naturall effect has an equall dependance upon its cause, and  with the like necessity doth follow from it, so that 'tis our ignorance  which makes things appeare so, and hence it comes to passe that many  more evident truths seeme incredible to such who know not the causes of  things: you may as soone perswade some Country peasants that the Moone  is made of greene Cheese (as wee say) as that 'tis bigger than his  Cart-wheele, since both seeme equally to contradict his sight, and hee  has not reason enough to leade him farther than his senses. Nay, suppose  (saith _Plutarch_) a Philosopher should be educated in such a secret  place, where hee might not see either Sea or River, and afterwards  should be brought out where one might shew him the great Ocean telling  him the quality of that water, that it is blackish, salt, and not  potable, and yet there were many vast creatures of all formes living in  it, which make use of the water as wee doe of the aire, questionlesse he  would laugh at all this, as being monstrous lies & fables, without any  colour of truth. Just so will this truth which I now deliver appeare  unto others; because we never dreamt of any such matter as a world in  the Moone, because the state of that place hath as yet been vailed from  our knowledge, therefore wee can scarcely assent to any such matter.  Things are very hardly received which are altogether strange to our  thoughts and our senses. The soule may with lesse difficulty be brought  to believe any absurdity, when as it has formerly beene acquainted with  some colours and probabilities for it, but when a new, and an unheard of  truth shall come before it, though it have good grounds and reasons, yet  the understanding is afraid of it as a stranger, and dares not admit it  into its beliefe without a great deale of reluctancy and tryall. And  besides things that are not manifested to the senses, are not assented  unto without some labour of mind, some travaile and discourse of the  understanding, and many lazie soules had rather quietly repose  themselves in an easie errour, then take paines to search out the truth.  The strangenesse then of this opinion which I now deliver will be a  great hinderance to its beliefe, but this is not to be respected by  reason it cannot bee helped. I have stood the longer in the Preface,  because that prejudice which the meere title of the booke may beget  cannot easily be removed without a great deale of preparation, and I  could not tell otherwise how to rectifie the thoughts of the Reader for  an impartiall survey of the following discourse.    I must needs confesse, though I had often thought with my selfe that it  was possible there might be a world in the Moone, yet it seemed such an  uncouth opinion that I never durst discover it, for feare of being  counted singular and ridiculous, but afterward having read _Plutarch_,  _Galilaeus_, _Keplar_, with some others, and finding many of mine owne  thoughts confirmed by such strong authority, I then concluded that it  was not onely possible there might bee, but probable that there was  another habitable world in that Planet. In the prosecuting of this  assertion, I shall first endeavour to cleare the way from such doubts as  may hinder the speed or ease of farther progresse; and because the  suppositions imply'd in this opinion may seeme to contradict the  principles of reason or faith, it will be requisite that I first remove  this scruple, shewing the conformity of them to both these, and proving  those truths that may make way for the rest, which I shall labour to  performe in the second, third, fourth, and fifth Chapters, and then  proceede to confirme such Propositions, which doe more directly belong  to the maine point in hand.          Proposition 2.    _That a plurality of worlds doth not contradict any principle of    reason or faith._      Tis reported of _Aristotle_ that when hee saw the bookes of _Moses_ he  commended them for such a majesticke stile as might become a God, but  withall hee censured that manner of writing to be very unfitting for a  Philosopher because there was nothing proved in them, but matters were  delivered as if they would rather command than perswade beliefe. And  'tis observed that hee sets downe nothing himselfe, but he confirmes it  by the strongest reasons that may be found, there being scarce an  argument of force for any subject in Philosophy which may not bee picked  out of his writings, and therefore 'tis likely if there were in reason a  necessity of one onely world, that hee would have found out some such  necessary proofe as might confirme it: Especially since hee labours for  it so much in two whole Chapters. But now all the arguments which he  himselfe urges in this subject,[1] are very weake and farre enough from  having in them any convincing power. Therefore 'tis likely that a  plurality of worlds doth not contradict any principle of reason.  However, I will set downe the two chiefe of his arguments from his owne  workes, and from them you may guesse the force of the other. The 1. is  this,[2] since every heavy body doth naturally tend downwards, and every  light body upwards, what a hudling and confusion must there bee if there  were two places for gravity and two places for lightnesse: for it is  probable that the Earth of that other World would fall downe to this  Center, and so mutually the aire and fire here ascend to those Regions  in the other, which must needes much derogate from the providence of  nature, and cause a great disorder in his workes. To this I answere,  that if you will consider the nature of gravity, you will plainely see  there is no ground to feare any such confusion, for heavinesse is  nothing else but such a quality as causes a propension in 'its subject  to tend downewards towards its owne Centre, so that for some of that  earth to come hither would not bee said a fall but an ascension, since  it moved from its owne place, and this would bee impossible (saith  _Ruvio_) because against nature,[3] and therefore no more to bee feared  than the falling of the Heavens.      [Sidenote 1: _De Coelo_ l. 1. c. 8. 9.]      [Sidenote 2: _Ibid._]      [Sidenote 3: _De Coelo_ l. 1. c. 9. q. 1.]    Another Argument hee had from his master _Plato_,[1] that there is but  one World, because there is but one first mover, God.[2]      [Sidenote 1: _Metaphys._ l. 12. c. 8.]      [Sidenote 2: _Diog. Laert. lib._ 3.]    But here I may deny the consequence, since a plurality of worlds doth  not take away the unity of the first mover.      _Vt enim forma substantialis, sic primum efficiens apparentem    solummodo multiplicitatem induit per signatam materiam_    (saith a Countreyman of ours.)[1] As the substantiall forme, so the  efficient cause hath onely an appearing multiplicity from its particular  matter. You may see this point more largely handled, and these Arguments  more fully answered by _Plutarch_ in his Booke (why Oracles are silent)  and _Iacob Carpentarius_ in his comment on _Alcinous_.      [Sidenote 1: _Nic. Hill. de Philosop. Epic. partic. 379._]    But our opposites the Interpreters themselves, (who too often doe  _jurare in verba magistri_) will grant that there is not any strength in  these consequences, and certainely their such weake arguments could not  convince that wise Philosopher, who in his other opinions was wont to  bee swayed by the strength and power of reason: wherefore I should  rather thinke that he had some by-respect, which made him first assent  to this opinion, and afterwards strive to prove it. Perhaps it was  because hee feared to displease his scholler _Alexander_, of whom 'tis  related[1] that he wept to heare a disputation of another world, since  he had not then attained the Monarchy of this, his restlesse wide heart  would have esteemed this Globe of Earth not big enough for him, if there  had beene another, which made the Satyrist say of him,      _AEstuat infoelix angusto limite mundi._[2]      \"That he did vexe himselfe and sweate in his desires, as being pend    up in a narrow roome, when hee was confin'd but to one world.\"    Before he thought to seate himselfe next the Gods, but now when hee had  done his best, hee"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19106"],[0,"Reconocimiento del fuerte del Carmen del Rio Negro (#3)"],[1," las provincias del Perú, del año de 1780.    --Discurso preliminar del editor.    39.--Coleccion de viages y expediciones á los campos de Buenos Aires, y        á la costa de Patagonia.    --Discurso preliminar del editor.    40.--Extracto, ó resumen del diario del Padre José Cardiel, de su viage        desde Buenos Aires hasta el Vulcan, y de este, siguiendo la Costa        Patagónica, hasta el Arroyo de la Ascencion.    41.--Viage que hizo el San Martin, desde Buenos Aires hasta el puerto de        San Julian en 1752; y relacion de un indio Paraguayo, que desde        dicho puerto volvió por tierra hasta Buenos Aires.    42.--Observaciones extractadas de los viages que en diferentes años han        ejecutado al Estrecho de Magallanes los Almirantes y Capitanes,        Olivares de Noort, Simon de Cordes, Jorge Spilberg, Francisco        Drake, Juan Childey, Tomas Candish, Juan Narborough, con otras        noticias adquiridas en las expediciones egecutadas por los        Franceses desde las Islas Maluinas, en la fragata Aguila.    43.--Diario del Capitan D.
