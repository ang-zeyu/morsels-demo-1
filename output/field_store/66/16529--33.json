[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18444"],[0,"The Story of the Hymns and Tunes (#3)"],[1,"the  formula of the \"Te Deum\" were already familiar in the Christian church.  But it is generally believed that the tongue of Ambrose gave the anthem  its final form.    [Footnote 2: [Greek: Peri tou thnetou], \"On the Mortality.\"]    Ambrose was born in Gaul about the middle of the fourth century and  raised to his bishopric in A.D. 374. Very early he saw and appreciated  the popular effect of musical sounds, and what an evangelical instrument  a chorus of chanting voices could be in preaching the Christian faith;  and he introduced the responsive singing of psalms and sacred cantos in  the worship of the church. \"A grand thing is that singing, and nothing  can stand before it,\" he said, when the critics of his time complained  that his innovation was sensational. That such a charge could be made  against the Ambrosian mode of music, with its slow movement and  unmetrical lines, seems strange to us, but it was _new_--and  conservatism is the same in all ages.    The great bishop carried all before him. His school of song-worship  prevailed in Christian Europe more than two hundred years. Most of his  hymns are lost, (the Benedictine writers credit him with twelve), but,  judging by their effect on the powerful mind of Augustine, their  influence among the common people must have been profound, and far more  lasting than the author's life. \"Their voices sank into mine ears, and  their truths distilled into my heart,\" wrote Augustine, long afterwards,  of these hymns; \"tears ran down, and I rejoiced in them.\"    Poetic tradition has dramatized the story of the birth of the \"Te Deum,\"  dating it on an Easter Sunday, and dividing the honor of its composition  between Ambrose and his most eminent convert. It was the day when the  bishop baptized Augustine, in the presence of a vast throng that crowded  the Basilica of Milan. As if foreseeing with a prophet's eye that his  brilliant candidate would become one of the ruling stars of Christendom,  Ambrose lifted his hands to heaven and chanted in a holy rapture,--        We praise Thee, O God! We acknowledge Thee to be the Lord;      All the Earth doth worship Thee, the Father Everlasting.    He paused, and from the lips of the baptized disciple came the  response,--        To Thee all the angels cry aloud: the heavens and all the powers          therein.      To Thee cherubim and seraphim continually do cry,     \"Holy, holy, holy Lord God of Sabaoth;      Heaven and Earth are full of the majesty of Thy glory!\"    and so, stave by stave, in alternating strains, sprang that day from the  inspired lips of Ambrose and Augustine the \"Te Deum Laudamus,\" which has  ever since been the standard anthem of Christian praise.    Whatever the foundation of the story, we may at least suppose the first  public singing[3] of the great chant to have been associated with that  eventful baptism.    [Footnote 3: The \"Te Deum\" was first sung _in English_ by the martyr,  Bishop Ridley, at Hearne Church, where he was at one time vicar.]    The various anthems, sentences and motets in all Christian languages  bearing the titles \"Trisagion\" or \"Tersanctus,\" and \"Te Deum\" are taken  from portions of this royal hymn. The sublime and beautiful \"Holy, Holy,  Holy\" of Bishop Heber was suggested by it.      _THE TUNE._    No echo remains, so far as is known, of the responsive chant actually  sung by Ambrose, but one of the best modern choral renderings of the \"Te  Deum\" is the one by Henry Smart in his _Morning and Evening Service_. In  an ordinary church hymnal it occupies seven pages. The staff-directions  with the music indicate the part or cue of the antiphonal singers by the  words Decani (Dec.) and Cantor (Can.), meaning first the division of the  choir on the Dean's side, and second the division on the Cantor's or  Precentor's side.    Henry Smart was one of the five great English composers that followed  our American Mason. He was born in London, Oct. 25, 1812, and chose  music for a profession in preference to an offered commission in the  East Indian army. His talent as a composer, especially of sacred music,  was marvellous, and, though he became blind, his loss of sight was no  more hindrance to his genius than loss of hearing to Beethoven.    No composer of his time equalled Henry Smart as a writer of music for  female voices. His cantatas have been greatly admired, and his hymn  tunes are unsurpassed for their purity and sweetness, while his anthems,  his oratorio of \"Jacob,\" and indeed all that he wrote, show the hand and  the inventive gift of a great musical artist.    He died July 10, 1879, universally mourned for his inspired work, and  his amiable character.      \"ALL GLORY, LAUD AND HONOR.\"  _Gloria, Laus et Honor._    This stately Latin hymn of the early part of the 9th century was  composed in A.D. 820, by Theodulph, Bishop of Orleans, while a captive  in the cloister of Anjou. King Louis (le Debonnaire) son of Charlemagne,  had trouble with his royal relatives, and suspecting Theodulph to be in  sympathy with them, shut him up in prison. A pretty story told by  Clichtovius, an old church writer of A.D. 1518, relates how on Palm  Sunday the king, celebrating the feast with his people, passed in  procession before the cloister, where the face of the venerable prisoner  at his cell window caused an involuntary halt, and, in the moment of  silence, the bishop raised his voice and sang this hymn; and how the  delighted king released the singer, and restored him to his bishopric.  This tale, told after seven hundred years, is not the only legend that  grew around the hymn and its author, but the fact that he composed it in  the cloister of Anjou while confined there is not seriously disputed.        Gloria, laus et honor Tibi sit, Rex Christe Redemptor,      Cui puerile decus prompsit Hosanna pium.      Israel Tu Rex, Davidis et inclyta proles,      Nomine qui in Domini Rex benedicte venis                                 Gloria, laus et honor.    Theodulph was born in Spain, but of Gothic pedigree, a child of the race  of conquerors who, in the 5th century, overran Southern Europe. He died  in 821, but whether a free man or still a prisoner at the time of his  death is uncertain. Some accounts allege that he was poisoned in the  cloister. The Roman church canonized him, and his hymn is still sung as  a processional in Protestant as well as Catholic churches. The above  Latin lines are the first four of the original seventy-eight. The  following is J.M. Neale's translation of the portion now in use:        All glory, laud, and honor,        To Thee, Redeemer, King:      To whom the lips of children        Made sweet Hosannas ring.        Thou are the King of Israel,        Thou David's royal Son,      Who in the Lord's name comest,        The King and Blessed One.    All glory, etc.        The company of angels        Are praising Thee on high;      And mortal men, and all things        Created, make reply.         All glory, etc.        The people of the Hebrews        With palms before Thee went;      Our praise and prayer and anthems        Before Thee we present.      All glory, etc.        To Thee before Thy Passion        They sang their hymns of praise;      To Thee, now high exalted        Our melody we raise.         All glory, etc.        Thou didst accept their praises;        Accept the prayers we bring,      Who in all good delightest,        Thou good and gracious King. All glory, etc.    The translator, Rev. John Mason Neale, D.D., was born in London, Jan.  24, 1818, and graduated at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1840. He was a  prolific writer, and after taking holy orders he held the office of  Warden of Sackville College, East Grimstead, Sussex. Best known among  his published works are _Mediaeval Hymns and Sequences_, _Hymns for  Children_, _Hymns of the Eastern Church_ and _The Rhythms of Morlaix_.  He died Aug. 6, 1866.      _THE TUNE._    There is no certainty as to the original tune of Theodulph's Hymn, or  how long it survived, but various modern composers have given it music  in more or less keeping with its character, notably Melchior Teschner,  whose harmony, \"St. Theodulph,\" appears in the new _Methodist Hymnal_.  It well represents the march of the bishop's Latin.    Melchior Teschner, a Prussian musician, was Precentor at Frauenstadt,  Silesia, about 1613.      \"ALL PRAISE TO THEE, ETERNAL LORD.\"  _Gelobet Seist du Jesu Christ._    This introductory hymn of worship, a favorite Christmas hymn in Germany,  is ancient, and appears to be a versification of a Latin prose  \"Sequence\" variously ascribed to a 9th century author, and to Gregory  the Great in the 6th century. Its German form is still credited to  Luther in most hymnals. Julian gives an earlier German form (1370) of  the \"Gelobet,\" but attributes all but the first stanza to Luther, as the  hymn now stands. The following translation, printed first in the  _Sabbath Hymn Book_, Andover, 1858, is the one adopted by Schaff in his  _Christ in Song_:        All praise to Thee, eternal Lord,      Clothed in the garb of flesh and blood;      Choosing a manger for Thy throne,      While worlds on worlds are Thine alone!        Once did the skies before Thee bow;      A virgin's arms contain Thee now;      Angels, who did in Thee rejoice,      Now listen for Thine infant voice.        A little child, Thou art our guest,      That weary ones in Thee may rest;      Forlorn and lowly in Thy birth,      That we may rise to heaven from earth.        Thou comest in the darksome night,      To make us children of the light;      To make us, in the realms divine,      Like Thine own angels round Thee shine.        All this for us Thy love hath done:      By this to Thee our love is won;      For this we tune our cheerful lays,      And shout our thanks in endless praise.      _THE TUNE._    The 18th century tune of \"Weimar\" (_Evangelical Hymnal_), by Emanuel  Bach, suits the spiritual tone of the hymn, and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18445"],[0,"Bohemians of the Latin Quarter (#3)"],[1,"the least curious. They find in Bohemian life an  existence full of seductions, not to dine every day, to sleep in the  open air on wet nights, and to dress in nankeen in the month of December  seems to them the paradise of human felicity, and to enter it some  abandon the family home, and others the study which leads to an assured  result. They suddenly turn their backs upon an honorable future to seek  the adventure of a hazardous career. But as the most robust cannot stand  a mode of living that would render Hercules consumptive, they soon give  up the game, and, hastening back to the paternal roast joint, marry  their little cousins, set up as a notary in a town of thirty thousand  inhabitants, and by their fireside of an evening have the satisfaction  of relating their artistic misery with the magniloquence of a traveller  narrating a tiger hunt. Others persist and put their self-esteem in it,  but when once they have exhausted those resources of credit which a  young fellow with well-to-do relatives can always find, they are more  wretched than the real Bohemians, who, never having had any other  resources, have at least those of intelligence. We knew one of these  amateur Bohemians who, after having remained three years in Bohemia and  quarrelled with his family, died one morning, and was taken to the  common grave in a pauper's hearse. He had ten thousand francs a year.    It is needless to say that these Bohemians have nothing whatever in  common with art, and that they are the most obscure amongst the least  known of ignored Bohemia.    We now come to the real Bohemia, to that which forms, in part, the  subject of this book. Those who compose it are really amongst those  called by art, and have the chance of being also amongst its elect. This  Bohemia, like the others, bristles with perils, two abysses flank it on  either side--poverty and doubt. But between these two gulfs there is at  least a road leading to a goal which the Bohemians can see with their  eyes, pending the time when they shall touch it with their hand.    It is official Bohemia so-called because those who form part of it have  publicly proved their existence, have signalised their presence in the  world elsewhere than on a census list, have, to employ one of their own  expressions, \"their name in the bill,\" who are known in the literary and  artistic market, and whose products, bearing their stamp, are current  there, at moderate rates it is true.    To arrive at their goal, which is a settled one, all roads serve, and  the Bohemians know how to profit by even the accidents of the route.  Rain or dust, cloud or sunshine, nothing checks these bold adventurers,  whose sins are backed by virtue. Their mind is kept ever on the alert by  their ambition, which sounds a charge in front and urges them to the  assault of the future; incessantly at war with necessity, their  invention always marching with lighted match blows up the obstacle  almost before it incommodes them. Their daily existence is a work of  genius, a daily problem which they always succeed in solving by the aid  of audacious mathematics. They would have forced Harpagon to lend them  money, and have found truffles on the raft of the \"Medusa.\" At need,  too, they know how to practice abstinence with all the virtue of an  anchorite, but if a slice of fortune falls into their hands you will see  them at once mounted on the most ruinous fancies, loving the youngest  and prettiest, drinking the oldest and best, and never finding  sufficient windows to throw their money out of. Then, when their last  crown is dead and buried, they begin to dine again at that table spread  by chance, at which their place is always laid, and, preceded by a pack  of tricks, go poaching on all the callings that have any connection with  art, hunting from morn till night that wild beast called a five-franc  piece.    The Bohemians know everything and go everywhere, according as they have  patent leather pumps or burst boots. They are to be met one day leaning  against the mantel-shelf in a fashionable drawing room, and the next  seated in the arbor of some suburban dancing place. They cannot take ten  steps on the Boulevard without meeting a friend, and thirty, no matter  where, without encountering a creditor.    Bohemians speak amongst themselves a special language borrowed from the  conversation of the studios, the jargon of behind the scenes, and the  discussions of the editor's room. All the eclecticisms of style are met  with in this unheard of idiom, in which apocalyptic phrases jostle cock  and bull stories, in which the rusticity of a popular saying is wedded  to extravagant periods from the same mold in which Cyrano de Bergerac  cast his tirades; in which the paradox, that spoilt child of modern  literature, treats reason as the pantaloon is treated in a pantomime; in  which irony has the intensity of the strongest acids and the skill of  those marksmen who can hit the bull's-eye blindfold; a slang  intelligent, though unintelligible to those who have not its key, and  the audacity of which surpasses that of the freest tongues. This  Bohemian vocabulary is the hell of rhetoric and the paradise of  neologism.    Such is in brief that Bohemian life, badly known to the puritans of  society, decried by the puritans of art, insulted by all the timorous  and jealous mediocrities who cannot find enough of outcries, lies, and  calumnies to drown the voices and the names of those who arrive through  the vestibule to renown by harnessing audacity to their talent.    A life of patience, of courage, in which one cannot fight unless clad in  a strong armour of indifference impervious to the attacks of fools and  the envious, in which one must not, if one would not stumble on the  road, quit for a single moment that pride in oneself which serves as a  leaning staff; a charming and a terrible life, which has conquerors and  its martyrs, and on which one should not enter save in resigning oneself  in advance to submit to the pitiless law _vae victis_.    H. M.          CHAPTER I    HOW THE BOHEMIAN CLUB WAS FORMED      One morning--it was the eighth of April--Alexander Schaunard, who  cultivated the two liberal arts of painting and music, was rudely  awakened by the peal of a neighbouring cock, which served him for an  alarm.    \"By Jove!\" exclaimed Schaunard, \"my feathered clock goes too fast: it  cannot possibly be today yet!\" So saying, he leaped precipitately out of  a piece of furniture of his own ingenious contrivance, which, sustaining  the part of bed by night, (sustaining it badly enough too,) did duty by  day for all the rest of the furniture which was absent by reason of the  severe cold for which the past winter had been noted.    To protect himself against the biting north-wind, Schaunard slipped on  in haste a pink satin petticoat with spangled stars, which served him  for dressing-gown. This gay garment had been left at the artist's  lodging, one masked-ball night, by a _folie_, who was fool enough to let  herself be entrapped by the deceitful promises of Schaunard when,  disguised as a marquis, he rattled in his pocket a seducingly sonorous  dozen of crowns--theatrical money punched out of a lead plate and  borrowed of a property-man. Having thus made his home toilette, the  artist proceeded to open his blind and window. A solar ray, like an  arrow of light, flashed suddenly into the room, and compelled him to  open his eyes that were still veiled by the mists of sleep. At the same  moment the clock of a neighbouring church struck five.    \"It is the Morn herself!\" muttered Schaunard; \"astonishing, but\"--and he  consulted an almanac nailed to the wall--\"not the less a mistake. The  results of science affirm that at this season of the year the sun ought  not to rise till half-past five: it is only five o'clock, and there he  is! A culpable excess of zeal! The luminary is wrong; I shall have to  make a complaint to the longitude-office. However, I must begin to be a  little anxious. Today is the day after yesterday, certainly; and since  yesterday was the seventh, unless old Saturn goes backward, it must be  the eighth of April today. And if I may believe this paper,\" continued  Schaunard, going to read an official notice-to-quit posted on the wall,  \"today, therefore, at twelve precisely, I ought to have evacuated the  premises, and paid into the hands of my landlord, Monsieur Bernard, the  sum of seventy-five francs for three quarters' rent due, which he  demands of me in very bad handwriting. I had hoped--as I always do--that  Providence would take the responsibility of discharging this debt, but  it seems it hasn't had time. Well, I have six hours before me yet. By  making good use of them, perhaps--to work! to work!\"    He was preparing to put on an overcoat, originally of a long-haired,  woolly fabric, but now completely bald from age, when suddenly, as if  bitten by a tarantula, he began to execute around the room a polka of  his own composition, which at the public balls had often caused him to  be honoured with the particular attention of the police.    \"By Jove!\" he exclaimed, \"it is surprising how the morning air gives one  ideas! It strikes me that I am on the scent of my air; Let's see.\" And,  half-dressed as he was, Schaunard seated himself at his piano. After  having waked the sleeping instrument by a terrific hurly-burly of notes,  he began, talking to himself all the while, to hunt over the keys for  the tune he had long been seeking.    \"Do, sol, mi, do la, si, do re. Bah! it's as false as Judas, that re!\"  and he struck violently on the doubtful note. \"We must represent  adroitly the grief of a young person picking to pieces a white daisy  over a blue lake. There's an idea that's not in its infancy! However,  since it is fashion, and you couldn't find a music publisher who would  dare to publish a ballad without a blue lake in it, we must go with the  fashion. Do, sol,"]]]
