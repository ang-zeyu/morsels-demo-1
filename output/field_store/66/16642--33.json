[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19962"],[0,"Piccaninnies (#3)"],[1,"ld.\"]    The Piccaninnies love to play with them; indeed, they're favourites with  everyone, and it's the prettiest sight in the world at early morning, to  see each Bush Baby crawling out of its cradle flower on its little  tummy, yawning or smiling or stretching, or blinking at the light with  round sleepy eyes.    But you would never get up early enough to see that.    They tell a story in the Bush about a Bush Baby and a Piccaninny--and  laugh about it to this day. The Piccaninny told the Bush Baby that he  would find some honey for her. Now the Bush Babies love honey better  than anything else in the world, so she put her hand in his sweetly and  off they set.    They came to the edge of the swamp where the tall branching flax flowers  grow (the flax is not in flower when the kowhai is, but I can't spoil my  story for that), and every flax flower was alive with birds, dipping,  and sipping the honey, so the two little creatures wandered off again.    The Piccaninny led the Bush Baby to several other flowers, but at every  one some bird or insect would edge them away, crying out:    \"We got here first!\"    [Illustration: \"The Bush Lawyer, the most spiteful plant in the bush.\"]    At last the Bush Baby began to cry. They are very young and tender  things, these Babies, and this one had been caught and scratched by the  Bush Lawyer, the most spiteful plant in the Bush, and had nearly fallen  into a creek, and the peak of its cap was dangling into its eye, and it  was a long way from home.    To comfort it the Piccaninny put his little brown arms right round it  and loved it, and they both sat down on a fallen tree to rest while he  wiped its eyes with a soft green leaf--they didn't know about pocket  handkerchiefs yet.    _Oh!_ The next moment out of a hole in the tree flew a swarm of angry  bees, with humming wings and large fierce eyes and tails curved down to  strike.    The Bush Baby was so astonished that she fell off the log, and there she  lay face down on the green moss, so still that the bees took her for a  fallen kowhai blossom and droned away from her.    But the Piccaninny ran for his life, with all the bees after him, and  when the noise of their angry buzzing had died away, the Bush Baby got  up and had a rare feast of honey, and went back home very sticky and  blissful and contented.    As for the Piccaninny, who had escaped the bees, by lying down and  pretending to be a Tea Tree Jack (they call that camouflage now), he  only sniffed when they told him about it, and said:    \"Pooh! I knew that honey was there all the time. I said I'd find her  some and I did!\"    _How like a boy!_     _When the tree of gold    Turns a tree of green,    The dear Bush Babies    Are no more seen.    To fields of gold    They have gaily run,    And are lost in the light    Of the golden sun;    Or caught in the mist    Of gold that lies    Like a net of dreams    On Day's sleepy eyes.    But behold! next year    They are here! They are here!    They come trooping back    Down the wander-track,    Like rays of light    In the forest old,    And the green tree turns    To a tree of gold._          HOHERIA BLOSSOM.      Do you know the Lovely Ladies of the Bush? They swing on  the tips of the Hoheria tree, with their floating white gowns and  tossing silvery ringlets, and are so light and graceful that they float  on the wind as they swing. If you could _only_ see the Lovely Ladies  dancing! But very few have been lucky enough for that!    They dance on the wind, holding to the tips of the Hoheria and their  white gowns flutter and swirl, and their ringlets float and sway, and  sometimes in the joy of the dance a Lovely Lady lets go of her branch  and comes fluttering down to earth.    Then she can dance no more, but lies very still. It is rather sad,  because once she has let go she may not go back and dance on the tree  for a whole long year, and it is looked on rather as a disgrace to be  the first to fall.    However, she has not to wait long for company. For one by one, the  Lovely Ladies, wild with the joy of the mazy dance, the soft rush of  the wind and the laughing and clapping of the little leaves, loose their  hold, and drift to earth light as thistle-down, and that is the end of  their dancing for that year. Where do they go to while the year goes by?  I have never found out, but I think it most likely that they go to the  place they came from.    The Lovely Ladies have a song which they and the wind sing together as  they dance, and the way it is sung makes everyone that hears it, mad to  dance too. This is it:      \"_The wind is shaking the Hoheria tree,          Cling, Maidens, cling!\"    \"I'll dance with you if you'll dance with me,          Swing, Maidens, swing!\"    \"So up with a windy rush we go,    Floating, fluttering, to and fro,\"    \"Sing for the joy of it, Maidens, Oh!          Sing, Maidens, sing!_\"    The Piccaninnies simply love to watch the Lovely Ladies dancing, and  long to be able to dance in the same way. When they hear the song, their  little brown toes go fidgeting among the moss and leaves, and their  heads nod-nodding to the air.    [Illustration: \"They dance on the wind.\"]    [Illustration: \"They began working themselves up and down like mad.\"]    Once they found a Hoheria tree after all the Lovely Ladies had left it,  and now, they thought, was their chance. They swarmed all over the tree,  clutched the tips of the delicate branches, and began working themselves  up and down like mad.    It was great fun, but with their chubby little brown bodies, short legs,  and shock heads, it did not look quite the same thing, and three Bush  Babies riding that way on a good-natured kiwi, laughed so much (and even  the kiwi, which is a grave bird, looked up and smiled) that the  Piccaninnies, feeling rather foolish, dropped to the the ground and ran  away and hid in the fern.          THE GREAT RED ENEMY.      One day one of those tiresome picnic parties came again  to the bush, and after a great deal of stupid and rather terrifying  noise, during which every Piccaninny and Bush Baby and all the other  bush folk lay hidden away in utter silence, the people all went away  again, and the Wee Folk were free to come out of their hiding places and  turn over curiously the few things the party had left.    There was an empty meat tin which flashed so brightly that the  Piccaninnies took it for a helmet, and each in turn tried to wear it;  but it was so big that it simply hid them altogether, so very  regretfully they had to throw it away. Then there were a few crusts of  bread which quite by accident one of the boys discovered to be good to  eat. They finished every crumb of the bread and enjoyed it, but on the  whole agreed that fern root tasted nicer. There was an empty bottle  that nobody dared go near, for they thought it was some kind of gun, and  a baby's woollen bootee, which the Piccaninnies found most useful as an  enormous bag to be filled with berries. But most mysterious, and  therefore most interesting, though a little frightening, was a large  heap of grey smoking ashes where the picnic fire had been.    The Piccaninnies circled round and round this queer grey pile wondering  what on earth it could be. One boy venturing a little nearer than the  others trod on a live cinder, for the fire was not as dead as it ought  to have been, and jumped back howling and hopping round and round on one  foot, holding the other.    When they crowded round him asking what had happened he cried in fear:    \"The Red Enemy bit me. He lives under that grey mound, and I saw his red  eye flash as I went near. That is his breath you see rising up through  the trees.\"    The Piccaninnies looked frightened and backed away from the grey mound,  but all the rest of that evening they came again and again to stare upon  the Red Enemy, and each time they came his red eyes seemed to flash  brighter, his thick white breath to grow denser as it wound up through  the trees, and he seemed to be purring and growling to himself.    [Illustration: \"All the rest of the evening they came again and again to  stare upon the Red Enemy.\"]    When the Piccaninnies went to bed that night they were very uneasy and  could not sleep well. The sound of the Red Enemy's breathing seemed to  fill the bush with a low roaring, and his breath stole in and out of the  trees like a reddish mist; the air was very hot and dry. One of the  Piccaninnies, a brave little fellow, said that he would go and see what  their strange new enemy was doing, and sliding down his sleeping-tree he  set off.    He had not gone far before the heat and the stifling air drove him hack,  and rushing back to his friends he cried:    \"Run for your lives! Quick! Quick! The Great Red Enemy is coming. He is  roaring with anger and tearing the trees down as he comes. None of us  can hope to escape him, for he has a million bright red eyes which he  sends flying through the bush in all directions to find us, and his  breath is so thick that we will be lost in it if we don't run now. Run!  Run!\"    The Piccaninnies did not wait to be told twice. Without waiting to pack  up they slid down the trees and started to run through the dark bush,  and soon there were hundreds of little bush creatures all joining in the  race for life.    On, on they ran in fear and excitement, hearing the angry roaring of the  Great Red Enemy behind them, feeling his hot breath scorching them as it  writhed and twisted through the trees in reddish-black billows. Some of  his millions of angry, red searching eyes flew or drifted past them, but  they never stopped for a moment. And now they had left the trees behind  them and were running over clear ground, and before long they reached  the edge of the swamp, lying dark and cool before them.    In their haste and fear they all plunged in headlong and found the water  so fresh and cool and delightful after their heat and hurry, that they"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1997"],[0,"The Divine Comedy, Volume 3, Paradise (#3)"],[1,"various differences, dispose the  distinctions which they have within themselves unto their ends  and their seeds.[4] These organs of the world thus proceed, as  thou now seest, from grade to grade; for they receivefrom above,  and operate below.

The motion and the virtue of  the holy spheres must needs be inspired by blessed motors, as the  work of the hammer by the smith. And the heaven, which so many  lights make beautiful, takes its image from the deep Mind which  revolves it, and makes thereof a seal. And as the soul within  your dust is diffused through different members, and conformed to  divers potencies, so the Intelligence[5] displays its own  goodness multiplied through the stars, itself circling upon its  own unity. Divers virtue makes divers alloy with the precious  body that it quickens, in which, even as life in you, it is  bound. Because of the glad nature whence, it flows, the virtue  mingled through the body shines,[6] as gladness through the  living pupil.

The Heaven of the Moon.--Spirits whose vows had been  broken.--Piccarda Donati.--The Empress Constance.    That sun which first had heated my breast with love, proving and  refuting, had uncovered to me the sweet aspect of fair truth; and  I, in order to confess myself corrected and assured so far as was  needful, raised my head more erect to speak. But a vision  appeared which held me to itself so close in order to be seen,  that of my confession I remembered not.    As through transparent and polished glasses, or through clear and  tranquil waters, not so deep that their bed be lost, the  lineaments of our faces return so feebly that a pearl on a white  brow comes not less readily to our eyes, so I saw many faces  eager to speak; wherefore I ran into the error contrary to that  which kindled love between the man and the fountain.[1] Suddenly,  even as I became aware of them, supposing them mirrored  semblances, I turned my eyes to see of whom they were; and I saw  nothing; and I turned them forward again, straight into the light  of the sweet guide who, smiling, was glowing in her holy eyes.  \"Wonder not because I smile,\" she said to me, \"at thy puerile  thought, since thy foot trusts itself not yet upon the truth, but  turns thee, as it is wont, to emptiness. True substances are  these which thou seest, here relegated through failure in their  vows. Therefore speak with them, and hear, and believe; for the  veracious light which satisfies them allows them not to turn  their feet from itself.\"    [1] Narcissus conceived the image to be a true face; Dante takes  the real faces to be mirrored semblances.      And I directed me to the shade that seemed most eager to speak,  and I began, even like a man whom too strong wish confuses, \"O  well-created spirit, who in the rays of life eternal tastest the  sweetness, which untasted never is understood, it will be  gracious to me, if thou contentest me with thy name, and with  your destiny.\" Whereon she promptly, and with smiling eyes, \"Our  charity locks not its door to a just wish, more than that which  wills that all its court be like itself. I was in the world a  virgin sister,[1] and if thy mind well regards, my being more  beautiful will not conceal me from thee; but thou wilt recognize  that I am Piccarda,[2] who, placed here with these other blessed  Ones, am blessed in the slowest sphere. Our affections, which are  inflamed only in the pleasure of the Holy Spirit, rejoice in  being formed according to His order;[3] and this allotment, which  appears so low, is forsooth given to us, because our vows  were neglected or void in some part.\" Whereon I to her, In your  marvellous aspects there shines I know not what divine which  transmutes you from our first conceptions; therefore I was not  swift in remembering; but now that which you say to  me assists me, so that refiguring is plainer to me. But tell  me, ye who are happy here, do ye desire a highher place, in  order to see more, or to make yourselves more friends?\"  With those other shades she first smiled a little; then  answered me so glad, that she seemed to burn in the first  fire of love, \"Brother, virtue of charity[4] quiets our will,  and makes us wish only for that which we have, and for  aught else makes us not thirsty. Should we desire to be  higher up, our desires would be discordant with the will of  Him who assigns us to this place, which thou wilt see is  not possible in these circles, if to be in charity is here  necesse,[5] and if its nature thou dost well consider. Nay, it is  essential to this blessed existence to hold ourselves within the  divine will, whereby our very wills are made one. So that as we  are, from stage to stage throughout this realm, to all the realm  is pleasing, as to the King who inwills us with His will. And His  will is our peace; it is that sea whereunto is moving all that  which It creates and which nature makes.\"    [1] A nun, of the order of St. Clare.    [2] The sister of Corso Donati and of Forese: see Purgatory,  Canto XXIII. It may not be without intention that the first  blessed spirit whom Dante sees in Paradise is a relative of his  own wife, Gemma dei Donati.    [3] Rejoice in whatever grade of bliss is assigned to thern in  that order of the universe which is the form that makes it like  unto God.    [4] Charity here means love, the love of God.    [5] Of necessity; the Latin word being used for the  rhyme's sake. \"Mansionem Deus haber non potest ubi  charitas non est\" B. Alberti Magni, De adhoerendo Deo, c.  xii.      Clear was it then to me, how everywhere in Heaven is Paradise,  although the grace of the Supreme Good rains not there in one  measure.    But even as it happen, if one food sates, and for another the  appetite still remains, that this is asked for, and that declined  with thanks; so did I, with gesture and with speech, to learn  from her, what was the web whereof she did not draw the shuttle  to the head.[1] \"Perfect life and high merit in-heaven a lady  higher up,\" she said to me, \"according to whose rule, in your  world below, there are who vest and veil themselves, so that till  death they may wake and sleep with that Spouse who accepts every  vow which love conforms unto His pleasure. A young girl, I fled  from the world to follow her, and in her garb I shut myself, and  pledged me to the pathway of her order. Afterward men, more used  to ill than good, dragged me forth from the sweet cloister;[2]  and God knows what then my life became. And this other splendor,  which shows itself to thee at my right side, and which glows with  all the light of our sphere, that which I say of me understands  of herself.[3] A sister was she; and in like manner from her head  the shadow of the sacred veils was taken. But after she too was  returned unto the world against her liking and against good  usage, from the veil of the heart she was never unbound.[4] This  is the light of the great Constance,[5] who from the second  wind of Swabia produced the third and the last power.\"    [1] To learn from her what was the vow which she did not  fulfil.    [2] According to the old commentators, her brother Corso forced  Piccarda by violence to leave the convent, in order to make a  marriage which he desired for her.    [3] Her experience was similar to that of Piccarda.    [4] She remained a nun at heart.    [5] Constance, daughter of the king of Sicily, Roger 1.; married,  in 1186, to the Emperor, Henry VI., the son of Frederick  Barbarossa, and father of Frederick II, who died in 1250, the  last Emperor of his line.      Thus she spoke to me, and then began singing \"Ave Maria,\" and  Singing vanished, like a heavy thing through deep water. My  sight, that followed her so far as was possible, after it lost  her turned to the mark of greater desire, and wholly rendered  itself to Beatrice; but she so flashed upon my gaze that at first  the sight endured it not: and this made me more slow in  questioning.        CANTO IV. Doubts of Dante, respecting the justice of Heaven and  the abode of the blessed, solved by Beatrice.--Question of Dante  as to the possibility of reparation for broken vows.    Between two viands, distant and attractive in like measure, a  free man would die of hunger, before he would bring one of them  to his teeth. Thus a lamb would stand between two ravenings of  fierce wolves, fearing equally; thus would stand a dog between  two does. Hence if, urged by my doubts in like measure, I was  silent, I blame not myself; nor, since it was necessary, do I  commend.    I was silent, but my desire was depicted on my face, and the  questioning with that far more fervent than by distinct speech.  Beatrice did what Daniel did, delivering Nebuchadnezzar from  anger, which had made him unjustly cruel, and said, \"I see  clearly how one and the other desire draws thee, so that thy care  so binds itself that it breathes not forth. Thou reasonest, 'If  the good will endure, by what reckoning doth the violence "]]]
