When the tongue is  lying too low a lump under the chin beneath the jaw will form in singing  and the tight muscles can be easily felt.    When the jaw is perfectly relaxed and the tongue lies flat in the mouth  there will be a slight hollow under the chin and no stiffness in the  muscles.    The tip of the tongue of course is employed in the pronunciation of the  consonants and must be so agile that the minute it has finished its work  it at once resumes the correct position.    In ascending the scale the furrow in the tongue increases as we come to  the higher notes. It is here that the back of the palate begins to draw  up in order to add to the resonance of the head notes, giving the  cavities of the head free play.    You can easily see your back palate working by opening your mouth wide  and giving yourself the sensation of one about to sneeze. You will see  far back in the throat, way behind the nose, a soft spot that will draw  up of itself as the sneeze becomes more imminent. That little point is  the soft palate. It must be drawn up for the high notes in order to get  the head resonance. As a singer advances in her art she can do this at  will.    The adjustment of throat, tongue and palate, all working together, will  daily respond more easily to her demands. However, she should be able  consciously to control each part by itself.    The conscious direction of the voice and command of the throat are  necessary. Frequently in opera the singer, sitting or lying in some  uncomfortable position which is not naturally convenient for producing  the voice, will consciously direct her notes into the head cavities by  opening up the throat and lifting the soft palate. For instance, in the  role of Violetta the music of the last act is sung lying down. In order  to get proper resonance to some of the high notes I have to start them  in the head cavity by means, of course, of the apoggio, or breath prop,  without which the note would be thin and would have no body to it.    The sensation that I have is of a slight pressure of breath striking  almost into a direct line into the cavity behind the forehead over the  eyes without any obstruction or feeling in the throat at all.    This is the correct attack for the head tone, or a tone taken in the  upper register. Before I explain the registers to you I must tell you  one of the funniest compliments I ever received. A very flattering  person was comparing my voice to that of another high soprano whom I  very much admire.    \"Her voice is beautiful, particularly in the upper register,\" I insisted  when the other lady was being criticized.    \"Ah, madame,\" responded the flattering critic, \"but your registers give  out so much more warmth.\"    I think this joke is too good to lose, also the criticism, while unjust  to the other singer, is interesting to the student, because in the high  register, which includes in some voices all the notes above middle C,  the notes are thin and cold unless supported by the apoggio, the breath  prop, of which I have told you so much. People ask whether there are  such things as vocal registers. Certainly there are. There are three  always and sometimes four in very high voices. The ordinary registers  are the low, the middle, the high voice, or head voice, and sometimes  the second high voice, which has been called the flagellant voice.    A vocal register is a series of tones which are produced by a certain  position of the larynx, tongue and palate. In the woman's voice the  middle register takes in the notes from E on the first line of the staff  about to middle C. The head voice begins at middle C and runs up  sometimes to the end of the voice, sometimes to B flat or C, where it  joins the second head register, which I have heard ascend into a whistle  in phenomenal voices cultivated only in this register and useless for  vocal work.    Though the registers exist and the tones in middle, below and above are  not produced in the same manner, the voice should be so equalized that  the change in registers cannot be heard. And a tone sung with a head  voice and in the low voice should have the same degree of quality,  resonance and power.    As the voice ascends in the scale each note is different, and as one  goes on up the positions of the organ of the throat cannot remain the  same for several different tones. But there should never be an abrupt  change, either audible to the audience or felt in the singer's throat.  Every tone must be imperceptibly prepared, and upon the elasticity of  the vocal organs depends the smoothness of the tone production.  Adjusting the vocal apparatus to the high register should be both  imperceptible and mechanical whenever a high note has to be sung.    In the high register the head voice, or voice which vibrates in the head  cavities, should be used chiefly. The middle register requires palatal  resonance, and the first notes of the head register and the last ones of  the middle require a judicious blending of both. The middle register can  be dragged up to the high notes, but always at the cost first of the  beauty of the voice and then of the voice itself, for no organ can stand  being used wrongly for a long time.    This is only one of the reasons that so many fine big voices go to  pieces long before they should.    In an excess of enthusiasm the young singer attempts to develop the high  notes and make them sound--in her own ears, at all events--as big as the  middle voice. The pure head tone sounds small and feeble to the singer  herself, and she would rather use the chest quality, but the head tone  has the piercing, penetrating quality which makes it tell in a big  hall, while the middle register, unless used in its right place, makes  the voice muffled, heavy and lacking in vibrancy. Though to the singer  the tone may seem immense, in reality it lacks resonance.    A singer must never cease listening to herself intelligently and never  neglect cultivating the head tone or over-tone of the voice, which is  its salvation, for it means vibrancy, carrying power and youth to a  voice. Without it the finest voice soon becomes worn and off pitch. Used  judiciously it will preserve a voice into old age.          Tone Emission and Attack      In my first talk I said a few words, but not half enough, on the subject  of breath control.    My second talk was the physiological aspect of the throat, head and  tongue, for it is necessary to become thoroughly acquainted with the  mechanism with which you are to work before you can really sing. Today  I'm going to take up the subject of tone emission and the attack.    A great many singers suffer from the defect called \"throatiness\" of the  emission--that is to say, they attack or start the note in the throat.  Sooner or later this attack will ruin the most beautiful voice. As I  have said before, the attack of the note must come from the apoggio, or  breath prop. But to have the attack pure and perfectly in tune you must  have the throat entirely open, for it is useless to try to sing if the  throat is not sufficiently open to let the sound pass freely. Throaty  tones or pinched tones are tones which are trying to force themselves  through a half-closed throat blocked either by insufficient opening of  the larynx or by stoppage of the throat passage, due to the root of the  tongue being forced down and back too hard or possibly to a low, soft  palate.    In order to have the throat perfectly open it is necessary to have the  jaw absolutely relaxed.    I have found in studying different nationalities that it is fairly easy  for the French and Spanish people to learn this relaxation of jaw and  the opening of the throat, but the English-speaking people generally  talk with the throat half shut and even talk through half-shut teeth.  Sometime, when you are talking rapidly, suddenly put your hand up to  your jaw. You will find that it is stiff; that the muscles beneath it  (tongue muscles) are tight and hard; that the jaw seldom goes down very  far in pronouncing any of the English words, whereas in singing the jaw  should be absolutely relaxed, going down and back just as far as it can  with ease.    The jaw is attached to the skull right beneath the temples in front of  the ears. By placing your two fingers there and dropping the jaw you  will find that a space between the skull and jaw grows as the jaw drops.    In singing this space must be as wide as is possible, for that indicates  that the jaw is dropped down, giving its aid to the opening at the back  of the throat. It will help the beginner sometimes to do simple relaxing  exercises, feeling the jaw drop with the fingers. It must drop down, and  it is not necessary to open the mouth wide, because the jaw is relaxed  to its utmost.    However, for a beginner it is as well to practice opening the mouth  wide, being sure to lower the jaw at the back. Do this many times a day  without emitting any sound merely to get the feeling of what an open  throat is really like. You will presently begin to yawn after you have  done the exercise a couple of times. In yawning or in starting to drink  a sip of water the throat is widely open, and the sensation is a correct  one which the singer must study to reproduce.    I have noticed a great many actors and actresses in America who speak  with jaws tightly closed, or at least closed to such an extent that only  the smallest emission of breath is possible. Such a voice production  will never allow the actor to express any varying degree of emotion and  will also completely eradicate any natural beauty of tone which the  voice may have. However, this is a fault which can easily be overcome by  practicing this daily relaxation of the jaw and always when singing  breathing as if the jaw hung perfectly loose, or, better still, as"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/201"],[0,"Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions (Illustrated) (#3)"],[1,"injury to an  inconsiderate or perhaps absent-minded traveller suddenly therefore,  running against them:  and as early as the eleventh century of our era,  triangular houses were universally forbidden by Law, the only  exceptions being fortifications, powder-magazines, barracks, and other  state buildings, which it is not desirable that the general public  should approach without circumspection.

But, about three centuries afterwards,  the Law decided that in all towns containing a population above ten  thousand, the angle of a Pentagon was the smallest house-angle that  could be allowed consistently with the public safety.  The good sense  of the community has seconded the efforts of the Legislature; and now,  even in the country, the pentagonal construction has superseded every  other.  It is only now and then in some very remote and backward  agricultural district that an antiquarian may still discover a square  house.          Section 3.  Concerning the Inhabitants of Flatland        The greatest length or breadth of a full grown inhabitant of Flatland  may be estimated at about eleven of your inches.  Twelve inches may be  regarded as a maximum.    Our Women are Straight Lines.    Our Soldiers and Lowest Classes of Workmen are Triangles with two equal  sides, each about eleven inches long, and a base or third side so short  (often not exceeding half an inch) that they form at their vertices a  very sharp and formidable angle.  Indeed when their bases are of the  most degraded type (not more than the eighth part of an inch in size),  they can hardly be distinguished from Straight Lines or Women; so  extremely pointed are their vertices.  With us, as with you, these  Triangles are distinguished from others by being called Isosceles; and  by this name I shall refer to them in the following pages.    Our Middle Class consists of Equilateral or Equal-Sided Triangles.    Our Professional Men and Gentlemen are Squares (to which class I myself  belong) and Five-Sided Figures or Pentagons.    Next above these come the Nobility, of whom there are several degrees,  beginning at Six-Sided Figures, or Hexagons, and from thence rising in  the number of their sides till they receive the honourable title of  Polygonal, or many-sided.  Finally when the number of the sides becomes  so numerous, and the sides themselves so small, that the figure cannot  be distinguished from a circle, he is included in the Circular or  Priestly order; and this is the highest class of all.    It is a Law of Nature with us that a male child shall have one more  side than his father, so that each generation shall rise (as a rule)  one step in the scale of development and nobility.  Thus the son of a  Square is a Pentagon; the son of a Pentagon, a Hexagon; and so on.    But this rule applies not always to the Tradesmen, and still less often  to the Soldiers, and to the Workmen; who indeed can hardly be said to  deserve the name of human Figures, since they have not all their sides  equal.  With them therefore the Law of Nature does not hold; and the  son of an Isosceles (i.e. a Triangle with two sides equal) remains  Isosceles still.  Nevertheless, all hope is not shut out, even from the  Isosceles, that his posterity may ultimately rise above his degraded  condition.  For, after a long series of military successes, or diligent  and skilful labours, it is generally found that the more intelligent  among the Artisan and Soldier classes manifest a slight increase of  their third side or base, and a shrinkage of the two other sides.  Intermarriages (arranged by the Priests) between the sons and daughters  of these more intellectual members of the lower classes generally  result in an offspring approximating still more to the type of the  Equal-Sided Triangle.    Rarely--in proportion to the vast numbers of Isosceles births--is a  genuine and certifiable Equal-Sided Triangle produced from Isosceles  parents.  [Note:  \"What need of a certificate?\" a Spaceland critic may  ask:  \"Is not the procreation of a Square Son a certificate from Nature  herself, proving the Equal-sidedness of the Father?\"  I reply that no  Lady of any position will marry an uncertified Triangle.  Square  offspring has sometimes resulted from a slightly Irregular Triangle;  but in almost every such case the Irregularity of the first generation  is visited on the third; which either fails to attain the Pentagonal  rank, or relapses to the Triangular.]  Such a birth requires, as its  antecedents, not only a series of carefully arranged intermarriages,  but also a long, continued exercise of frugality and self-control on  the part of the would-be ancestors of the coming Equilateral, and a  patient, systematic, and continuous development of the Isosceles  intellect through many generations.    The birth of a True Equilateral Triangle from Isosceles parents is the  subject of rejoicing in our country for many furlongs around.  After a  strict examination conducted by the Sanitary and Social Board, the  infant, if certified as Regular, is with solemn ceremonial admitted  into the class of Equilaterals.  He is then immediately taken from his  proud yet sorrowing parents and adopted by some childless Equilateral,  who is bound by oath never to permit the child henceforth to enter his  former home or so much as to look upon his relations again, for fear  lest the freshly developed organism may, by force of unconscious  imitation, fall back again into his hereditary level.    The occasional emergence of an Equilateral from the ranks of his  serf-born ancestors is welcomed, not only by the poor serfs themselves,  as a gleam of light and hope shed upon the monotonous squalor of their  existence, but also by the Aristocracy at large; for all the higher  classes are well aware that these rare phenomena, while they do little  or nothing to vulgarize their own privileges, serve as a most useful  barrier against revolution from below.    Had the acute-angled rabble been all, without exception, absolutely  destitute of hope and of ambition, they might have found leaders in  some of their many seditious outbreaks, so able as to render their  superior numbers and strength too much even for the wisdom of the  Circles.  But a wise ordinance of Nature has decreed that, in  proportion as the working-classes increase in intelligence, knowledge,  and all virtue, in that same proportion their acute angle (which makes  them physically terrible) shall increase also and approximate to the  comparatively harmless angle of the Equilateral Triangle.  Thus, in the  most brutal and formidable of the soldier class--creatures almost on a  level with women in their lack of intelligence--it is found that, as  they wax in the mental ability necessary to employ their tremendous  penetrating power to advantage, so do they wane in the power of  penetration itself.    How admirable is this Law of Compensation!  And how perfect a proof of  the natural fitness and, I may almost say, the divine origin of the  aristocratic constitution of the States in Flatland!  By a judicious  use of this Law of Nature, the Polygons and Circles are almost always  able to stifle sedition in its very cradle, taking advantage of the  irrepressible and boundless hopefulness of the human mind.  Art also  comes to the aid of Law and Order.  It is generally found possible--by  a little artificial compression or expansion on the part of the State  physicians--to make some of the more intelligent leaders of a rebellion  perfectly Regular, and to admit them at once into the privileged  classes; a much larger number, who are still below the standard,  allured by the prospect of being ultimately ennobled, are induced to  enter the State Hospitals, where they are kept in honourable  confinement for life; one or two alone of the more obstinate, foolish,  and hopelessly irregular are led to execution.    Then the wretched rabble of the Isosceles, planless and leaderless, are  either transfixed without resistance by the small body of their  brethren whom the Chief Circle keeps in pay for emergencies of this  kind; or else more often, by means of jealousies and suspicions  skilfully fomented among them by the Circular party, they are stirred  to mutual warfare, and perish by one another's angles.  No less than  one hundred and twenty rebellions are recorded in our annals, besides  minor outbreaks numbered at two hundred and thirty-five; and they have  all ended thus.          Section 4.  Concerning the Women        If our highly pointed Triangles of the Soldier class are formidable, it  may be readily inferred that far more formidable are our Women.  For if  a Soldier is a wedge, a Woman is a needle; being, so to speak, ALL  point, at least at the two extremities.  Add to this the power of  making herself practically invisible at will, and you will perceive  that a Female, in Flatland, is a creature by no means to be trifled  with.    But here, perhaps, some of my younger Readers may ask HOW a woman in  Flatland can make herself invisible.  This ought, I think, to be  apparent without any explanation.  However, a few words will make it  clear to the most unreflecting.    Place a needle on a table.  Then, with your eye on the level of the  table, look at it side-ways, and you"]]]
