Running along  the shore to the south of the town is the Cours d'Ajot, one of the finest  promenades of its kind in France, named after the engineer who constructed  it. It is planted with trees and adorned with marble statues of Neptune and  Abundance by Antoine Coysevox. The castle with its donjon and seven towers  (12th to the 16th centuries), commanding the entrance to the river, is the  only interesting building in the town. Brest is the capital of one of the  five naval arrondissements of France. The naval port, which is in great  part excavated in the rock, extends along both banks of the Penfeld; it  comprises gun-foundries and workshops, magazines, shipbuilding yards and  repairing docks, and employs about 7000 workmen. There are also large naval  barracks, training ships and naval schools of various kinds, and an  important naval hospital. Brest is the seat of a sub-prefect and has  tribunals of first instance and of commerce, a chamber of commerce, a board  of trade-arbitrators, two naval tribunals, and a tribunal of maritime  commerce. There are also lycees for boys and girls and a school of commerce  and industry. The commercial port, which is separated from the town itself  by the Cours d'Ajot, comprises a tidal port with docks and an outer  harbour; it is protected by jetties to the east and west and by a  breakwater on the south. In 1905 the number of vessels entered was 202 with  a tonnage of 67,755, and cleared 160 with a tonnage of 61,012. The total  value of the imports in 1905 was L244,000. The chief were wine, coal,  timber, mineral tar, fertilizers and lobsters and crayfish. Exports, of  which the chief were wheat-flour, fruit and superphosphates, were valued at  L40,000. Besides its sardine and mackerel fishing industry, the town has  flour-mills, breweries, foundries, forges, engineering works, and  manufactures of blocks, candles, chemicals (from sea-weed), boots, shoes  and linen. Brest communicates by submarine cable with America and French  West Africa. The roadstead consists of a deep indentation with a maximum  length of 14 m. and an average width of 4 m., the mouth being barred by the  peninsula of Quelern, leaving a passage from 1 to 2 m. broad, known as the  Goulet. The outline of the bay is broken by numerous smaller bays or arms,  formed by the embouchures of streams, the most important being the Anse de  Quelern, the Anse de Poulmie, and the mouths of the Chateaulin and the  Landerneau. Brest is a fortress of the first class. The fortifications of  the town and the harbour fall into four groups: (1) the very numerous forts  and batteries guarding the approaches to and the channel of the Goulet; (2)  the batteries and forts directed upon the roads; (3) a group of works  preventing access to the peninsula of Quelern and commanding the ground to  the south of the peninsula from which many of the works of group (2) could  be taken in reverse; (4) the defences of Brest itself, consisting of an  old-fashioned _enceinte_ possessing little military value and a chain of  detached forts to the west of the town.    Nothing definite is known of Brest till about 1240, when it was ceded by a  count of Leon to John I., duke of Brittany. In 1342 John of Montfort gave  it up to the English, and it did not finally leave their hands till 1397.  Its medieval importance was great enough to give rise to the saying, \"He is  not duke of Brittany who is not lord of Brest.\" By the marriage of Francis  I. with Claude, daughter of Anne of Brittany, Brest with the rest of the  duchy definitely passed to the French crown. The advantages of the  situation for a seaport town were first recognized by Richelieu, who in  1631 constructed a harbour with wooden wharves, which soon became a station  of the French navy. Colbert changed the wooden wharves for masonry and  otherwise improved the post, and Vauban's fortifications followed in  1680-1688. During the 18th century the fortifications and the naval  importance of the town continued to develop. In 1694 an English squadron  under John, 3rd Lord Berkeley, was miserably defeated in attempting a  landing; but in 1794, during the revolutionary war, the French fleet, under  Villaret de Joyeuse, was as thoroughly beaten in the same place by the  English admiral Howe.    BREST-LITOVSK (Polish _Brzesc-Litevski_; and in the Chron. _Berestie_ and  _Berestov_), a strongly fortified town of Russia, in the government of  Grodno, 137 m. by rail S. from the city of Grodno, in 52 deg. 5' N. lat. and  23 deg. 39' E. long., at the junction of the navigable river Mukhovets with the  Bug, and at the intersection of railways from Warsaw, Kiev, Moscow and East  Prussia. Pop. (1867) 22,493; (1901) 42,812, of whom more than one-half were  Jews. It contains a Jewish synagogue, which was regarded in the 16th  century as the first in Europe, and is the seat of an Armenian and of a  Greek Catholic bishop; the former has authority over the Armenians  throughout the whole country. The town carries on an extensive trade in  grain, flax, hemp, wood, tar and leather. First mentioned in the beginning  of the 11th century, Brest-Litovsk was in 1241 laid waste by the Mongols  and was not rebuilt till 1275; its suburbs were burned by the Teutonic  Knights in 1379; and in the end of the 15th century the whole town met a  similar fate at the hands of the khan of the Crimea. In the reign of the  Polish king Sigismund III. diets were held there; and in 1594 and 1596 it  was the meeting-place of two remarkable councils of the bishops of western  Russia. In 1657, and again in 1706, the town was captured by the Swedes; in  1794 it was the scene of Suvarov's victory over the Polish general  Sierakowski; in 1795 it was added to the Russian empire. The Brest-Litovsk  or King's canal (50 m. long), utilizing the Mukhovets-Bug rivers, forms a  link in the waterways that connect the Dnieper with the Vistula.    BRETEUIL, LOUIS CHARLES AUGUSTE LE TONNELIER, BARON DE (1730-1807), French  diplomatist, was born at the chateau of Azay-le-Feron (Indre) on the 7th of  March 1730. He was only twenty-eight when he was appointed by Louis XV.  ambassador to the elector of Cologne, and two years later he was sent to St  Petersburg. He arranged to be temporarily absent from his post at the time  of the palace revolution by which Catherine II. was placed on the throne.  In 1769 he was sent to Stockholm, and subsequently represented his  government at Vienna, Naples, and again at Vienna until 1783, when he was  recalled to become minister of the king's household. In this capacity he  introduced considerable reforms in prison administration. A close friend of  Marie Antoinette, he presently came into collision with Calonne, who  demanded his dismissal in 1787. His influence with the king and queen,  especially with the latter, remained unshaken, and on Necker's dismissal on  the 11th of July 1789, Breteuil succeeded him as chief minister. The fall  of the Bastille three days later put an end to the new ministry, and  Breteuil made his way to Switzerland with the first party of _emigres_. At  Soleure, in November 1790, he received from Louis XVI. exclusive powers to  negotiate with the European courts, and in his efforts to check the  ill-advised diplomacy of the _emigre_ princes, he soon brought himself into  opposition with his old rival Calonne, who held a chief place in their  councils. [v.04 p.0501] After the failure of the flight to Varennes, in the  arrangement of which he had a share, Breteuil received instructions from  Louis XVI., designed to restore amicable relations with the princes. His  distrust of the king's brothers and his defence of Louis XVI.'s prerogative  were to some extent justified, but his intransigeant attitude towards these  princes emphasized the dissensions of the royal family in the eyes of  foreign sovereigns, who looked on the comte de Provence as the natural  representative of his brother and found a pretext for non-interference on  Louis's behalf in the contradictory statements of the negotiators. Breteuil  himself was the object of violent attacks from the party of the princes,  who asserted that he persisted in exercising powers which had been revoked  by Louis XVI. After the execution of Marie Antoinette he retired into  private life near Hamburg, only returning to France in 1802. He died in  Paris on the 2nd of November 1807.

Daudet, _Coblentz,  1789-1793_ (1889), forming part of his _Hist. de l'emigration._    BRETIGNY, a French town (dept. Eure-et-Loir, arrondissement and canton of  Chartres, commune of Sours), which gave its name to a celebrated treaty  concluded there on the 8th of May 1360, between Edward III. of England and  John II., surnamed the Good, of France. The exactions of the English, who  wished to yield as few as possible of the advantages claimed by them in the  treaty of London, made negotiations difficult, and the discussion of terms  begun early in April lasted more than a month. By virtue of this treaty  Edward III. obtained, besides Guienne and Gascony, Poitou, Saintonge and  Aunis, Agenais, Perigord, Limousin, Quercy, Bigorre, the countship of  Gaure, Angoumois, Rouergue, Montreuil-sur-mer, Ponthieu, Calais, Sangatte,  Ham and the countship of Guines. John II. had, moreover, to pay three  millions of gold crowns for his ransom. On his side the king of England  gave up the duchies of Normandy and Touraine, the countships of Anjou and  Maine, and the suzerainty of Brittany and of Flanders. As a guarantee for  the payment of his ransom, John the Good gave as hostages two of his sons,  several princes and nobles, four inhabitants of Paris, and two citizens  from each of the nineteen principal towns of France."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19706"],[0,"Brood of the Witch-Queen (#3)"],[1,"Ferrara's address. He could  scarcely trust himself to think, but frightful possibilities presented  themselves to him, repel them how he might. London seemed to grow  dark, overshadowed, as once he had seen a Thames backwater grow. He  shuddered, as though from a physical chill.    The house of the famous Egyptian scholar, dull white behind its  rampart of trees, presented no unusual appearances to his anxious  scrutiny. What he feared he scarcely knew; what he suspected he could  not have defined.    Sir Michael, said the servant, was unwell and could see no one. That  did not surprise Cairn; Sir Michael had not enjoyed good health since  malaria had laid him low in Syria. But Miss Duquesne was at home.    Cairn was shown into the long, low-ceiled room which contained so many  priceless relics of a past civilisation. Upon the bookcase stood the  stately ranks of volumes which had carried the fame of Europe's  foremost Egyptologist to every corner of the civilised world. This  queerly furnished room held many memories for Robert Cairn, who had  known it from childhood, but latterly it had always appeared to him in  his daydreams as the setting for a dainty figure. It was here that he  had first met Myra Duquesne, Sir Michael's niece, when, fresh from a  Norman convent, she had come to shed light and gladness upon the  somewhat, sombre household of the scholar. He often thought of that  day; he could recall every detail of the meeting--    Myra Duquesne came in, pulling aside the heavy curtains that hung in  the arched entrance. With a granite Osiris flanking her slim figure on  one side and a gilded sarcophagus on the other, she burst upon the  visitor, a radiant vision in white. The light gleamed through her  soft, brown hair forming a halo for a face that Robert Cairn knew for  the sweetest in the world.    \"Why, Mr. Cairn,\" she said, and blushed entrancingly--\"we thought you  had forgotten us.\"    \"That's not a little bit likely,\" he replied, taking her proffered  hand, and there was that in his voice and in his look which made her  lower her frank grey eyes. \"I have only been in London a few days, and  I find that Press work is more exacting than I had anticipated!\"    \"Did you want to see my uncle very particularly?\" asked Myra.    \"In a way, yes. I suppose he could not manage to see me--\"    Myra shook her head. Now that the flush of excitement had left her  face, Cairn was concerned to see how pale she was and what dark  shadows lurked beneath her eyes.    \"Sir Michael is not seriously ill?\" he asked quickly. \"Only one of the  visual attacks--\"    \"Yes--at least it began with one.\"    She hesitated, and Cairn saw to his consternation that her eyes became  filled with tears. The real loneliness of her position, now that her  guardian was ill, the absence of a friend in whom she could confide  her fears, suddenly grew apparent to the man who sat watching her.    \"You are tired out,\" he said gently. \"You have been nursing him?\"    She nodded and tried to smile.    \"Who is attending?\"    \"Sir Elwin Groves, but--\"    \"Shall I wire for my father?\"    \"We wired for him yesterday!\"    \"What! to Paris?\"    \"Yes, at my uncle's wish.\"    Cairn started.    \"Then--he thinks he is seriously ill, himself?\"    \"I cannot say,\" answered the girl wearily. \"His behaviour is--queer.  He will allow no one in his room, and barely consents to see Sir  Elwin. Then, twice recently, he has awakened in the night and made a  singular request.\"    \"What is that?\"    \"He has asked me to send for his solicitor in the morning, speaking  harshly and almost as though--he hated me....\"    \"I don't understand. Have you complied?\"    \"Yes, and on each occasion he has refused to see the solicitor when he  has arrived!\"    \"I gather that you have been acting as night-attendant?\"    \"I remain in an adjoining room; he is always worse at night. Perhaps  it is telling on my nerves, but last night--\"    Again she hesitated, as though doubting the wisdom of further speech;  but a brief scrutiny of Cairn's face, with deep anxiety to be read in  his eyes, determined her to proceed.    \"I had been asleep, and I must have been dreaming, for I thought that  a voice was chanting, quite near to me.\"    \"Chanting?\"    \"Yes--it was horrible, in some way. Then a sensation of intense  coldness came; it was as though some icily cold creature fanned me  with its wings! I cannot describe it, but it was numbing; I think I  must have felt as those poor travellers do who succumb to the  temptation to sleep in the snow.\"    Cairn surveyed her anxiously, for in its essentials this might be a  symptom of a dreadful ailment.    \"I aroused myself, however,\" she continued, \"but experienced an  unaccountable dread of entering my uncle's room. I could hear him  muttering strangely, and--I forced myself to enter! I saw--oh, how  can I tell you! You will think me mad!\"    She raised her hands to her face; she was trembling. Robert Cairn took  them in his own, forcing her to look up.    \"Tell me,\" he said quietly.    \"The curtains were drawn back; I distinctly remembered having closed  them, but they were drawn back; and the moonlight was shining on to  the bed.\"    \"Bad; he was dreaming.\"    \"But was _I_ dreaming? Mr. Cairn, two hands were stretched out over my  uncle, two hands that swayed slowly up and down in the moonlight!\"    Cairn leapt to his feet, passing his hand over his forehead.    \"Go on,\" he said.    \"I--I cried out, but not loudly--I think I was very near to swooning.  The hands were withdrawn into the shadow, and my uncle awoke and sat  up. He asked, in a low voice, if I were there, and I ran to him.\"    \"Yes.\"    \"He ordered me, very coldly, to 'phone for his solicitor at nine  o'clock this morning, and then fell back, and was asleep again almost  immediately. The solicitor came, and was with him for nearly an hour.  He sent for one of his clerks, and they both went away at half-past  ten. Uncle has been in a sort of dazed condition ever since; in fact  he has only once aroused himself, to ask for Dr. Cairn. I had a  telegram sent immediately.\"    \"The governor will be here to-night,\" said Cairn confidently. \"Tell  me, the hands which you thought you saw: was there anything peculiar  about them?\"    \"In the moonlight they seemed to be of a dull white colour. There was  a ring on one finger--a green ring. Oh!\" she shuddered. \"I can see it  now.\"    \"You would know it again?\"    \"Anywhere!\"    \"Actually, there was no one in the room, of course?\"    \"No one. It was some awful illusion; but I can never forget it.\"          CHAPTER III    THE RING OF THOTH      Half-Moon Street was very still; midnight had sounded nearly  half-an-hour; but still Robert Cairn paced up and down his father's  library. He was very pale, and many times he glanced at a book which  lay open upon the table. Finally he paused before it and read once  again certain passages.    \"In the year 1571,\" it recorded, \"the notorious Trois Echelles was  executed in the Place de Greve. He confessed before the king, Charles  IX.... that he performed marvels.... Admiral de Coligny, who also was  present, recollected ... the death of two gentlemen.... He added that  they were found black and swollen.\"    He turned over the page, with a hand none too steady.    \"The famous Marechal d'Ancre, Concini Concini,\" he read, \"was killed  by a pistol shot on the drawbridge of the Louvre by Vitry, Captain of  the Bodyguard, on the 24th of April, 1617.... It was proved that the  Marechal and his wife made use of wax images, which they kept in  coffins....\"    Cairn shut the book hastily and began to pace the room again.    \"Oh, it is utterly, fantastically incredible!\" he groaned. \"Yet, with  my own eyes I saw--\"    He stepped to a bookshelf and began to look for a book which, so far  as his slight knowledge of the subject bore him, would possibly throw  light upon the darkness. But he failed to find it. Despite the heat of  the weather, the library seemed to have grown chilly. He pressed the  bell.    \"Marston,\" he said to the man who presently came, \"you must be very  tired, but Dr. Cairn will be here within an hour. Tell him that I  have gone to Sir Michael Ferrara's.\"    \"But it's after twelve o'clock, sir!\"    \"I know it is; nevertheless I am going.\"    \"Very good, sir. You will wait there for the Doctor?\"    \"Exactly, Marston. Good-night!\"    \"Good-night, sir.\"    Robert Cairn went out into Half-Moon Street. The night was perfect,  and the cloudless sky lavishly gemmed with stars. He walked on  heedlessly, scarce noting in which direction. An awful conviction was  with him, growing stronger each moment, that some mysterious menace,  some danger unclassifiable, threatened Myra Duquesne. What did he  suspect? He could give it no name. How should he act? He had no idea.    Sir Elwin Groves, whom he had seen that evening, had hinted broadly at  mental trouble as the solution of Sir Michael Ferrara's peculiar  symptoms. Although Sir Michael had had certain transactions with his  solicitor during the early morning, he had apparently forgotten all  about the matter, according to the celebrated physician.    \"Between ourselves, Cairn,\" Sir Elwin had confided, \"I believe he  altered his will.\"    The inquiry of a taxi driver interrupted Cairn's meditations. He  entered the vehicle, giving Sir Michael Ferrara's address.    His thoughts persistently turned to Myra Duquesne, who at that moment  would be lying listening for the slightest sound from the sick-room;  who would be fighting down fear, that she might do her duty to her  guardian--fear of the waving phantom hands. The cab sped through the  almost empty streets, and at last, rounding a corner, rolled up the  tree-lined avenue, past three or four houses lighted only by the  glitter of the moon, and came to a stop before that of Sir Michael  Ferrara.    Lights shone from the many windows. The front door was open, and light  streamed out into the porch.    \"My"]]]
