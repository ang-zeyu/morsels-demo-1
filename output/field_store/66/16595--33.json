Without wealth there would be no poverty, without knowledge no  ignorance, without light no darkness. Darkness itself is a proof of the  existence of light for darkness is the absence of light.    Now concerning nature, it is but the essential properties and the  necessary relations inherent in the realities of things. And though these  infinite realities are diverse in their character yet they are in the  utmost harmony and closely connected together. As one's vision is  broadened and the matter observed carefully, it will be made certain that  every reality is but an essential requisite of other          [Pages 21-28]      realities. Thus to connect and harmonize these diverse and infinite  realities an all-unifying Power is necessary, that every part of existent  being may in perfect order discharge its own function. Consider the body  of man, and let the part be an indication of the whole. Consider how these  diverse parts and members of the human body are closely connected and  harmoniously united one with the other. Every part is the essential  requisite of all other parts and has a function by itself. It is the mind  that is the all-unifying agency that so uniteth all the component parts  one with the other that each dischargeth its specific function in perfect  order, and thereby co-operation and reaction are made possible. All parts  function under certain laws that are essential to existence. Should that  all-unifying agency that directeth all these parts be harmed in any way  there is no doubt that the constituent parts and members will cease  functioning properly; and though that all-unifying agency in the temple of  man be not sensed or seen and the reality thereof be unknown, yet by its  effects it manifesteth itself with the greatest power.    Thus it hath been proven and made evident that these infinite beings in  this wondrous universe will discharge their functions properly only when  directed and controlled by that Universal Reality, so that order may be  established in the world. For example, interaction and co-operation  between the constituent parts of the human body are evident and  indisputable, yet this does not suffice; an all-unifying agency is  necessary that shall direct and control the component parts, so that these  through interaction and co-operation may discharge in perfect order their  necessary and respective functions.    You are well aware, praised be the Lord, that both interaction and  co-operation are evident and proven amongst all beings, whether large or  small. In the case of large bodies interaction is as manifest as the sun,  whilst in the case of small bodies, though interaction be unknown, yet the  part is an indication of the whole. All these interactions therefore are  connected with that all-embracing power which is their pivot, their  centre, their source and their motive power.    For instance, as we have observed, co-operation among the constituent  parts of the human body is clearly established, and these parts and  members render services unto all the component parts of the body. For  instance, the hand, the foot, the eye, the ear, the mind, the imagination  all help the various parts and members of the human body, but all these  interactions are linked by an unseen, all-embracing power, that causeth  these interactions to be produced with perfect regularity. This is the  inner faculty of man, that is his spirit and his mind, both of which are  invisible.    In like manner consider machinery and workshops and the interaction  existing among the various component parts and sections, and how connected  they are one with the other. All these relations and interactions,  however, are connected with a central power which is their motive force,  their pivot and their source. This central power is either the power of  steam or the skill of the mastermind.    It hath therefore been made evident and proved that interaction,  co-operation and interrelation amongst beings are under the direction and  will of a motive Power which is the origin, the motive force and the pivot  of all interactions in the universe.    Likewise every arrangement and formation that is not perfect in its order  we designate as accidental, and that which is orderly, regular, perfect in  its relations and every part of which is in its proper place and is the  essential requisite of the other constituent parts, this we call a  composition formed through will and knowledge. There is no doubt that  these infinite beings and the association of these diverse elements  arranged in countless forms must have proceeded from a Reality that could  in no wise be bereft of will or understanding. This is clear and proven to  the mind and no one can deny it. It is not meant, however, that that  Universal Reality or the attributes thereof have been comprehended.  Neither its Essence nor its true attributes hath any one comprehended. We  maintain, however, that these infinite beings, these necessary relations,  this perfect arrangement must of necessity have proceeded from a source  that is not bereft of will and understanding, and this infinite  composition cast into infinite forms must have been caused by an  all-embracing Wisdom. This none can dispute save he that is obstinate and  stubborn, and denieth the clear and unmistakable evidence, and becometh  the object of the blessed Verse: 'They are deaf, they are dumb, they are  blind and shall return no more'.    Now regarding the question whether the faculties of the mind and the human  soul are one and the same. These faculties are but the inherent properties  of the soul, such as the power of imagination, of thought, of  understanding; powers that are the essential requisites of the reality of  man, even as the solar ray is the inherent property of the sun. The temple  of man is like unto a mirror, his soul is as the sun, and his mental  faculties even as the rays that emanate from that source of light. The ray  may cease to fall upon the mirror, but it can in no wise be dissociated  from the sun.    In short, the point is this, that the world of man is supernatural in its  relation to the vegetable kingdom, though in reality it is not so.  Relatively to the plant, the reality of man, his power of hearing and  sight, are all supernatural, and for the plant to comprehend that reality  and the nature of the powers of man's mind is impossible. In like manner  for man to comprehend the Divine Essence and the nature of the great  Hereafter is in no wise possible. The merciful outpourings of that Divine  Essence, however, are vouchsafed unto all beings and it is incumbent upon  man to ponder in his heart upon the effusions of the Divine Grace, the  soul being counted as one, rather than upon the Divine Essence itself.  This is the utmost limit for human understanding. As it hath previously  been mentioned, these attributes and perfections that we recount of the  Divine Essence, these we have derived from the existence and observation  of beings, and it is not that we have comprehended the essence and  perfection of God. When we say that the Divine Essence understandeth and  is free, we do not mean that we have discovered the Divine Will and  Purpose, but rather that we have acquired knowledge of them through the  Divine Grace revealed and manifested in the realities of things.    Now concerning our social principles, namely the teachings of His Holiness  Baha'u'llah spread far and wide fifty years ago, they verily comprehend  all other teachings. It is clear and evident that without these teachings  progress and advancement for mankind are in no wise possible. Every  community in the world findeth in these Divine Teachings the realization  of its highest aspirations. These teachings are even as the tree that  beareth the best fruits of all trees. Philosophers, for instance, find in  these heavenly teachings the most perfect solution of their social  problems, and similarly a true and noble exposition of matters that  pertain to philosophical questions. In like manner men of faith behold the  reality of religion manifestly revealed in these heavenly teachings, and  clearly and conclusively prove them to be the real and true remedy for the  ills and infirmities of all mankind. Should these sublime teachings be  diffused, mankind shall be freed from all perils, from all chronic ills  and sicknesses. In like manner are the Baha'i economic principles the  embodiment of the highest aspirations of all wage-earning classes and of  economists of various schools.    In short, all sections and parties have their aspirations realized in the  teachings of Baha'u'llah. As these teachings are declared in churches, in  mosques and in other places of worship, whether those of the followers of  Buddha or of Confucius, in political circles or amongst materialists, all  shall bear witness that these teachings bestow a fresh life upon mankind  and constitute the immediate remedy for all the ills of social life. None  can find fault with any of these teachings, nay rather, once declared they  will all be acclaimed, and all will confess their vital necessity,  exclaiming, 'Verily this is the truth and naught is there beside the truth  but manifest error.'    In conclusion, these few words are written, and unto everyone they will be  a clear and conclusive evidence of the truth. Ponder them in thine heart.  The will of every sovereign prevaileth during his reign, the will of every  philosopher findeth expression in a handful of disciples during his  lifetime, but the Power of the Holy Spirit shineth radiantly in the  realities of the Messengers of God, and strengtheneth Their will in such  wise as to influence a great "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19296"],[0,"Tablets of the Divine Plan (#3)"],[1,"the Morn of Guidance.  Consequently, strive as far as ye are able to send to those parts fluent  speakers, who are detached from aught else save God, attracted with the  fragrances of God, and sanctified and purified from all desires and  temptations. Their sustenance and food must consist of the teachings of  God. First they must themselves live in accordance with those principles,  then guide the people. Perchance, God willing, the lights of the Most  Great Guidance will illuminate that country, and the breezes of the rose  garden of the love of God will perfume the nostrils of the inhabitants of  Alaska. Should you be aided to render such a service, rest ye assured that  your heads shall be crowned with the diadem of everlasting sovereignty,  and at the threshold of oneness you will become the favored and accepted  servants.    6 Likewise the republic of Mexico is very important. The majority of the  inhabitants of that country are devoted Catholics. They are totally  unaware of the reality of the Bible, the Gospel and the new divine  teachings. They do not know that the basis of the religions of God is one  and that the holy Manifestations are like unto the Sun of Truth, rising  from the different dawning-places. Those souls are submerged in the sea of  dogmas. If one breath of life be blown over them, great results will issue  therefrom. But it is better for those who intend to go to Mexico to teach,  to be familiar with the Spanish language.    7 Similarly, the six Central American republics, situated south of  Mexico--Guatemala, Honduras, Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and  the seventh country Belize or British Honduras. The teachers going to  those parts must also be familiar with the Spanish language.    8 Attach great importance to the indigenous population of America. For  these souls may be likened unto the ancient inhabitants of the Arabian  Peninsula, who, prior to the Mission of Muhammad, were like unto savages.  When the light of Muhammad shone forth in their midst, however, they  became so radiant as to illumine the world. Likewise, these Indians,  should they be educated and guided, there can be no doubt that they will  become so illumined as to enlighten the whole world.    9 All the above countries have importance, but especially the Republic of  Panama, wherein the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans come together through the  Panama Canal. It is a center for travel and passage from America to other  continents of the world, and in the future it will gain most great  importance.    10 Likewise the islands of the West Indies, such as Cuba, Haiti, Puerto  Rico, Jamaica, the islands of the Lesser Antilles, Bahama Islands, even  the small Watling Island, have great importance; especially the two black  republics, Haiti and Santo Domingo, situated in the cluster of the Greater  Antilles. Likewise the cluster of the islands of Bermuda in the Atlantic  Ocean have importance.    11 In a similar way, the republics of the continent of South  America--Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, British Guiana, Dutch Guiana,  French Guiana, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Venezuela;  also the islands to the north, east and west of South America, such as  Falkland Islands, the Galapagos, Juan Fernandez, Tobago and Trinidad.  Likewise the city of Bahia, situated on the eastern shore of Brazil.  Because it is some time that it has become known by this name, its  efficacy will be most potent.    12 In short, O ye believers of God! Exalt your effort and magnify your  aims. His Holiness Christ says: Blessed are the poor, for theirs shall be  the Kingdom of Heaven.(11) In other words: Blessed are the nameless and  traceless poor, for they are the leaders of mankind. Likewise it is said  in the Qur'an: \"And We desire to show favor to those who were brought low  in the land, and to make them spiritual leaders among men, and to make of  them Our heirs.\"(12) Or, we wish to grant a favor to the impotent souls  and suffer them to become the inheritors of the Messengers and Prophets.    13 Now is the time for you to divest yourselves of the garment of  attachment to this world that perisheth, to be wholly severed from the  physical world, become heavenly angels, and travel to these countries. I  swear by Him, besides Whom there is none other God, that each one of you  will become an Israfil of Life, and will blow the Breath of Life into the  souls of others.    14 Upon you be greeting and praise!    Supplication    O THOU Incomparable God! O Thou Lord of the Kingdom! These souls are Thy  heavenly army. Assist them and, with the cohorts of the Supreme Concourse,  make them victorious, so that each one of them may become like unto a  regiment and conquer these countries through the love of God and the  illumination of divine teachings.    O God! Be Thou their supporter and their helper, and in the wilderness,  the mountain, the valley, the forests, the prairies and the seas, be Thou  their confidant--so that they may cry out through the power of the Kingdom  and the breath of the Holy Spirit.    Verily, Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty and the Omnipotent, and Thou art  the Wise, the Hearing and the Seeing.            7: TABLET TO THE BAHA'IS OF THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA      _Revealed on April 11, 1916, in 'Abdu'l-Baha's room at the house in Bahji,  and addressed to the Baha'is of the United States and Canada. _    1                                   _He is God!_    O ye real Baha'is of America:    2 Praise be to His Highness the Desired One that ye have become confirmed  in the promotion of divine teachings in that vast Continent, raised the  call of the Kingdom of God in that region and announced the glad tidings  of the manifestation of the Lord of Hosts and His Highness the Promised  One. Thanks be unto the Lord that ye have become assisted and confirmed in  this aim. This is purely through the confirmations of the Lord of Hosts  and the breaths of the Holy Spirit. The full measure of your success is as  yet unrevealed, its significance still unapprehended. Erelong ye will,  with your own eyes, witness how brilliantly every one of you, even as a  shining star, will radiate in the firmament of your country the light of  divine Guidance, and will bestow upon its people the glory of an  everlasting life.    3 Consider! The station and the confirmation of the apostles in the time  of Christ was not known, and no one looked on them with the feeling of  importance--nay, rather, they persecuted and ridiculed them. Later on it  became evident what crowns studded with the brilliant jewels of guidance  were placed on the heads of the apostles, Mary Magdalene and Mary the  mother of John.    4 The range of your future achievements still remains undisclosed. I  fervently hope that in the near future the whole earth may be stirred and  shaken by the results of your achievements. The hope, therefore, which  'Abdu'l-Baha cherishes for you is that the same success which has attended  your efforts in America may crown your endeavors in other parts of the  world, that through you the fame of the Cause of God may be diffused  throughout the East and the West and the advent of the Kingdom of the Lord  of Hosts be proclaimed in all the five continents of the globe.    5 The moment this divine Message is carried forward by the American  believers from the shores of America and is propagated through the  continents of Europe, of Asia, of Africa and of Australasia, and as far as  the islands of the Pacific, this community will find itself securely  established upon the throne of an everlasting dominion. Then will all the  peoples of the world witness that this community is spiritually illumined  and divinely guided. Then will the whole earth resound with the praises of  its majesty and greatness. A party speaking their languages, severed,  holy, sanctified and filled with the love of God, must turn their faces to  and travel through the three great island groups of the Pacific  Ocean--Polynesia, Micronesia and Melanesia, and the islands attached to  these groups, such as New Guinea, Borneo, Java, Sumatra, Philippine  Islands, Solomon Islands, Fiji Islands, New Hebrides, Loyalty Islands, New  Caledonia, Bismarck Archipelago, Ceram, Celebes, Friendly Islands, Samoa  Islands, Society Islands, Caroline Islands, Low Archipelago, Marquesas,  Hawaiian Islands, Gilbert Islands, Moluccas, Marshall Islands, Timor and  the other islands. With hearts overflowing with the love of God, with  tongues commemorating the mention of God, with eyes turned to the Kingdom  of God, they must deliver the glad tidings of the manifestation of the  Lord of Hosts to all the people. Know ye of a certainty that whatever  gathering ye enter, the waves of the Holy Spirit are surging over it, and  the heavenly grace of the Blessed Beauty encompasseth that gathering.    6 Consider ye, that Miss Agnes Alexander, the daughter of the Kingdom, the  beloved maidservant of the Blessed Perfection, traveled alone to the  Hawaiian Islands, to the Island of Honolulu, and now she is gaining  spiritual victories in Japan! Reflect ye how this daughter was confirmed  in the Hawaiian Islands. She became the cause of the guidance of a  gathering of people.    7 Likewise Miss Knobloch traveled alone to Germany. To what a great extent  she became confirmed! Therefore, know ye of a certainty that whosoever  arises in this day to diffuse the divine fragrances, the cohorts of the  Kingdom of God shall confirm him and the bestowals and the favors of the  Blessed Perfection shall encircle him.    8 O that I could travel, even though on foot and in the utmost poverty, to  these regions, and, raising the call of \"Ya Baha'u'l-Abha\" in cities,  villages, mountains, deserts and oceans, promote the divine teachings!  This, alas, I cannot do. How intensely I deplore it! Please God, ye may  achieve it.    9 At this time, in the Hawaiian Islands, through the efforts of Miss  Alexander, a"]]]
