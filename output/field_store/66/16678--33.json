These things are patent. Even  so! it is painful to say it, but there is silence concerning this  crime; it is there, men see it, touch it, and pass on to their  business; shops are opened, the stock jobbers job, Commerce, seated on  her packages, rubs her hands, and the moment is close at hand when  everybody will regard all that has taken place as a matter of course.  He who measures cloth does not hear the yard-stick in his hand speak to  him and say: \"'Tis a false measure that governs.\" He who weighs out a  commodity does not hear his scales raise their voice and say: \"'Tis a  false weight that reigns.\" A strange order of things surely, that has  for its base supreme disorder, the negation of all law! equilibrium  resting on iniquity!    Let us add,--what, for that matter is self-evident,--that the author of  this crime is a malefactor of the most cynical and lowest description.    At this moment, let all who wear a robe, a scarf, or a uniform; let all  those who serve this man, know, if they think themselves the agents of  a power, that they deceive themselves; they are the shipmates of a  pirate. Ever since the 2nd of December there have been no  office-holders in France, there have been only accomplices. The moment  has come when every one must take careful account of what he has done,  of what he is continuing to do. The gendarmes who arrested those whom  the man of Strasburg and Boulogne called \"insurgents,\" arrested the  guardians of the Constitution. The judge who tried the combatants of  Paris or the provinces, placed in the dock the mainstays of the law.  The officer who confined in the hulks the \"condemned men,\" confined the  defenders of the Republic and of the State. The general in Africa who  imprisoned at Lambassa the transported men bending beneath the sun's  fierce heat, shivering with fever, digging in the sun-baked soil a  furrow destined to be their grave, that general sequestrated, tortured,  assassinated the men of the law. All, generals, officers, gendarmes,  judges, are absolutely under forfeiture. They have before them more  than innocent men,--heroes! more than victims,--martyrs!    Let them know this, therefore, and let them hasten to act upon the  knowledge; let them, at least, break the fetters, draw the bolts, empty  the hulks, throw open the jails, since they have not still the courage  to grasp the sword. Up, consciences, awake, it is full time!    If law, right, duty, reason, common sense, equity, justice, suffice  not, let them think of the future! If remorse is mute, let  responsibility speak!    And let all those who, being landed proprietors, shake the magistrate  by the hand; who, being bankers, fete a general; who, being peasants,  salute a gendarme; let all those who do not shun the hotel in which  dwells the minister, the house in which dwells the prefect, as he would  shun a _lazaretto_; let all those who, being simple citizens, not  functionaries, go to the balls and the banquets of Louis Bonaparte and  see not that the black flag waves over the Elysee,--let all these in  like manner know that this sort of shame is contagious; if they avoid  material complicity, they will not avoid moral complicity.    The crime of the 2nd of December bespatters them.    The present situation, that seems so calm to the unthinking, is most  threatening, be sure of that. When public morality is under eclipse, an  appalling shadow settles down upon social order.    All guarantees take wing, all supports vanish.    Thenceforth there is not in France a tribunal, nor a court, nor a  judge, to render justice and pronounce a sentence, on any subject,  against any one, in the name of any one.    Bring before the assizes a malefactor of any sort: the thief will say  to the judges: \"The chief of the State robbed the Bank of twenty-five  millions;\" the false witness will say to the judges: \"The chief of the  State took an oath in the face of God and of man, and that oath he has  violated;\" the sequestrator will say: \"The chief of the State has  arrested, and detained against all law, the representatives of the  sovereign people;\" the swindler will say: \"The chief of the State got  his election, got power, got the Tuileries, all by swindling;\" the  forger will say: \"The chief of the State forged votes;\" the footpad  will say: \"The chief of the State stole their purses from the Princes  of Orleans;\" the murderer will say: \"The chief of the State shot,  sabred, bayonetted, massacred passengers in the streets;\" and all  together, swindler, forger, false witness, footpad, robber, assassin,  will add: \"And you judges, you have been to salute this man, to praise  him for having perjured himself, to compliment him for committing  forgery, to praise him for stealing and swindling, to thank him for  murdering! what do you want of us?\"    Assuredly, this is a very serious state of things! to sleep in such a  situation, is additional ignominy.    It is time, we repeat, that this monstrous slumber of men's consciences  should end. It must not be, after that fearful scandal, the triumph of  crime, that a scandal still more fearful should be presented to  mankind: the indifference of the civilized world.    If that were to be, history would appear one day as an avenger; and  from this very hour, as the wounded lion takes refuge in the solitudes,  the just man, veiling his face in presence of this universal  degradation, would take refuge in the immensity of public contempt.          IV    MEN WILL AWAKEN      But it is not to be; men will awaken.    The present book has for its sole aim to arouse the sleepers. France  must not even adhere to this government with the assent of lethargy; at  certain hours, in certain places, under certain shadows, to sleep is to  die.    Let us add that at this moment, France--strange to say, but none the  less true--knows not what took place on the 2nd of December and  subsequently, or knows it imperfectly; and this is her excuse. However,  thanks to several generous and courageous publications, the facts are  beginning to creep out. This book is intended to bring some of those  facts forward, and, if it please God, to present them in their true  light. It is important that people should know who and what this M.  Bonaparte is. At the present moment, thanks to the suppression of the  platform, thanks to the suppression of the press, thanks to the  suppression of speech, of liberty, and of truth,--a suppression which  has had for one result the permitting M. Bonaparte to do everything,  but which has had at the same time the effect of nullifying all his  measures without exception, including the indescribable ballot of the  20th of December,--thanks, we say, to this stifling of all complaints  and of all light, no man, no fact wears its true aspect or bears its  true name. M. Bonaparte's crime is not a crime, it is called a  necessity; M. Bonaparte's ambuscade is not an ambuscade, it is called a  defence of public order; M. Bonaparte's robberies are not robberies,  they are called measures of state; M. Bonaparte's murders are not  murders, they are called public safety; M. Bonaparte's accomplices are  not malefactors, they are called magistrates, senators, and councillors  of state; M. Bonaparte's adversaries are not the soldiers of the law  and of right, they are called Jacquerie, demagogues, communists. In the  eyes of France, in the eyes of Europe, the 2nd of December is still  masked. This book is a hand issuing from the darkness, and tearing that  mask away.    Now, we propose to scrutinize this triumph of order, to depict this  government so vigorous, so firm, so well-based, so strong, having on  its side a crowd of paltry youths, who have more ambition than boots,  dandies and beggars; sustained on the Bourse by Fould the Jew, and in  the Church by Montalembert the Catholic; esteemed by women who would  fain pass for maids, by men who want to be prefects; resting on a  coalition of prostitutions; giving fetes; making cardinals; wearing  white neck-cloths and yellow kid gloves, like Morny, newly varnished  like Maupas, freshly brushed like Persigny,--rich, elegant, clean,  gilded, joyous, and born in a pool of blood!    Yes, men will awaken!    Yes, men will arouse from that torpor which, to such a people, is  shame; and when France does awaken, when she does open her eyes, when  she does distinguish, when she does see that which is before her and  beside her, she will recoil with a terrible shudder from the monstrous  crime which dared to espouse her in the darkness, and of which she has  shared the bed.    Then will the supreme hour strike!    The sceptics smile and insist; they say:    \"Hope for nothing. This government, you say, is the shame of France. Be  it so, but this same shame is quoted on the Bourse. Hope for nothing.  You are poets and dreamers if you hope. Why, look about you: the  tribune, the press, intelligence, speech, thought, all that was  liberty, has vanished. Yesterday, these things were in motion, alive;  to-day, they are petrified. Well, people are satisfied with this  petrification, they accommodate themselves to it, make the most of it,  conduct business on it, and live as usual. Society goes on, and plenty  of worthy folk are well pleased with this state of things. Why do you  want to change it, to put an end to it? Don't deceive yourselves, it is  all solid, all firm; it is the present and the future.\"    We are in Russia. The Neva is frozen over. Houses are built on the ice,  and heavy chariots roll over it. It is no longer water, but rock. The  people go to and fro upon this marble which was once a river. A town is  run up, streets are marked out, shops opened; people buy, sell, eat,  drink, sleep, light fires on what once was water.
