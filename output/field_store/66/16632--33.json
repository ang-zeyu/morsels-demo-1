There's scarlet holly on the streets, and silver mistletoe;       The surging, jeweled, ragged crowds forever come and go.       And here a silken woman laughs, and there a beggar asks--       And, oh, the faces, tense of lip, like mad and mocking masks.       Who thinks of Bethlehem today, and one lone winter night?       Who knows that in a manger-bed there breathed a Child of Light?         There's fragrant scent of evergreen upon the chilling air;       There's tinsel tawdriness revealed beneath the sunlight's glare;       There's Want and Plenty, Greed and Pride--a hundred thousand souls,       And, oh, the weary eyes of them, like dull and sullen coals.         Who knows the town of Bethlehem, once gleamed beneath the star,         Whose wondrous light the shepherds saw watching their flocks afar?         And yet above the city streets, above the noise and whir,       There seems to come a fragrant breath of frankincense and myrrh.       I saw a woman, bent and wan, and on her face a light       The look that Mary might have worn that other Christmas night.         And as the little children passed, and one lad turned and smiled,         I saw within his wistful eyes the spirit of the Child.         --_Caroline Reynolds._    And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field,  keeping watch over their flock by night. And, lo, the angel of the  Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them;  and they were sore afraid.    And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good  tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is  born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the  Lord.    And this shall be a sign unto you: Ye shall find the babe wrapped in  swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.    And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host  praising God, and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth  peace, good will toward men.    And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into  heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto  Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord  hath made known to us.    And they came with haste, and found Mary and Joseph, and the babe  lying in a manger. (_Exit_ PROLOGUE _at L._)    (_Soft chimes are heard. The_ SHEPHERDS, _accompanied by the concealed  choir, are heard singing:_)         LEAD, KINDLY LIGHT         Lead, kindly Light, amid th' encircling gloom,           Lead Thou me on!       The night is dark and I am far from home;           Lead Thou me on!       Keep Thou my feet, I do not ask to see       The distant scene; one step enough for me.    _As the_ SHEPHERDS _begin on the second stanza of the hymn, the  curtains rise disclosing the same scene as before._ SIMEON, TIMOTHY  _and_ ISAAC _discovered seated in a group at rear center, singing._  THOMAS _stands by his father._         So long Thy pow'r hath blest me, sure it still           Will lead me on       O'er moor and fen, o'er crag and torrent, till           The night is gone,       And with the morn those angel faces smile       Which I have loved long since, and lost a-while.    SIMEON.       Methought I heard a whir of wings on high.    TIMOTHY.       I see naught save the snow and starry sky.    ISAAC.       We've come a long and mighty step today,       From o'er the frosty hills and far away.    THOMAS (_pointing over the manger_).       Look, father, dost thou see that shining star       That seems to stand above the town so far?       'Tis like a wondrous blossom on a stem,       And see, it ever shines o'er Bethlehem!    TIMOTHY.       A brighter star, I'm sure I never saw--       And perfect form, without a speck or flaw.    SIMEON.       A stranger star! It never shone before,       It standeth still above that stable door.    _Enter_ ANNA _and_ RUTH _from rear left._ ANNA _carries a little  lamb._    ANNA (_joining the group_).       Look ye, I've found a little lamb new-born.    TIMOTHY.       Poor little beastie! Wrap him well and warm.    SIMEON.       An ill night to be born in, frost and snow,       Naught but cold skies above, cold earth below.       I marvel any little creature should be born       On such a night.    ANNA.       I found it all forlorn,       Crying beside its mother in the storm.    SIMEON (_comes down a little to right front_).       Hark, I thought I heard a sound of mighty wings!       Listen! Is it the winter sky that sings?    ISAAC (_with the group at rear center_).       Nay, gran'ther, I heard naught. You're old and gray       And weary with the miles you've walked today.    SIMEON.       At noon I met a man who tarried in the shade,       He led a mule, and riding it a maid--       A maiden with a face I'll ne'er forget,       A wondrous face, I seem to see it yet       Lit with an inward shining, as if God       Had set a lighted lamp within her soul.       Many have passed all day, but none like these,       And no face have I ever seen like hers.    TIMOTHY.       Belike the man and maid were strangers here,       And come to Bethlehem at the king's command.    RUTH (_comes down to_ SIMEON _and takes his hand_).       Methinks I met that very man and maid--       A maiden with such wondrous dove-like eyes,       I saw them near this place, all tired and worn,       Trudging about the town, seeking an inn.    SIMEON.       And did they find one?    RUTH.       Nay, not so!       For every inn was crowded to its doors.       Hard by Deborah's inn there is a little barn,       All full of cattle, oxen, cooing doves--       I showed it to them, and they went therein.    THOMAS (_standing at rear L. with_ ANNA).       Mother, that star! That wondrous, wondrous light,    (_Points up._)         It turns the night to day, it shines so bright       I am afraid! It cannot be that any star,       Only a star, can give so great a light.       It frightens me.    ANNA.       All things are strange tonight.       The very sheep are restless in their fold,       They watch the star and do not mind the cold.    SIMEON (_puts hand to right ear, bends toward right and listens_).       Again I heard a singing in the sky!    TIMOTHY.       You heard the tinkling bell of some stray sheep,       The night grows late, come let us all to sleep.    SIMEON.       Yea, all ye lie down and take your rest,       I'll keep the watch alone, this night is blest.    (_The others recline at the rear._)    ANNA (_comes to_ SIMEON).       Here, take the little sheep and keep it warm.    (_Lies down._)    SIMEON.       Poor little new-born beast, I'll guard from harm.       Again I marvel that you should be born       On such a night, poor little lamb forlorn.    (SIMEON _walks toward the manger with the sheep in his arms. The  others sleep._)    The Lord is my shepherd: I shall not want.    He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the  still waters.    He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for  his name's sake.    Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will  fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort  me.    Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou  anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.    Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and  I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.    (_Soft Music._)         Hark! There's music in the wind! And that strange light       There in the east, it brightens all the night!       I seem to hear again the whir of wings,       Awake, awake! It is an angel sings!    (_He arouses the others. They listen wonderingly, standing or  reclining._)    VOICE (_an unseen soprano chants softly_).         Glory to God in the highest!           Fear not!
