To them it was the season of Yule. Bede (_de  temporum ratione_, c. 13), regards it as a term for the winter  solstice. \"Menses Giuli a conversione solis in auctum dici, quia unus  eorum praecedit, alius subsequitur, nomina acceperunt\": alluding to the  Anglo-Saxon Calendar, which designated the months of December and  January as _aeerre-geola_ and _aeftera-geola_, the former and the latter  Yule. Both Skeat and Wedgwood derive it from the old Norse _jol_,  which means feasting and revelry. Mr. J.F. Hodgetts, in an article  entitled \"Paganism in Modern Christianity\" (_Antiquary_, December  1882, p. 257), says:--    \"The ancient name (Yule) for Christmas is still used throughout all  Scandinavia. The Swedes, Danes, and Norwegians wish each other a 'glad  Yule,' as we say 'A merry Christmas to you.' This alone would serve to  draw our attention to Scandinavia, even if no other reason existed for  searching there for the origin of our great Christian Feast. The grand  storehouses of Pagan lore, as far as the Northern nations of Teutonic  race are concerned, are the two Eddas, and if we refer to the part, or  chapter, of Snorri Sturlson's Edda, known as _Gylfa Ginning_, we shall  find the twelfth name of Odin, the Father of the Gods, or Allfather,  given as _Ialg_ or _Ialkr_ (pronounced _yolk_ or _yulg_). The  Christmas tree, introduced into Russia by the Scandinavians, is  called _elka_ (pronounced _yolka_), and in the times just preceding,  and just after, the conquest of Britain by the English, this high  feast of Odin was held in mid-winter, under the name of _Ialka tid_,  or Yule-tide. It was celebrated at this season, because the Vikings,  being then unable to go to sea, could assemble in their great halls  and temples and drink to the gods they served so well. Another reason  was, that it fell towards the end of the twelve mystic months that  made up the mythical, as well as the cosmical, cycle of the year, and  was therefore appropriately designated by the last of the names by  which Odin is called in the Edda.\"    There are different opinions as to the duration of Christ-tide. The  Roman Church holds that Christmas properly begins at Lauds on  Christmas Eve, when the Divine Office begins to be solemnised as a  Double, and refers directly to the Nativity of our Lord. It terminates  on the 13th of January, the Octave day of the Epiphany. The evergreens  and decorations remain in churches and houses until the 2nd of  February, the Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary.    But I think that if we in England are bound by ecclesiastical law as  to the keeping of Christ-tide, it should, at least, be an English  use--such as was observed before the domination of Rome in England.  And, previous to the _Natale_, or Festival of the Nativity, the early  Church ordained a preparatory period of _nine days_, called a  _Novena_. These take the commencement of Christ-tide back to the 16th  December, on which day the Sarum use ordained the Anthem, which  commences, \"O Sapientia, quae ex ore Altissimi prodidisti,\" and at the  present time this day is marked in the Calendar of the English Church  Service Book as \"O Sapientia.\" That this was commonly considered the  commencement of Christ-tide is shown by the following anecdote of the  learned Dr. Parr:--A lady asked him when Christmas commenced, so that  she might know when to begin to eat mince pies. \"Please to say  Christmas pie, madam,\" replied the Doctor. \"Mince pie is  Presbyterian.\" \"Well, Christmas pie--when may we begin to eat them?\"  \"Look in your Prayer-book Calendar for December and there you will  find 'O Sapientia.' Then Christmas pie--not before.\"    The Festival was considered of such high importance by the  Anglo-Saxons that the ordinary Octave was not good enough; it must be  kept up for _twelve_ days. And Collier (_Eccl. Hist._, 1840, vol. i.  p. 285) says that a law passed in the days of King Alfred, \"by virtue  of which the _twelve days_ after the Nativity of our Saviour are made  festivals.\" This brings us to the feast of the Epiphany, 6th January,  or \"Twelfth Day,\" when Christmas ends--for the Epiphany has its own  Octave to follow, and I think the general consensus of opinion is in  favour of this ending.          CHAPTER II         Historic Christ-tides in 790, 878, and 1065--William I.,       1066-1085--William II.--Henry I., 1127--Stephen--Henry II.,       1158-1171--Richard I., 1190--John, 1200--Henry III.,       1253--Edwards I., II., and III.--Richard II.,       1377-1398--Henry IV.-V., 1418--Henry VIII., his magnificent       Christ-tides.      The earliest historic Christmas in England was 790, when the Welsh  suddenly attacked the soldiers of Offa, King of Mercia, who were  celebrating Christ-tide, and slew many of them; and in 878, when  Alfred was doing likewise at Chippenham, that Guthrum and his Danes  fell upon him, destroyed his forces, and sent him a fugitive. In 1065,  at this season, Westminster Abbey was consecrated, but King Edward was  not there, being too ill. Next year, in this same Church of St. Peter,  was William I. crowned on Christmas day by Aldred, archbishop of York;  for he would not receive the crown at the hands of Stigand, archbishop  of Canterbury, \"because he was hated, and furthermore judged to be a  verie lewd person, and a naughtie liver.\" In 1085 he kept his  Christ-tide at Gloucester, where he knighted his son Henry.    William II. followed the example of his father, and kept the festival  in state; as did Henry I. at Westminster, Windsor, and elsewhere. But  that of 1127 at Windsor was somewhat marred by a quarrel between two  prelates. It seems that Thurston, archbishop of York (in prejudice of  the right of William, archbishop of Canterbury), would have set the  crown on the king's head as he was going to hear Mass, but was pushed  back with some violence by the followers of the other archbishop, and  his chaplain, who was bearing the archiepiscopal crozier, was  ignominiously and contemptuously thrust out of doors, cross and all.  The strife did not end there, for both the prelates, together with the  bishop of Lincoln, went to Rome to lay their case before the Pope for  his decision.    Stephen, for a short time, kept Christ-tide royally; but the internal  dissensions of his kingdom prevented him from continuing celebrating  the festival in state. Henry II. kept his first Christ-tide at  Bermondsey, where, to conciliate his subjects, he solemnly promised to  expel all foreigners from England, whereupon some tarried not, but  went incontinently. A curious event happened at Christmas 1158, when  the king, then at Worcester, took the crown from his head and  deposited it on the altar, never wearing it afterwards. In 1171 he  spent the feast at Dublin, where, there being no place large enough,  he built a temporary hall for the accommodation of his suite and  guests, to which latter he taught the delights of civilisation in good  cookery, masquings, and tournaments. The most famous Christ-tide that  we hear of in the reign of Richard I. is that in 1190, when \"the two  Kings of England and France held their Christmasse this yeare at  Messina, and still the King of England used great liberalitie in  bestowing his treasure freelie amongst knights and other men of warre,  so that it was thought he spent more in a moneth than anie of his  predecessours ever spent in a whole yeare.\"    John kept Christ-tide in 1200 at Guildford, \"and there gave to his  servants manie faire liveries and suits of apparell. The archbishop of  Canturburie did also the like at Canturburie, seeming in deed to  strive with the king, which of them should passe the other in such  sumptuous appareling of their men: whereat the king (and not without  good cause) was greatlie mooved to indignation against him, although,  for a time, he coloured the same.\" John took a speedy and very curious  revenge. \"From thence he returned and came to Canturburie, where he  held his Easter, which fell that yeare on the day of the Annunciation  of our Ladie, at which feast he sat crowned, together with his wife,  queen Isabell, _the archbishop of Canturburie bearing the charges of  them and their trains while they remained there_.\" Next year he held  the feast at Argenton in Normandy.    Henry III. celebrated the Nativity right royally in 1253 at York,  \"whither came Alexander the young King of Scots, and was there made  knight by the King of England; and, on Saint Stephan's day, he married  the ladie Margaret, daughter to the King of England, according to the  assurance before time concluded. There was a great assemblie of noble  personages at that feast. The Queene dowager of Scotland, mother to  King Alexander, a Frenchwoman of the house of Coucie, had passed the  sea, and was present there with a faire companie of lords and  gentlemen. The number of knights that were come thither on the King of  England's part were reckoned to be at the point of one thousand. The  King of Scots had with him three score knights, and a great sort of  other gentlemen comparable to knights. The King of Scots did homage to  the King of England, at that time, for the realme of Scotland, and all  things were done with great love and favour, although, at the  beginning, some strife was kindled about taking up"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19980"],[0,"A Joy For Ever (and Its Price in the Market) (#3)"],[1,"to plead with you for the  acceptance of that principle of government or authority which must be at  the root of all economy, whether for use or for pleasure. I said, a few  minutes ago, that a nation's labour, well applied, was amply sufficient  to provide its whole population with good food, comfortable clothing,  and pleasant luxury. But the good, instant, and constant application is  everything. We must not, when our strong hands are thrown out of work,  look wildly about for want of something to do with them. If ever we feel  that want, it is a sign that all our household is out of order. Fancy a  farmer's wife, to whom one or two of her servants should come at twelve  o'clock at noon, crying that they had got nothing to do; that they did  not know what to do next: and fancy still farther, the said farmer's  wife looking hopelessly about her rooms and yard, they being all the  while considerably in disorder, not knowing where to set the spare  handmaidens to work, and at last complaining bitterly that she had been  obliged to give them their dinner for nothing. That's the type of the  kind of political economy we practise too often in England. Would you  not at once assert of such a mistress that she knew nothing of her  duties? and would you not be certain, if the household were rightly  managed, the mistress would be only too glad at any moment to have the  help of any number of spare hands; that she would know in an instant  what to set them to;--in an instant what part of to-morrow's work might  be most serviceably forwarded, what part of next month's work most  wisely provided for, or what new task of some profitable kind  undertaken; and when the evening came, and she dismissed her servants to  their recreation or their rest, or gathered them to the reading round  the work-table, under the eaves in the sunset, would you not be sure to  find that none of them had been overtasked by her, just because none had  been left idle; that everything had been accomplished because all had  been employed; that the kindness of the mistress had aided her presence  of mind, and the slight labour had been entrusted to the weak, and the  formidable to the strong; and that as none had been dishonoured by  inactivity, so none had been broken by toil?      12. Now, the precise counterpart of such a household would be seen in a  nation in which political economy was rightly understood. You complain  of the difficulty of finding work for your men. Depend upon it, the real  difficulty rather is to find men for your work. The serious question for  you is not how many you have to feed, but how much you have to do; it  is our inactivity, not our hunger, that ruins us: let us never fear that  our servants should have a good appetite--our wealth is in their  strength, not in their starvation. Look around this island of yours, and  see what you have to do in it. The sea roars against your harbourless  cliffs--you have to build the breakwater, and dig the port of refuge;  the unclean pestilence ravins in your streets--you have to bring the  full stream from the hills, and to send the free winds through the  thoroughfare; the famine blanches your lips and eats away your  flesh--you have to dig the moor and dry the marsh, to bid the morass  give forth instead of engulfing, and to wring the honey and oil out of  the rock. These things, and thousands such, we have to do, and shall  have to do constantly, on this great farm of ours; for do not suppose  that it is anything else than that. Precisely the same laws of economy  which apply to the cultivation of a farm or an estate, apply to the  cultivation of a province or of an island. Whatever rebuke you would  address to the improvident master of an ill-managed patrimony,  precisely that rebuke we should address to ourselves, so far as we  leave our population in idleness and our country in disorder. What would  you say to the lord of an estate who complained to you of his poverty  and disabilities, and when you pointed out to him that his land was half  of it overrun with weeds, and that his fences were all in ruin, and that  his cattle-sheds were roofless, and his labourers lying under the hedges  faint for want of food, he answered to you that it would ruin him to  weed his land or to roof his sheds--that those were too costly  operations for him to undertake, and that he knew not how to feed his  labourers nor pay them? Would you not instantly answer, that instead of  ruining him to weed his fields, it would save him; that his inactivity  was his destruction, and that to set his labourers to work was to feed  them? Now, you may add acre to acre, and estate to estate, as far as you  like, but you will never reach a compass of ground which shall escape  from the authority of these simple laws. The principles which are right  in the administration of a few fields, are right also in the  administration of a great country from horizon to horizon: idleness  does not cease to be ruinous because it is extensive, nor labour to be  productive because it is universal.      13. Nay, but you reply, there is one vast difference between the  nation's economy and the private man's: the farmer has full authority  over his labourers; he can direct them to do what is needed to be done,  whether they like it or not; and he can turn them away if they refuse to  work, or impede others in their working, or are disobedient, or  quarrelsome. There _is_ this great difference; it is precisely this  difference on which I wish to fix your attention, for it is precisely  this difference which you have to do away with. We know the necessity of  authority in farm, or in fleet, or in army; but we commonly refuse to  admit it in the body of the nation. Let us consider this point a little.      14. In the various awkward and unfortunate efforts which the French have  made at the development of a social system, they have at least stated  one true principle, that of fraternity or brotherhood. Do not be  alarmed; they got all wrong in their experiments, because they quite  forgot that this fact of fraternity implied another fact quite as  important--that of paternity, or fatherhood. That is to say, if they  were to regard the nation as one family, the condition of unity in that  family consisted no less in their having a head, or a father, than in  their being faithful and affectionate members, or brothers. But we must  not forget this, for we have long confessed it with our lips, though we  refuse to confess it in our lives. For half an hour every Sunday we  expect a man in a black gown, supposed to be telling us truth, to  address us as brethren, though we should be shocked at the notion of any  brotherhood existing among us out of church. And we can hardly read a  few sentences on any political subject without running a chance of  crossing the phrase \"paternal government,\" though we should be utterly  horror-struck at the idea of governments claiming anything like a  father's authority over us. Now, I believe those two formal phrases are  in both instances perfectly binding and accurate, and that the image of  the farm and its servants which I have hitherto used, as expressing a  wholesome national organization, fails only of doing so, not because it  is too domestic, but because it is not domestic enough; because the real  type of a well-organized nation must be presented, not by a farm  cultivated by servants who wrought for hire, and might be turned away if  they refused to labour, but by a farm in which the master was a father,  and in which all the servants were sons; which implied, therefore, in  all its regulations, not merely the order of expediency, but the bonds  of affection and responsibilities of relationship; and in which all acts  and services were not only to be sweetened by brotherly concord, but to  be enforced by fatherly authority.[2]    [Note 2: See note 1st, in Addenda.]    15. Observe, I do not mean in the least that we ought to place such an  authority in the hands of any one person, or of any class or body of  persons. But I do mean to say that as an individual who conducts himself  wisely must make laws for himself which at some time or other may appear  irksome or injurious, but which, precisely at the time they appear most  irksome, it is most necessary he should obey, so a nation which means to  conduct itself wisely, must establish authority over itself, vested  either in kings, councils, or laws, which it must resolve to obey, even  at times when the law or authority appears irksome to the body of the  people, or injurious to certain masses of it. And this kind of national  law has hitherto been only judicial; contented, that is, with an  endeavour to prevent and punish violence and crime: but, as we advance  in our social knowledge, we shall endeavour to make our government  paternal as well as judicial; that is, to establish such laws and  authorities as may at once direct us in our occupations, protect us  against our follies, and visit us in our distresses: a government which  shall repress dishonesty, as now it punishes theft; which shall show how  the discipline of the masses may be brought to aid the toils of peace,  as discipline of the masses has hitherto knit the sinews of battle; a  government which shall have its soldiers of the ploughshare as well as  its soldiers of the sword, and which shall distribute more proudly its  golden crosses of industry--golden as the glow of the harvest, than now  it grants its bronze crosses of honour--bronzed with the crimson of  blood.      16. I have not, of course, time to insist on the nature or details of  government of this kind; only I wish to plead for your several and  future consideration of this one truth, that the notion of Discipline  and Interference lies at the very root of all human progress or power;  that the \"Let-alone\" principle is, in all things which man has to do  with, the principle of death; that it is ruin "]]]
