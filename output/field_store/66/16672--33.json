BASLE    One Hour in Advance      Basle was once surrounded by enemies, and very hard pressed on all  sides. A troop of discontented citizens made a shameful compact with  the besiegers to help them to conquer the town. It was arranged one  dark night that exactly as the clock was striking twelve the attack  was to be made from within and without. The traitors were all ready,  waiting for midnight in great excitement, having no evil presentiments  of what was about to happen.    The expected hour approached. Accidentally the watchman of the tower  heard of the proposed attack, and no time being left to warn the  commander of the garrison or the guard, he quickly and with great  presence of mind determined upon a safe expedient; he put forward the  hand of the great clock one hour, so that instead of striking  midnight, the clock struck one.    The traitors in the town looked at each other aghast, believing the  enemies outside had neglected or perhaps betrayed them. General doubt  and misunderstanding reigned in both camps. While they were debating  what plan they must now adopt, the sharp-witted watchman had time to  communicate with the magistrate and with the governor of the town. The  alarm was raised, the citizens warned, and the treacherous plan  completely wrecked. The enemy at last, tired of the useless siege,  retired discouraged.    The magistrate in remembrance of this remarkable deed ordered that the  town-clock should remain in advance as the courageous watchman had set  it that eventful night. This singular regulation continued till the  year 1798, and although the honest inhabitants of Basle were, as  talkative tongues asserted, a century behind-hand in everything else,  yet with regard to time they were always one hour in advance.          CASTLE NIEDECK    The Toy of the young Giantess      [Illustration: Das Riesenspielzeug--Nach dem Gemaelde von Cnopf--The  Giant's Toy--Les jouets des geants]    In olden times a race of giants is said to have lived in Alsace.  Castle Niedeck in the valley of the Breusch was their residence, but  even the ruins of this fortress have long since disappeared. The  legend however remains to tell us that they were a peaceable people,  well disposed to mankind.    The daughter of the master of the castle was one day leisurely walking  through the adjoining wood. On approaching the fields and meadows of  the valley, she perceived a peasant ploughing. The young giantess  looked in great astonishment at the tiny man who seemed to be so  busily engaged trudging along after his little team, and turning up  the ground with his small iron instrument. She had never before seen  anything so wonderful and was very much amused at the sight.    It seemed to her a nice little toy, and she clapped her hands in  childish glee, so that the echo sounded among the mountains; then  picking up man, horse, and plough, she placed them in her apron and  hurried back gaily to the castle. There she showed her father the  nice little toy, greatly pleased at what she had found.    The giant however shook his enormous head gravely, and said in a  displeased tone, \"Don't you know, child, who this trembling little  creature with his struggling tiny animal is, that you have chosen for  a plaything? Of all the dwarfs down in the valley below, he is the  most useful; he works hard and indefatigably in scorching heat as well  as in windy cold weather, so that the fields may produce fruit for us.  He who scoffs at or maltreats him will be punished by Heaven. Take the  little labourer therefore back to the place he came from.\"    The young giantess, greatly ashamed and deeply blushing with  embarrassment, put the amusing little toy back into her apron, and  carried it obediently down to the valley.          STRASSBURG    The Cathedral Clock      The Cathedral was finished, and the city magistrates resolved to place  an ingenious clock on the upper tower. For a long time they searched  in vain, but at last a master was found who offered to create a work  of art such as had never been seen in any land. The members of the  council were highly satisfied with this proposal, and the master began  his work.    Weeks and months passed, and when at last it was finished there was  general astonishment; the clock was indeed so wonderful that nothing  to match it could be found in the whole country. It marked not only  the hours but the days and months as well; a globe was attached to it  which also marked out the rising and the setting of the sun, and the  eclipses of that body and the moon could be seen at the same time as  they took place in nature. Every change was pointed out by Mercury's  wand, and every constellation appeared at the right time. Shortly  before the stroke of the clock a figure representing Death emerged  from the centre and sounded the full hour, while at the quarter and  half hours the statue of Christ came forth, repelling the destroyer  of all life. Added to all these wonders was a beautiful chime that  played melodious hymns.    Such was the marvellous clock in the cathedral of Strassburg. The  magistrates however proved themselves unworthy of their new  possession; pride and presumption got the better of them, making them  commit a most unjust and ungrateful action.    They desired their town to be the only one in the land which possessed  such a work of art, and in order to prevent the maker from making  another like it, they did not shrink from the vilest of crimes.    Taking advantage of the rumour that such a wonderful work could only  have been made by the aid of witchcraft, they accused the clock-maker  of being united with the devil, threw him into prison, and cruelly  condemned him to be blinded. The unhappy artist resigned himself to  his bitter fate without a murmur. The only favour he asked was that he  might be allowed to examine the clock once again before the judgment  was carried out. He said he wanted to arrange something in the works  which no one else could understand.    The crafty magistrates, being anxious to have the clock perfect,  granted him this request.    The artist filed, sawed, regulated here and there, and then was led  away, and in the same hour deprived of his sight.    The cruel deed was hardly accomplished, when it was found that the  clock had stopped. The artist had destroyed his work with his own  hands; his righteous determination that the chimes would never ring  again, had become a melancholy truth. Up to the present no one has  been able again to set the dead works going. An equally splendid clock  now adorns the cathedral, but the remains of the first one have been  preserved ever since.          The little Man at the Angel's Pillar      Close to the famous clock in the Cathedral of Strassburg, there is a  little man in stone gazing up at the angel's pillar which supports the  south wing of the cathedral. Long ago the little man who is now  sculptured in stone, stood there in flesh and blood. He used to stare  up at the pillar with a criticising eye from top to bottom and again  from bottom to top. Then he would shake his head doubtfully each time.    It happened once that a sculptor passed the cathedral and saw the  little man looking up, evidently comparing the proportions of the  pillar.    \"It seems to me you are finding fault with the pillar, my good  fellow,\" the stone-cutter remarked, and the little man nodded with a  self-satisfied look.    \"Well, what do you think of it? Speak out my man,\" said the master,  tapping the fellow's shoulder encouragingly.    \"The pillar is certainly splendid,\" began the latter slowly, \"the  Apostles, the angels, and the Saviour are most beautiful too. But  there is one thing troubling me. That slender pillar cannot support  that heavy vault much longer; it will soon totter and fall down, and  all will go to pieces.\"    The sculptor looked alternately at the work of art and at its strange  fault-finder. A contemptuous smile passed over his features.    \"You are quite convinced of the truth of your statement, aren't you?\"  asked he enquiringly.    The bold critic repeated his doubts with an important air.    \"Well,\" cried the stone-cutter, with comical earnestness, \"then you  will remain there always, gazing at the pillar until it sinks down,  crushed by the vault.\"    He went straight off into his workshop, seized hammer and chisel, and  formed the little man into stone just as he was, looking upwards with  a knowing face and an important air.    This little figure is still there at the present day with both hands  leaning on the balustrade of St. Nicholas' chapel, awaiting the  expected fall of the pillar, and most likely he will remain there for  many a century to come.          WORMS    The Nibelungen Lied      [Illustration: Siegfried auf der Totenbahre--Nach dem Gemaelde von Emil  Lauffer]    To-day we are deeply touched, as our forefathers must have been, at  the recital of the boundless suffering and the overwhelming  concatenation of sin and expiation in the lives of the Recken and  Frauen of the Nibelungen Legend. That naive singer has remained  nameless and unknown, who about the end of the 12th century wrote down  this legend in poetic form, thus preserving forever our most precious  relic of Germanic Folksepic. A powerful story it is of sin and  suffering: corresponding to the world itself and just as the primitive  mind of a people loves to represent it. The story begins as a lovely  idyll but ends in gloomy tragedy.    The ancient Rhenish town of Worms was during the great migrations the  seat of authority of the Burgundian invaders, an east Germanic stock.  During the glorious reign of King Gunther there appears, attracted by  the beauty of Chriemhild the king's sister, a young hero, Siegfried,  by name.
