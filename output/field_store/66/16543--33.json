[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1874"],[0,"The Railway Children (#3)"],[1,"foreign children that she's going to  governess!\" whispered Phyllis. \"I wouldn't be them for anything!\"    At first they enjoyed looking out of the window, but when it grew dusk  they grew sleepier and sleepier, and no one knew how long they had been  in the train when they were roused by Mother's shaking them gently and  saying:--    \"Wake up, dears. We're there.\"    They woke up, cold and melancholy, and stood shivering on the draughty  platform while the baggage was taken out of the train. Then the engine,  puffing and blowing, set to work again, and dragged the train away. The  children watched the tail-lights of the guard's van disappear into the  darkness.    This was the first train the children saw on that railway which was in  time to become so very dear to them. They did not guess then how they  would grow to love the railway, and how soon it would become the centre  of their new life, nor what wonders and changes it would bring to them.  They only shivered and sneezed and hoped the walk to the new house would  not be long. Peter's nose was colder than he ever remembered it to have  been before. Roberta's hat was crooked, and the elastic seemed tighter  than usual. Phyllis's shoe-laces had come undone.    \"Come,\" said Mother, \"we've got to walk. There aren't any cabs here.\"    The walk was dark and muddy. The children stumbled a little on the rough  road, and once Phyllis absently fell into a puddle, and was picked up  damp and unhappy. There were no gas-lamps on the road, and the road was  uphill. The cart went at a foot's pace, and they followed the gritty  crunch of its wheels. As their eyes got used to the darkness, they could  see the mound of boxes swaying dimly in front of them.    A long gate had to be opened for the cart to pass through, and after  that the road seemed to go across fields--and now it went down hill.  Presently a great dark lumpish thing showed over to the right.    \"There's the house,\" said Mother. \"I wonder why she's shut the  shutters.\"    \"Who's SHE?\" asked Roberta.    \"The woman I engaged to clean the place, and put the furniture straight  and get supper.\"    There was a low wall, and trees inside.    \"That's the garden,\" said Mother.    \"It looks more like a dripping-pan full of black cabbages,\" said Peter.    The cart went on along by the garden wall, and round to the back of the  house, and here it clattered into a cobble-stoned yard and stopped at  the back door.    There was no light in any of the windows.    Everyone hammered at the door, but no one came.    The man who drove the cart said he expected Mrs. Viney had gone home.    \"You see your train was that late,\" said he.    \"But she's got the key,\" said Mother. \"What are we to do?\"    \"Oh, she'll have left that under the doorstep,\" said the cart man;  \"folks do hereabouts.\" He took the lantern off his cart and stooped.    \"Ay, here it is, right enough,\" he said.    He unlocked the door and went in and set his lantern on the table.    \"Got e'er a candle?\" said he.    \"I don't know where anything is.\" Mother spoke rather less cheerfully  than usual.    He struck a match. There was a candle on the table, and he lighted it.  By its thin little glimmer the children saw a large bare kitchen with  a stone floor. There were no curtains, no hearth-rug. The kitchen  table from home stood in the middle of the room. The chairs were in one  corner, and the pots, pans, brooms, and crockery in another. There was  no fire, and the black grate showed cold, dead ashes.    As the cart man turned to go out after he had brought in the boxes,  there was a rustling, scampering sound that seemed to come from inside  the walls of the house.    \"Oh, what's that?\" cried the girls.    \"It's only the rats,\" said the cart man. And he went away and shut the  door, and the sudden draught of it blew out the candle.    \"Oh, dear,\" said Phyllis, \"I wish we hadn't come!\" and she knocked a  chair over.    \"ONLY the rats!\" said Peter, in the dark.        Chapter II. Peter's coal-mine.      \"What fun!\" said Mother, in the dark, feeling for the matches on the  table. \"How frightened the poor mice were--I don't believe they were  rats at all.\"    She struck a match and relighted the candle and everyone looked at each  other by its winky, blinky light.    \"Well,\" she said, \"you've often wanted something to happen and now it  has. This is quite an adventure, isn't it? I told Mrs. Viney to get us  some bread and butter, and meat and things, and to have supper ready. I  suppose she's laid it in the dining-room. So let's go and see.\"    The dining-room opened out of the kitchen. It looked much darker than  the kitchen when they went in with the one candle. Because the kitchen  was whitewashed, but the dining-room was dark wood from floor to  ceiling, and across the ceiling there were heavy black beams. There was  a muddled maze of dusty furniture--the breakfast-room furniture from  the old home where they had lived all their lives. It seemed a very long  time ago, and a very long way off.    There was the table certainly, and there were chairs, but there was no  supper.    \"Let's look in the other rooms,\" said Mother; and they looked. And in  each room was the same kind of blundering half-arrangement of furniture,  and fire-irons and crockery, and all sorts of odd things on the floor,  but there was nothing to eat; even in the pantry there were only a rusty  cake-tin and a broken plate with whitening mixed in it.    \"What a horrid old woman!\" said Mother; \"she's just walked off with the  money and not got us anything to eat at all.\"    \"Then shan't we have any supper at all?\" asked Phyllis, dismayed,  stepping back on to a soap-dish that cracked responsively.    \"Oh, yes,\" said Mother, \"only it'll mean unpacking one of those big  cases that we put in the cellar. Phil, do mind where you're walking to,  there's a dear. Peter, hold the light.\"    The cellar door opened out of the kitchen. There were five wooden steps  leading down. It wasn't a proper cellar at all, the children thought,  because its ceiling went up as high as the kitchen's. A bacon-rack hung  under its ceiling. There was wood in it, and coal. Also the big cases.    Peter held the candle, all on one side, while Mother tried to open the  great packing-case. It was very securely nailed down.    \"Where's the hammer?\" asked Peter.    \"That's just it,\" said Mother. \"I'm afraid it's inside the box. But  there's a coal-shovel--and there's the kitchen poker.\"    And with these she tried to get the case open.    \"Let me do it,\" said Peter, thinking he could do it better himself.  Everyone thinks this when he sees another person stirring a fire, or  opening a box, or untying a knot in a bit of string.    \"You'll hurt your hands, Mammy,\" said Roberta; \"let me.\"    \"I wish Father was here,\" said Phyllis; \"he'd get it open in two shakes.  What are you kicking me for, Bobbie?\"    \"I wasn't,\" said Roberta.    Just then the first of the long nails in the packing-case began to come  out with a scrunch. Then a lath was raised and then another, till all  four stood up with the long nails in them shining fiercely like iron  teeth in the candle-light.    \"Hooray!\" said Mother; \"here are some candles--the very first thing! You  girls go and light them. You'll find some saucers and things. Just drop  a little candle-grease in the saucer and stick the candle upright in  it.\"    \"How many shall we light?\"    \"As many as ever you like,\" said Mother, gaily. \"The great thing is  to be cheerful. Nobody can be cheerful in the dark except owls and  dormice.\"    So the girls lighted candles. The head of the first match flew off and  stuck to Phyllis's finger; but, as Roberta said, it was only a little  burn, and she might have had to be a Roman martyr and be burned whole if  she had happened to live in the days when those things were fashionable.    Then, when the dining-room was lighted by fourteen candles, Roberta  fetched coal and wood and lighted a fire.    \"It's very cold for May,\" she said, feeling what a grown-up thing it was  to say.    The fire-light and the candle-light made the dining-room look very  different, for now you could see that the dark walls were of wood,  carved here and there into little wreaths and loops.    The girls hastily 'tidied' the room, which meant putting the chairs  against the wall, and piling all the odds and ends into a corner and  partly hiding them with the big leather arm-chair that Father used to  sit in after dinner.    \"Bravo!\" cried Mother, coming in with a tray full of things. \"This is  something like! I'll just get a tablecloth and then--\"    The tablecloth was in a box with a proper lock that was opened with a  key and not with a shovel, and when the cloth was spread on the table, a  real feast was laid out on it.    Everyone was very, very tired, but everyone cheered up at the sight of  the funny and delightful supper. There were biscuits, the Marie and the  plain kind, sardines, preserved ginger, cooking raisins, and candied  peel and marmalade.    \"What a good thing Aunt Emma packed up all the odds and ends out of the  Store cupboard,\" said Mother. \"Now, Phil, DON'T put the marmalade spoon  in among the sardines.\"    \"No, I won't, Mother,\" said Phyllis, and put it down among the Marie  biscuits.    \"Let's drink Aunt Emma's health,\" said Roberta, suddenly; \"what should  we have done if she hadn't packed up these things? Here's to Aunt Emma!\"    And the toast was drunk in ginger wine and water, out of  willow-patterned tea-cups, because the glasses couldn't be found.    They all felt that they had been a little hard on Aunt Emma. She wasn't  a nice cuddly person like Mother, but after all it was she who had  thought of packing up the odds and ends of things to eat.    It was Aunt Emma, too, who had aired all the sheets ready; and the men  who had moved the furniture had put the bedsteads together, so the beds  were soon made.    \"Good night, chickies,\" said Mother. \"I'm"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18751"],[0,"A Text-book of Assaying: For the Use of Those Connected with Mines.

Assaying has for its object the determination of the quantities of those  constituents of a material which add to or detract from its value in the  arts and manufactures. The methods of assaying are mainly those of  analytical chemistry, and are limited by various practical  considerations to the determination of the constituents of a small  parcel, which is frequently only a few grains, and rarely more than a  few ounces, in weight. From these determinations calculations are made,  which have reference to a mass of material of, perhaps, hundreds of  tons. But in all cases, whether the mass under consideration be large or  small, whether the material be obtained by mining, grown, or  manufactured, the assayer is supposed to receive a small quantity,  called \"the sample,\" which is, or ought to be, the exact counterpart of  the mass of material that is being dealt with. The taking and making of  this sample is termed \"sampling\"; and the men whose special work it is  to select such samples are \"the samplers.\"    But although \"sampling\" is thus distinct from \"assaying,\" the assayer  should be familiar with the principles of sampling, and rigorous in the  application of these principles in the selecting, from the sample sent  him, that smaller portion upon which he performs his operations.    ~Sampling.~--_In the case of gases_, there is absolutely no trouble in  mixing. The only difficulty is in drawing off a fair sample where, as in  flues, the body of the gas is in motion, and varies a little in  composition from time to time. In this case, care must be taken to draw  off uniformly a sufficient volume of the gas during a prolonged period;  any portion of this larger volume may then be taken for the analytical  operation.    _In the case of liquids_, which mix more or less easily--and this class  includes metals, &c., in the state of fusion--more or less severe  agitation, followed by the immediate withdrawal of a portion, will yield  a fairly representative sample.    _In the case of solids_, the whole mass must be crushed, and, if not  already of fairly uniform quality, mixed, before sampling can take  place. Most of the material which a sampler is called upon to deal with,  is, however, in a more or less divided state and fairly uniform. In  practice it is assumed that 5 per cent. of the whole (= 1/20th), if  taken in portions of equal weight and at frequent and regular intervals,  will represent the mass from which it was taken. Taking a heap of ore,  A, and selecting one out of every twenty spade-, bag-, barrow-, or  wagon-fuls, according to the quantity of stuff in the heap, there is  obtained a second heap, B, containing one-twentieth of the stuff of the  heap A. If we crush the stuff in B until this heap contains  approximately the same number of stones as A did--which means, crushing  every stone in B into about twenty pieces--B will become the counterpart  of A. Selecting in the same manner 5 per cent. of B, there is got a  third heap, C. This alternate reduction and pulverising must be carried  on until a sample of suitable size is obtained. This may be expressed  very clearly thus:--         A  =  1000     tons of rocks and lumpy ore.       B  =    50      \"   \"  rough stones,  1/20th of A.       C  =     2.5    \"   \"  small stones,  1/20th of B.       D  =     0.125  \"   \"  coarse powder, 1/20th of C.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.    CONE    PARTLY REDUCED CONE    PLAN OF FRUSTRUM DIVIDED.    ELEVATION OF FRUSTRUM DIVIDED.]    If the material to be sampled is already a dry powder, 5 per cent. of it  should be heaped in a cone; each lot being added on the apex of the  cone already formed, so that it may distribute itself by falling evenly  in all directions. When the cone is completed, convert it into a low  frustrum of a cone by drawing stuff uniformly and in a direct line from  the centre to the circumference. Draw two diameters at right angles to  each other, and reserving any two alternate quarters, reject the others.  Mix; and form another cone, and proceed until a sample is got of the  bulk required.    This is the usual plan, and all samples should be treated in this way  when the stuff is fine enough to fall evenly down the sides of a cone.    Samples as they reach the assay office are seldom in a fit state for the  work of the assayer; they are generally too coarse, and ought always to  be more than he wants for any particular determination. The portion he  requires should never be taken at hap-hazard; the sample must be reduced  systematically to the quantity required.    1. _If the sample is a liquid:_ it is sufficient to shake the bottle,  and take out a measured or weighed quantity for the assay.    2. _If a liquid with a solid in suspension:_ measure the whole of it.  Filter. Make up the filtrate with the wash-water or water to the  original bulk. Assay it. Dry and weigh the residue, and make a separate  assay of it.    3. _If of a creamy consistency, free from heavy particles:_ mix well;  spread out evenly on a glazed tile. Take up equal portions at equal  distances. Mix and assay.    4. _If a mud of coarse and fine particles, or of particles of unequal  density:_ weigh and transfer to a porcelain dish, or weigh in the dish.  Dry at 100° C., weigh. Treat the residue as a solid capable of being  powdered.    5. _If a solid capable of being powdered, or already powdered:_ heap up  into a cone; flatten with a spatula; divide along two diameters at right  angles, and carefully reject the whole of two alternate quarters,  brushing away any fine powder. Mix the other quarters, and repeat (if  necessary). For small quantities a fine state of division is essential.    6. _If a solid with metallic particles:_ powder and pass through a  sieve; the metallic particles will not pass through. Weigh both portions  and assay separately. _Sifting should be followed by a very thorough  mixing._    7. _If a metal or alloy in bar or ingot:_ clean the upper surface of the  bar, and bore through the bar. Use the borings. If the ingot or bar is  small, cut it through and file the section. Filings must be freed from  fragments of the file by means of a magnet; and from oil, if any be  present, by washing with a suitable solvent.[1] Where practicable,  metals and alloys are best sampled by melting and granulating. The  student must carefully avoid any chance of mixing dirt or particles of  other samples with the particular sample which he is preparing. One ore  should be done at a time, and when finished, it should be labelled and  wrapped up, or bottled, before starting on a fresh sample.    When an ore requires to be very finely ground in an agate mortar, it is  often advisable to mix with a little pure alcohol and rub until free  from grit; dry at 100° C. and mix well before weighing.    When an assay is required of a quantity of ore made up of parcels of  different weight and quality, each parcel should be separately sampled  and parts of each sample, bearing to each other the same proportion by  weight as the original parcels, should be taken and mixed. For example,  a lot of ore is made up of one parcel of A, 570 tons, one of B, 180  tons, and another of C, 50 tons; a sample representing the whole may be  got by mixing 57 parts of a sample of A with 18 parts of a sample of B,  and 5 parts of a sample of C.    [Illustration: FIG. 2.]    A bruising plate, like that in fig. 2, is convenient for general office  work. The slab is of cast iron, about an inch thick. It is firmly  supported on a solid block of wood, and pivoted for convenience in  emptying. The bruising-hammer is steel-faced, about 4 inches square, and  1-1/2 inch thick. The block is firmly fixed to a small table or tressel,  so that the slab is about 2 feet 6 inches from the ground. The slab is  cleaned, and the sample collected with the help of a stiff-haired brush.    ~Drying: Determination of Moisture.~--In practice, the moisture is  generally determined by the samplers, and the proportion is specified in  grains per pound on the label attached to the sample when it reaches the  assay office. The method adopted is usually to dry 1 lb. = 7000 grs. of  the ore in a frying-pan heated over a gas flame, or in an ordinary oven,  until a cold bright piece of metal or glass is no longer damped when  held over it. The loss of weight in grains = moisture.    Properly, however, this work should be done by the assayer, if only for  the following reason. It is assumed that the dry ore of the sampler and  of the assayer are the same thing; according to the nature of the ore,  this may or may not be the case. The assayer, however, uses the sample  which he has dried for his moisture-determination, as the dry ore on  which he makes his other assays, and no variation in moisture would  influence the other and more important determinations. Some ores are  sent to the smelter with from"]]]
