The pictures  alone will be of great use in learning the names of feathered  neighbours, while an intelligent study of the text will reveal the  identity of many others.    Local lists of such birds as are found in a neighbourhood, or a county,  are always a great aid in determining, with a fair degree of accuracy,  just what species may or may not be expected to appear in a given  locality.  Such lists are usually first published in _The Auk_, _The  Condor_, or other ornithological publications, and in many cases are  printed and distributed later as separate pamphlets.    There have been published also many State lists of birds, usually  accompanied by detailed information regarding abundance and  distribution of all the species known to occur in the State.   Every  bird {15} student should, if possible, get a copy of his own State bird  book.  Any reader who may wish to learn if such a list of the birds of  his neighbourhood or State has been published is at liberty to address  the question to the author of this book.    _Movements of Birds._--One does not get very far in the work of bird  study without discovering that certain movements are characteristic of  various families; and when the observer is able to recognize this  difference in manner a long step has been taken in acquiring the power  of identifying species.    After watching for a time the actions of a Downy Woodpecker as it  clings to the side of a tree, or hops along its bark, one is quick to  recognize the Woodpecker _manner_ when some other species of that  family is encountered.  Recalling the ceaseless activities of a Yellow  Warbler the observer feels, without quite knowing why, that he has  discovered another Warbler of some kind when a Redstart or  Chestnut-sided Warbler appears.  Once identify a Barn Swallow coursing  through the air, and a long {16} stride is made toward the  identification of the Cliff or Tree Swallow when one swings into view.  The flight of the Flicker, the Goldfinch, the Nighthawk, and the  Sparrow Hawk, is so characteristic in each case that I have often been  able to name the bird for a student upon being told its approximate  size and the character of its flight.  Who can see a Wild Duck  swimming, or a Gull flying, without at once referring it to the group  of birds to which it belongs?  Thus the first step is taken toward  learning the names of the species, and the grouping of them into  families.    _Artificial Cover in Hiding._--When studying the larger or the shyer  species it is sometimes well to hide one's self from view with whatever  articles are at hand that resemble the natural surroundings.  This may  be done by covering with hay if in a field, or by holding some leafy  branches about you if in the woods.    On a lonely island in Pamlico Sound I once got some fishermen to cover  me with sand and sea-shells, and in that way managed to get a close  view of {17} the large flocks of Cormorants that came there to roost  every night.  The island was small and perfectly barren, and any other  method of attempted concealment would have failed utterly.    Another time, while crouched among some boulders watching for a flock  of Gambel's Quails to come to a water-hole in the Santa Catalina  Mountains of Arizona, a Canyon Wren alighted on my back, for I was  covered with an old tent fly so spotted with mildew that it closely  resembled the neighbouring rocks.  A moment later it flew to a point  scarcely more than a foot from my face, when, after one terrified look,  it departed.    [Illustration: A ferocious young eagle]    _The Umbrella Blind._--A device now often used by ornithologists is the  umbrella blind, which is easy to construct.  Take a stout umbrella,  remove the handle, and insert the end in a hollow brass rod five feet  long.  Sharpen the rod at the other end and thrust it into the ground.  Over the raised umbrella throw a dark green cloth cut and sewed so as  to make a curtain that will reach the ground all round.  A {19}  draw-string will make it fit over the top.  Get inside, cut a few  vertical observation slits six inches long, and your work is done.  Erect this within ten feet of a nest, and leave it alone for a few  hours.  The birds will quickly get accustomed to it so that later you  may go inside and watch at close range without disturbing them in the  least.  This blind is often used for close bird photography.  I have  taken pictures of Herring Gulls at a distance of only six feet with the  aid of such a blind.  If you wish to use it on a windy day it may be  stayed by a few guy-lines from the top and sides.    [Illustration: The Umbrella Blind]    The foregoing instructions include all the necessary aids to a beginner  in bird study who desires to start afield properly equipped.  To  summarize them, all that is really necessary is a field glass, a  notebook for memoranda, inconspicuous clothing, and a desire to listen  and learn.    In the next chapter we shall discuss some of the things to be learned  in the study of the life about the nest.    {20}    _NOTE.--The following publications will be found of great aid to the  student in identifying wild birds:_    _\"Handbook of Birds of Eastern North America,\" by Frank M. Chapman,  published by D. Appleton Or Company, price $3.65, postpaid._    _\"Handbook of Birds of Western United States,\" by Florence Merriam  Bailey, published by Houghton, Mifflin Company, price $3.68, postpaid._    _\"Water and Game Birds: Birds of Prey\" and \"Land Birds East of the  Rockies: From Parrots to Blue Birds,\" by Chester A. Reed, published by  Doubleday, Page & Company, price of each in sock cloth, $1.10,  postpaid; inflexible leather, $1.35, postpaid._    _Educational Leaflets, published by the National Association of Audubon  Societies, New York City, a series of nearly one hundred, price 2 cents  each._          {21}    CHAPTER II    THE LIFE ABOUT THE NEST    In view of the fact that birds display much activity about their nests  there is a great advantage in studying the nesting bird.  Once locate  an occupied nest, and by quietly watching for a time, your field glass  and bird guide will usually enable you to learn the owner's name.  If  you do not know where any nest is to be found go out and hunt for one.  This in itself will be an exciting sport, although it should be pursued  with good judgment.  Children unattended should not be permitted to  hunt nests in spring.  A very excellent way to find one is to keep a  sharp watch upon birds at the time when they are engaged in nest  building.    _Nest Hunting._--By noticing every bird suspected of being interested  in domestic affairs, you are pretty {22} sure to see one before long  with grass, twigs, rootlets, or something of the kind in its bill.  Now  watch closely, for you are in a fair way to discover a nest.  The bird  may not go directly to the spot.  If it suspects it is being watched it  may hop from twig to twig and from bush to bush for many minutes before  revealing its secret, and if it becomes very apprehensive it may even  drop its burden and begin a search for insects with the air of one who  had never even dreamed of building a nest.  Even when unsuspicious it  will not always go directly to the nest.  From an outhouse I once  watched a Blue Jay, with a twig, change its perch more than thirty  times before going to the fork where its nest was being built.    Sometimes a bird may be induced to reveal its secret by placing in its  sight tempting nesting material.  By this means Mrs. Pearson last  summer found a Redstart's nest.  Discovering a female industriously  hopping about near the camp, and suspecting what it was seeking, she  dropped some ravellings of a white cotton string from the veranda  railing, letting {23} them fall where the bird could see them.  These  proved most acceptable, and the Redstart immediately appropriated them,  one at a time, with the result that she soon betrayed her nest.    Early morning is the best time of the day to find birds working at  their nests, for then they are most active.  Perhaps a reason for this  is that the broken twigs, leaves, and dead grasses, wet with the dews  of night, are more pliable, and consequently more easily woven into  place.    For nesting sites birds as a rule prefer the open country.   Rolling  meadowlands, with orchards, thickets, and occasional streams, are ideal  places for birds in spring.    _Number and Colour of Eggs._--The full complement of eggs laid by a  bird is known as a set or clutch.  The number varies greatly with  different species.  The Leach's Petrel, Murre, and some other sea  birds, have but one egg.  The Turkey Vulture, Mourning Dove,  Hummingbird, Whip-poor-will, and Nighthawk lay two.  Various Thrushes,  such as the {24} Robin, Veery, and Wood Thrush, deposit from three to  five, four being the most usual number.  Wild Ducks, Turkeys, and  Grouse range from eight to a dozen or more; while Quails sometimes lay  as many as eighteen.    Eggs are variously coloured, and some are so marked that the blending  of their colours with those of their surroundings renders them  inconspicuous.  Thus those of the Killdeer, Sandpiper, and Nighthawk,  for example, are not easily distinguished from the ground on which they  lie.    Many eggs that are laid in holes or other dark places are white without  markings of any kind, as illustrated by those of the Chimney Swift,  Belted Kingfisher, and all Woodpeckers.  In such instances Nature shows  no disposition to be lavish with her colouring matter where it is not  needed.    _Behaviour When Nest Is Discovered._--After the young are hatched it is  even easier to find nests by watching the parents.  The nestlings are  hungry at all hours, and the old ones are visiting the nest at frequent  intervals throughout the day.  Birds {25} behave very differently when"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21012"],[0,"The Loyalists of America and Their Times, Vol. 1 of 2.
