Especially this is to be regretted in the effect produced on the schools  of line engraving, which had reached in England an executive skill of a  kind before unexampled, and which of late have lost much of their more  sterling and legitimate methods. Still, I have seen plates produced  quite recently, more beautiful, I think, in some qualities than anything  ever before attained by the burin: and I have not the slightest fear  that photography, or any other adverse or competitive operation, will in  the least ultimately diminish,--I believe they will, on the contrary,  stimulate and exalt--the grand old powers of the wood and the steel.      11. Such are, I think, briefly the present conditions of art with which  we have to deal; and I conceive it to be the function of this  Professorship, with respect to them, to establish both a practical and  critical school of fine art for English gentlemen: practical, so that if  they draw at all, they may draw rightly; and critical, so that being  first directed to such works of existing art as will best reward their  study, they may afterwards make their patronage of living artists  delightful to themselves in their consciousness of its justice, and, to  the utmost, beneficial to their country, by being given to the men who  deserve it; in the early period of their lives, when they both need it  most, and can be influenced by it to the best advantage.      12. And especially with reference to this function of patronage, I  believe myself justified in taking into account future probabilities as  to the character and range of art in England: and I shall endeavour at  once to organise with you a system of study calculated to develop  chiefly the knowledge of those branches in which the English schools  have shown, and are likely to show, peculiar excellence.    Now, in asking your sanction both for the nature of the general plans I  wish to adopt, and for what I conceive to be necessary limitations of  them, I wish you to be fully aware of my reasons for both: and I will  therefore risk the burdening of your patience while I state the  directions of effort in which I think English artists are liable to  failure, and those also in which past experience has shown they are  secure of success.      13. I referred, but now, to the effort we are making to improve the  designs of our manufactures. Within certain limits I believe this  improvement may indeed take effect: so that we may no more humour  momentary fashions by ugly results of chance instead of design; and may  produce both good tissues, of harmonious colours, and good forms and  substance of pottery and glass. But we shall never excel in decorative  design. Such design is usually produced by people of great natural  powers of mind, who have no variety of subjects to employ themselves on,  no oppressive anxieties, and are in circumstances either of natural  scenery or of daily life, which cause pleasurable excitement. _We_  cannot design, because we have too much to think of, and we think of it  too anxiously. It has long been observed how little real anxiety exists  in the minds of the partly savage races which excel in decorative art;  and we must not suppose that the temper of the Middle Ages was a  troubled one, because every day brought its danger or its change. The  very eventfulness of the life rendered it careless, as generally is  still the case with soldiers and sailors. Now, when there are great  powers of thought, and little to think of, all the waste energy and  fancy are thrown into the manual work, and you have so much intellect as  would direct the affairs of a large mercantile concern for a day, spent  all at once, quite unconsciously, in drawing an ingenious spiral.    Also, powers of doing fine ornamental work are only to be reached by a  perpetual discipline of the hand as well as of the fancy; discipline as  attentive and painful as that which a juggler has to put himself  through, to overcome the more palpable difficulties of his profession.  The execution of the best artists is always a splendid tour-de-force;  and much that in painting is supposed to be dependent on material is  indeed only a lovely and quite inimitable legerdemain. Now, when powers  of fancy, stimulated by this triumphant precision of manual dexterity,  descend uninterruptedly from generation to generation, you have at last,  what is not so much a trained artist, as a new species of animal, with  whose instinctive gifts you have no chance of contending. And thus all  our imitations of other people's work are futile. We must learn first to  make honest English wares, and afterwards to decorate them as may please  the then approving Graces.      14. Secondly--and this is an incapacity of a graver kind, yet having its  own good in it also--we shall never be successful in the highest fields  of ideal or theological art.    For there is one strange, but quite essential, character in us: ever  since the Conquest, if not earlier:--a delight in the forms of burlesque  which are connected in some degree with the foulness of evil. I think  the most perfect type of a true English mind in its best possible  temper, is that of Chaucer; and you will find that, while it is for the  most part full of thoughts of beauty, pure and wild like that of an  April morning, there are even in the midst of this, sometimes  momentarily jesting passages which stoop to play with evil--while the  power of listening to and enjoying the jesting of entirely gross  persons, whatever the feeling may be which permits it, afterwards  degenerates into forms of humour which render some of quite the  greatest, wisest, and most moral of English writers now almost useless  for our youth. And yet you will find that whenever Englishmen are wholly  without this instinct, their genius is comparatively weak and  restricted.      15. Now, the first necessity for the doing of any great work in ideal  art, is the looking upon all foulness with horror, as a contemptible  though dreadful enemy. You may easily understand what I mean, by  comparing the feelings with which Dante regards any form of obscenity or  of base jest, with the temper in which the same things are regarded by  Shakespeare. And this strange earthly instinct of ours, coupled as it  is, in our good men, with great simplicity and common sense, renders  them shrewd and perfect observers and delineators of actual nature, low  or high; but precludes them from that specialty of art which is properly  called sublime. If ever we try anything in the manner of Michael Angelo  or of Dante, we catch a fall, even in literature, as Milton in the  battle of the angels, spoiled from Hesiod; while in art, every attempt  in this style has hitherto been the sign either of the presumptuous  egotism of persons who had never really learned to be workmen, or it has  been connected with very tragic forms of the contemplation of death,--it  has always been partly insane, and never once wholly successful.    But we need not feel any discomfort in these limitations of our  capacity. We can do much that others cannot, and more than we have ever  yet ourselves completely done. Our first great gift is in the  portraiture of living people--a power already so accomplished in both  Reynolds and Gainsborough that nothing is left for future masters but to  add the calm of perfect workmanship to their vigour and felicity of  perception. And of what value a true school of portraiture may become in  the future, when worthy men will desire only to be known, and others  will not fear to know them, for what they truly were, we cannot from  any past records of art influence yet conceive. But in my next address  it will be partly my endeavour to show you how much more useful, because  more humble, the labour of great masters might have been, had they been  content to bear record of the souls that were dwelling with them on  earth, instead of striving to give a deceptive glory to those they  dreamed of in heaven.      16. Secondly, we have an intense power of invention and expression in  domestic drama; (King Lear and Hamlet being essentially domestic in  their strongest motives of interest). There is a tendency at this moment  towards a noble development of our art in this direction, checked by  many adverse conditions, which may be summed in one,--the insufficiency  of generous civic or patriotic passion in the heart of the English  people; a fault which makes its domestic affection selfish, contracted,  and, therefore, frivolous.      17. Thirdly, in connection with our simplicity and good-humour, and  partly with that very love of the grotesque which debases our ideal, we  have a sympathy with the lower animals which is peculiarly our own; and  which, though it has already found some exquisite expression in the  works of Bewick and Landseer, is yet quite undeveloped. This sympathy,  with the aid of our now authoritative science of physiology, and in  association with our British love of adventure, will, I hope, enable us  to give to the future inhabitants of the globe an almost perfect record  of the present forms of animal life upon it, of which many are on the  point of being extinguished.    Lastly, but not as the least important of our special powers, I have to  note our skill in landscape, of which I will presently speak more  particularly.      18. Such I conceive to be the directions in which, principally, we have  the power to excel; and you must at once see how the consideration of  them must modify the advisable methods of our art study. For if our  professional painters were likely to produce pieces of art loftily ideal  in their character, it would be desirable to form the taste of the  students here by setting before them only the purest examples of Greek,  and the mightiest of Italian, art. But I do not think you will yet find  a single instance of a school directed exclusively to these"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19166"],[0,"The Quirt (#3)"],[1," mentioned cabbage, onions and fried fish as  undesirable foodstuffs. Outside, the palm leaves were dripping in the  night fog that had swept soggily in from the ocean. Her mother was  trying to collect a gas bill from the dressmaker down the hall, who  protested shrilly that she distinctly remembered having paid that gas  bill once and had no intention of paying it twice.    Lorraine opened the door marked LANDLADY, and closed it with a slam  intended to remind her mother that bickerings in the hall were less  desirable than the odor of fried onions. She had often spoken to her  mother about the vulgarity of arguing in public with the tenants, but  her mother never seemed to see things as Lorraine saw them.    In the apartment sat a man who had been too frequent a visitor, as  Lorraine judged him. He was an oldish man with the lines of failure in  his face and on his lean form the sprightly clothing of youth. He had  been a reporter,--was still, he maintained. But Lorraine suspected  shrewdly that he scarcely made a living for himself, and that he was  home-hunting in more ways than one when he came to visit her mother.    The affair had progressed appreciably in her absence, it would appear.  He greeted her with, a fatherly \"Hello, kiddie,\" and would have kissed  her had Lorraine not evaded him skilfully.    Her mother came in then and complained intimately to the man, and  declared that the dressmaker would have to pay that bill or have her gas  turned off. He offered sympathy, assistance in the turning off of the  gas, and a kiss which was perfectly audible to Lorraine in the next  room. The affair had indeed progressed!    \"L'raine, d'you know you've got a new papa?\" her mother called out in  the peculiar, chirpy tone she used when she was exuberantly happy. \"I  knew you'd be surprised!\"    \"I am,\" Lorraine agreed, pulling aside the cheap green portieres and  looked in upon the two. Her tone was unenthusiastic. \"A superfluous gift  of doubtful value. I do not feel the need of a papa, thank you. If you  want him for a husband, mother, that is entirely your own affair. I hope  you'll be very happy.\"    \"The kid don't want a papa; husbands are what means the most in her  young life,\" chuckled the groom, restraining his bride when she would  have risen from his knee.    \"I hope you'll both be very happy indeed,\" said Lorraine gravely. \"Now  you won't mind, mother, when I tell you that I am going to dad's ranch  in Idaho. I really meant it for a vacation, but since you won't be  alone, I may stay with dad permanently. I'm leaving to-morrow or the  next day--just as soon as I can pack my trunk and get a Pullman berth.\"    She did not wait to see the relief in her mother's face contradicting  the expostulations on her lips. She went out to the telephone in the  hall, remembered suddenly that her business would be overheard by half  the tenants, and decided to use the public telephone in a hotel farther  down the street. Her decision to go to her dad had been born with the  words on her lips. But it was a lusty, full-voiced young decision, and  it was growing at an amazing rate.    Of course she would go to her dad in Idaho! She was astonished that the  idea had never before crystallized into action. Why should she feed her  imagination upon a mimic West, when the great, glorious real West was  there? What if her dad had not written a word for more than a year? He  must be alive; they would surely have heard of his death, for she and  Royal were his sole heirs, and his partner would have their address.    She walked fast and arrived at the telephone booth so breathless that  she was compelled to wait a few minutes before she could call her  number. She inquired about trains and rates to Echo, Idaho.    Echo, Idaho! While she waited for the information clerk to look it up  the very words conjured visions of wide horizons and clean winds and  high adventure. If she pictured Echo, Idaho, as being a replica of the  \"set\" used in the movie serial, can you wonder? If she saw herself, the  beloved queen of her father's cowboys, dashing into Echo, Idaho, on a  crimply-maned broncho that pirouetted gaily before the post-office while  handsome young men in chaps and spurs and \"big four\" Stetsons watched  her yearningly, she was merely living mentally the only West that she  knew.    From that beatific vision Lorraine floated into others more entrancing.  All the hairbreadth escapes of the heroine of the movie serial were  hers, adapted by her native logic to fit within the bounds of  possibility,--though I must admit they bulged here and there and  threatened to overlap and to encroach upon the impossible. Over the  hills where her father's vast herds grazed, sleek and wild and  long-horned and prone to stampede, galloped the Lorraine of Lorraine's  dreams, on horses sure-footed and swift. With her galloped strong men  whose faces limned the features of her favorite Western \"lead.\"    That for all her three years of intermittent intimacy with a  disillusioning world of mimicry, her dreams were pure romance, proved  that Lorraine had still the unclouded innocence of her girlhood  unspoiled.          CHAPTER THREE    REALITY IS WEIGHED AND FOUND WANTING      Still dreaming her dreams, still featuring herself as the star of many  adventures, Lorraine followed the brakeman out of the dusty day coach  and down the car steps to the platform of the place called Echo, Idaho.  I can only guess at what she expected to find there in the person of a  cattle-king father, but whatever it was she did not find it. No father,  of any type whatever, came forward to claim her. In spite of her  \"Western\" experience she looked about her for a taxi, or at least a  street car. Even in the wilds of Western melodrama one could hear the  clang of street-car gongs warning careless autoists off the track.    After the train had hooted and gone on around an absolutely  uninteresting low hill of yellow barrenness dotted with stunted sage, it  was the silence that first impressed Lorraine disagreeably. Echo, Idaho,  was a very poor imitation of all the Western sets she had ever seen.  True, it had the straggling row of square-fronted, one-story buildings,  with hitch rails, but the signs painted across the fronts were  absolutely common. Any director she had ever obeyed would have sent for  his assistant director and would have used language which a lady must  not listen to. Behind the store and the post-office and the blacksmith  shop, on the brow of the low hill around whose point the train had  disappeared, were houses with bay windows and porches absolutely out of  keeping with the West. So far as Lorraine could see, there was not a log  cabin in the whole place.    The hitch rails were empty, and there was not a cowboy in sight. Before  the post-office a terribly grimy touring car stood with its  running-boards loaded with canvas-covered suitcases. Three goggled,  sunburned women in ugly khaki suits were disconsolately drinking soda  water from bottles without straws, and a goggled, red-faced,  angry-looking man was jerking impatiently at the hood of the machine.  Lorraine and her suitcase apparently excited no interest whatever in  Echo, Idaho.    The station agent was carrying two boxes of oranges and a crate of  California cabbages in out of the sun, and a limp individual in blue  gingham shirt and dirty overalls had shouldered the mail sack and was  making his way across the dusty, rut-scored street to the post-office.    Two questions and two brief answers convinced her that the station agent  did not know Britton Hunter,--which was strange, unless this happened to  be a very new agent. Lorraine left him to his cabbages and followed the  man with the mail sack.    At the post-office the anemic clerk came forward, eyeing her with  admiring curiosity. Lorraine had seen anemic young men all her life, and  the last three years had made her perfectly familiar with that look in a  young man's eyes. She met it with impatient disfavor founded chiefly  upon the young man's need of a decent hair-cut, a less flowery tie and a  tailored suit. When he confessed that he did not know Mr. Britton Hunter  by sight he ceased to exist so far as Lorraine was concerned. She  decided that he also was new to the place and therefore perfectly  useless to her.    The postmaster himself--Lorraine was cheered by his spectacles, his  shirt sleeves, and his chin whiskers, which made him look the part--was  better informed. He, too, eyed her curiously when she said \"My father,  Mr. Britton Hunter,\" but he made no comment on the relationship. He gave  her a telegram and a letter from the General Delivery. The telegram, she  suspected, was the one she had sent to her dad announcing the date of  her arrival. The postmaster advised her to get a \"livery rig\" and drive  out to the ranch, since it might be a week or two before any one came in  from the Quirt. Lorraine thanked him graciously and departed for the  livery stable.    The man in charge there chewed tobacco meditatively and told her that  his teams were all out. If she was a mind to wait over a day or two, he  said, he might maybe be able to make the trip. Lorraine took a long look  at the structure which he indicated as the hotel.    \"I think I'll walk,\" she said calmly.    \"_Walk_?\" The stableman stopped chewing and stared at her. \"It's some  consider'ble of a walk. It's all of eighteen mile--I dunno but twenty,  time y'get to the house.\"    \"I have frequently walked twenty-five or thirty miles. I am a member of  the Sierra Club in Los Angeles. We seldom take hikes of less than  twenty miles. If you will kindly tell me which road I must take----\"    \"There she is,\" the man stated flatly, and pointed across the railroad  track to where a sandy road drew a yellowish line through the sage,  evidently making for the hills showing hazily violet in the distance.  Those hills formed the only break in the monotonous gray"]]]
