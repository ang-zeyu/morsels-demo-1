Is recourse necessary to a theory of supernatural agency, or  is there another and adequate solution? Was Henry's individual will of  such miraculous force that he could ride roughshod in insolent pride  over public opinion at home and abroad? Or did his personal ends,  dictated perhaps by selfish motives and ignoble passions, so far  coincide with the interests and prejudices of the politically  effective portion of his people, that they were willing to condone a  violence and tyranny, the brunt of which fell after all on the few?  Such is the riddle which propounds itself to every student of Tudor  history. It cannot be answered by paeans in honour of Henry's intensity  of will and force of character, nor by invectives against his vices  and lamentations over the woes of his victims. The miraculous  interpretation of history is as obsolete as the catastrophic theory of  geology, and the explanation of Henry's career must be sought not so  much in the study of his character as in the study of his environment,  of the conditions which made things possible to him that were not  possible before or since and are not likely to be so again.           *       *       *       *       *    It is a singular circumstance that the king who raised the personal  power of English monarchy to a height to which it had never before  attained, should have come of humble race and belonged to an upstart  dynasty. For three centuries and a half before the battle of Bosworth  one family had occupied the English throne. Even the usurpers, Henry  of Bolingbroke and Richard of York, were directly descended in unbroken  male line from Henry II., and from 1154 to 1485 all the sovereigns of  England were Plantagenets. But who were the Tudors? They were a    (p. 005)  Welsh family of modest means and doubtful antecedents.[22] They  claimed, it is true, descent from Cadwallader, and their pedigree was  as long and quite as veracious as most Welsh genealogies; but Henry  VII.'s great-grandfather was steward or butler to the Bishop of  Bangor. His son, Owen Tudor, came as a young man to seek his fortune  at the Court of Henry V., and obtained a clerkship of the wardrobe to  Henry's Queen, Catherine of France. So skilfully did he use or abuse  this position of trust, that he won the heart of his mistress; and  within a few years of Henry's death his widowed Queen and her clerk of  the wardrobe were secretly, and possibly without legal sanction,  living together as man and wife. The discovery of their relations  resulted in Catherine's retirement to Bermondsey Abbey, and Owen's to  Newgate prison. The Queen died in the following year, but Owen  survived many romantic adventures. Twice he escaped from prison, twice  he was recaptured. Once he took sanctuary in the precincts of  Westminster Abbey, and various attempts to entrap him were made by  enticing him to revels in a neighbouring tavern. Finally, on the  outbreak of the Wars of the Roses, he espoused the Lancastrian cause,  and was beheaded by order of Edward IV. after the battle of Mortimer's  Cross. Two sons, Edmund and Jasper, were born of this singular match  between Queen and clerk of her wardrobe. Both enjoyed the favour of  their royal half-brother, Henry VI. Edmund, the elder, was first  knighted and then created Earl of Richmond. In the Parliament of 1453,  he was formally declared legitimate; he was enriched by the grant of  broad estates and enrolled among the members of Henry's council.   (p. 006)  But the climax of his fortunes was reached when, in 1455, he married  the Lady Margaret Beaufort. Owen Tudor had taken the first step which  led to his family's greatness; Edmund took the second. The blood-royal  of France flowed in his veins, the blood-royal of England was to flow  in his children's; and the union between Edmund Tudor and Margaret  Beaufort gave Henry VII. such claim as he had by descent to the  English throne.                       [Footnote 22: _Archaeologia Cambrensis_, 1st ser.,                     iv., 267; 3rd ser., xv., 278, 379.]    The Beauforts were descended from Edward III., but a bar sinister  marred their royal pedigree. John of Gaunt had three sons by Catherine  Swynford before she became his wife. That marriage would, by canon  law, have made legitimate the children, but the barons had, on a  famous occasion, refused to assimilate in this respect the laws of  England to the canons of the Church; and it required a special Act of  Parliament to confer on the Beauforts the status of legitimacy. When  Henry IV. confirmed this Act, he introduced a clause specifically  barring their contingent claim to the English throne. This limitation  could not legally abate the force of a statute; but it sufficed to  cast a doubt upon the Beaufort title, and has been considered a  sufficient explanation of Henry VII.'s reluctance to base his claim  upon hereditary right. However that may be, the Beauforts played no  little part in the English history of the fifteenth century; their  influence was potent for peace or war in the councils of their royal  half-brother, Henry IV., and of the later sovereigns of the House of  Lancaster. One was Cardinal-Bishop of Winchester, another was Duke of  Exeter, and a third was Earl of Somerset. Two of the sons of the Earl  became Dukes of Somerset; the younger fell at St. Albans, the      (p. 007)  earliest victim of the Wars of the Roses, which proved so fatal to  his House; and the male line of the Beauforts failed in the third  generation. The sole heir to their claims was the daughter of the  first Duke of Somerset, Margaret, now widow of Edmund Tudor; for,  after a year of wedded life, Edmund had died in November, 1456. Two  months later his widow gave birth to a boy, the future Henry VII.;  and, incredible as the fact may seem, the youthful mother was not  quite fourteen years old. When fifteen more years had passed, the  murder of Henry VI. and his son left Margaret Beaufort and Henry Tudor  in undisputed possession of the Lancastrian title. A barren honour it  seemed. Edward IV. was firmly seated on the English throne. His right  to it, by every test, was immeasurably superior to the Tudor claim,  and Henry showed no inclination and possessed not the means to dispute  it. The usurpation by Richard III., and the crimes which polluted his  reign, put a different aspect on the situation, and set men seeking  for an alternative to the blood-stained tyrant. The battle of Bosworth  followed, and the last of the Plantagenets gave way to the first of  the Tudors.    For the first time, since the Norman Conquest, a king of decisively  British blood sat on the English throne. His lineage was, indeed,  English in only a minor degree; but England might seem to have lost at  the battle of Hastings her right to native kings; and Norman were  succeeded by Angevin, Angevin by Welsh, Welsh by Scots, and Scots by  Hanoverian sovereigns. The Tudors were probably more at home on the  English throne than most of England's kings; and their humble and  British origin may have contributed to their unique capacity for   (p. 008)  understanding the needs, and expressing the mind, of the English  nation. It was well for them that they established their throne in the  hearts of their people, for no dynasty grasped the sceptre with less  of hereditary right. Judged by that criterion, there were many  claimants whose titles must have been preferred to Henry's. There were  the daughters of Edward IV. and the children of George, Duke of  Clarence; and their existence may account for Henry's neglect to press  his hereditary claim. But there was a still better reason. Supposing  the Lancastrian case to be valid and the Beauforts to be the true  Lancastrian heirs, even so the rightful occupant of the throne was not  Henry VII., but his mother, Margaret Beaufort. England had never  recognised a Salic law at home; on occasion she had disputed its  validity abroad. But Henry VII. was not disposed to let his mother  rule; she could not unite the Yorkist and Lancastrian claims by  marriage, and, in addition to other disabilities, she had a second  husband in Lord Stanley, who might demand the crown matrimonial. So  Henry VII.'s hereditary title was judiciously veiled in vague  obscurity. Parliament wisely admitted the accomplished fact and  recognised that the crown was vested in him, without rashly venturing  upon the why or the wherefore. He had in truth been raised to the  throne because men were weary of Richard. He was chosen to vindicate  no theory of hereditary or other abstract right, but to govern with a  firm hand, to establish peace within his gates and give prosperity to  his people. That was the true Tudor title, and, as a rule, they  remembered the fact; they were _de facto_ kings, and they left the _de  jure_ arguments to the Stuarts.    Peace, however, could not be obtained at once, nor the embers of   (p. 009)  thirty years' strife stamped out in a moment. For fifteen years  open revolt and whispered sedition troubled the rest of the realm and  threatened the stability of Henry's throne. Ireland remained a hot-bed  of Yorkist sympathies, and Ireland was zealously aided by Edward IV.'s  sister, Margaret of Burgundy; she pursued, like a vendetta, the family  quarrel with Henry VII., and earned the title of Henry's Juno by  harassing him as vindictively as the Queen of Heaven vexed the pious  AEneas. Other rulers, with no Yorkist bias, were slow to recognise the  _parvenu_ king and quick to profit by his difficulties. Pretenders to  their rivals' thrones were useful pawns on the royal chess-board; and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20317"],[0,"A Treatise on Staff Making and Pivoting (#3)"],[1,"anner.          CHAPTER III.      Our wire has been roughed out into the form of a staff, has been hardened  and the temper drawn down to the requisite hardness and we are now ready  to proceed with our work. As I said before, we have now arrived at a  point where many authorities differ, _i. e._, as to whether the finishing  of the staff proper, should be performed while the work is held in the  chuck, or whether a wax chuck be substituted. We will take it for granted  that you have a true chuck and that you prefer to finish all the lower  portion of the staff while held in the chuck.    Before we proceed with our work it will be necessary for us to make some  accurate measurements, as we cannot afford to do any guess work by  measuring by means of the old staff. I have used a number of different  kinds of calipers and measuring instruments for determining the various  measurements for a balance staff, but have met with more success with a  very simple little tool which I made myself from drawings and description  published some years ago in THE AMERICAN JEWELER. This simple little tool  is shown in Fig. 7, and has been of great service to me. It consists of a  brass sleeve A, with a projection at one end as shown at B. This sleeve  is threaded, and into it is fitted the screw part C, which terminates in  a pivot D, which is small enough to enter the smallest jewel. The sleeve  I made from a solid piece of brass, turning it down in my lathe and  finishing the projection by means of a file. The hole was then drilled  and threaded with a standard thread. The screw part C, I made of steel  and polished carefully.    [Illustration: _Fig. 7._]    To ascertain the proper height for the roller, place it upon the tool,  allowing it to rest upon the leg B, and set the pivot D in the foot  jewel. Now adjust, by means of the screw C until the roller is in its  proper position in relation to the lever fork. This may be understood  better by consulting Fig. 8, where A is the gauge, C is the roller, E is  the lever, F is the plate and G is the potance.    [Illustration: _Fig. 8._]    Now in order to locate the proper place to cut the seat for the roller,  remove it from the foot of the gauge and apply the gauge to the work as  shown in Fig. 9. The foot of the gauge resting against the end of the  pivot, the taper end of the gauge will locate accurately the position of  the roller seat. In order to locate the proper position for the seat for  the balance, proceed the same as for the roller, except that the foot of  the gauge is lowered until it is brought sufficiently below the plate to  allow of the proper clearance as indicated by the dotted lines at H. Now  apply the gauge to the new staff, as shown in Fig. 10, and the taper end  will locate the exact position for the balance seat.    [Illustration: _Fig. 9._]    [Illustration: _Fig. 10._]    As previously stated, I have taken it for granted that you preferred to  finish all the lower portion of the staff while the work was held in the  chuck. I have assumed that you prefer to work in this way because I have  noted the fact that nine watchmakers out of every ten start with, and  first finish up, the lower portion of the staff. Where this method of  working originated I do not know, but it always has the appearance to me  of \"placing the cart before the horse.\" I do not pretend to say that a  true staff cannot be made in this way, but it certainly is not the most  convenient nor advisable. We all know that the heaviest part of the staff  is from the roller seat to the end of the top pivot. Now it seems to me  that it is the most natural thing in the world for a mechanic to desire  to turn the greater bulk of his work before reversing it. Now if the  workman has been educated to turn indifferently with right or left hand,  it may make little difference, as far as the actual turning is concerned,  whether he starts to work at the upper or lower end of the staff, but  unfortunately there are few among us who are so skilled as to use the  graver with equal facility with either hand, and it is therefore an  advantage to start with the upper end, as you can thus finish a greater  portion of the work more readily. You can readily see that when you come  to reverse your staff and use the wax chuck, that by starting at the top  of staff your wax has a much larger surface of metal to cling to, and  again the shape of the balance seat is such as to secure the work firmly  in the wax, while if the reverse method is employed, the larger portion  of the balance seat is exposed and the staff is more liable to loosen  from the motion of the lathe and pressure of the graver and polishers.          CHAPTER IV.      By the aid of the pinion calipers and the old staff, the diameter of the  roller seat and the balance and hair-spring collet seats may be readily  taken, but it is perhaps better to gauge the holes, as the old staff may  not have been perfect in this respect. A round broach will answer  admirably for this purpose, and the size may be taken from the broach by  means of the calipers. In fitting our pivots, we can not be too exact;  and as yet no instrument has been placed upon the market for this purpose  which is moderate in price and yet thoroughly reliable. The majority of  watchmakers use what is termed the pivot-gauge, a neat little instrument  which accompanies the Jacot lathe, and which may be obtained from any  material house. This tool, which is shown in Fig. 11, is, however, open  to one objection in the measurement of pivots, and that is that it may be  pressed down at one time with greater force than at another, and  consequently will show a variation in two measurements of the same pivot.  Some of my readers may think that I am over-particular on this point, and  that the difference in measurement on two occasions is too trivial to be  worthy of attention, but I do not think that too much care can be  bestowed upon this part of the work, and neglect in this particular is,  I think, the cause of poor performance in many otherwise good  timepieces. The ordinarily accepted rule among watchmakers is that a  pivot should be made 1/2500 of an inch smaller than the hole in the jewel  to allow for the proper lubrication. I am acquainted with watchmakers,  and men who are termed good workmen, too, who invariably allow 1/2500 of  an inch side shake, no matter whether the pivot is 12/2500 or 16/2500 of  an inch in diameter. Now if 1/2500 of an inch is the proper side shake  for a pivot measuring 12/2500 of an inch in diameter, it is certainly not  sufficient for a pivot which is one-third larger. Of course it is  understood that side shakes do not increase in proportion according as  the pivot increases in size, for if they did a six-inch shaft would  require at this rate a side shake of 1/2 inch, or 1/4 inch on each side,  which would be ridiculously out of all proportion, as the 1/64 of an inch  would be ample under any circumstances. Neither can we arrive at the  proper end shake for a pivot by reducing in proportion from the end shake  allowed on a six-inch shaft, because if we followed out the same course  of reasoning we would arrive at a point where a pivot measuring 12/2500  of an inch would require an end shake so infinitely small that it would  require six figures to express the denominator of the fraction, and the  most minute measuring instrument yet invented would be incapable of  recording the measurement. We must leave sufficient side shake, however,  on the smallest pivot and jewel for the globules of the oil to move  freely, and experiments have shown conclusively that 1/2500 of an inch or  1/5000 on each side of the pivot, is as little space as it is desirable  to leave for that purpose, as the globules of the best chronometer oil  will refuse to enter spaces that are very much more minute. But to return  to our pivot gauge.    [Illustration: _Fig. 11._]    [Illustration: _Fig. 12._]    Each division on the gauge represents 1/2500 of an inch, which is all  that we require. The diameter that the pivot should be, can be  ascertained by inserting a round pivot broach into the jewel and taking  the measurement with the pivot gauge, and then making the necessary  deduction for side shake. Slip the jewel on the broach as far as it will  go, as shown in Fig. 12, and then with the pivot gauge, take the size of  the broach, as close up to the jewel as you can measure, and the taper of  the broach will be about right for the side shake of the pivot. If,  however, you prefer to make the measurement still more accurate, you can  do so by dipping the broach into rouge before slipping on the jewel and  then remove the jewel and the place which is occupied on the broach can  be plainly discerned and the exact measurement taken and an allowance of  1/2500 of an inch made for the side shake. Another method, and one which  is particularly applicable to Swiss watches, where the jewel is burnished  into the cock or plate, is to first slip on to the broach a small flat  piece of cork and as the broach enters the jewel the cork is forced  farther on to the broach, and when the jewel is removed it marks the  place on the broach which its inner side occupied, and the measurement  can then be taken with the gauge. If care is used in the selection of a  broach, that it be as nearly perfect in round and taper as possible, by a  little experiment you can soon ascertain just what part of the length of  the broach corresponds to one degree on the gauge and by a repetition of  the experiment the broach can then be divided accurately, by very minute  rings turned with a fine-pointed graver, into sections, each representing  one degree, or 1/2500 of an inch, and the measurement will thus be  simplified greatly.    [Illustration: _Fig. 13._]    As before stated, much depends upon the condition of your gravers and the  manner of using them. It is of the utmost importance that they be kept"]]]
