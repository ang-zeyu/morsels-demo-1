Judicial  astrology was one of those systems in which Carathis was a perfect adept;  she began, therefore, with reminding her son of the promise which the  stars had made him, and intimated an intention of consulting them again.    \"Alas!\" sighed the Caliph, as soon as he could speak, \"what a fool have I  been! not for the kicks bestowed on my guards who so tamely submitted to  death, but for never considering that this extraordinary man was the same  the planets had foretold, whom, instead of ill-treating, I should have  conciliated by all the arts of persuasion.\"    \"The past,\" said Carathis, \"cannot be recalled, but it behoves us to  think of the future; perhaps you may again see the object you so much  regret; it is possible the inscriptions on the sabres will afford  information.  Eat, therefore, and take thy repose, my dear son; we will  consider to-morrow in what manner to act.\"    Vathek yielded to her counsel as well as he could, and arose in the  morning with a mind more at ease.  The sabres he commanded to be  instantly brought, and poring upon them through a green glass, that their  glittering might not dazzle, he set himself in earnest to decipher the  inscriptions; but his reiterated attempts were all of them nugatory; in  vain did he beat his head and bite his nails, not a letter of the whole  was he able to ascertain.  So unlucky a disappointment would have undone  him again had not Carathis by good fortune entered the apartment.    \"Have patience, son!\" said she; \"you certainly are possessed of every  important science, but the knowledge of languages is a trifle at best,  and the accomplishment of none but a pedant.  Issue forth a proclamation  that you will confer such rewards as become your greatness upon any one  that shall interpret what you do not understand, and what it is beneath  you to learn; you will soon find your curiosity gratified.\"    \"That may be,\" said the Caliph; \"but in the meantime I shall be horribly  disgusted by a crowd of smatterers, who will come to the trial as much  for the pleasure of retailing their jargon as from the hope of gaining  the reward.  To avoid this evil it will be proper to add that I will put  every candidate to death who shall fail to give satisfaction; for, thank  Heaven! I have skill enough to distinguish between one that translates  and one that invents.\"    \"Of that I have no doubt,\" replied Carathis; \"but to put the ignorant to  death is somewhat severe, and may be productive of dangerous effects;  content yourself with commanding their beards to be burnt--beards in a  state are not quite so essential as men.\"    The Caliph submitted to the reasons of his mother, and sending for  Morakanabad, his prime vizir, said: \"Let the common criers proclaim, not  only in Samarah, but throughout every city in my empire, that whosoever  will repair hither, and decipher certain characters which appear to be  inexplicable, shall experience the liberality for which I am renowned;  but that all who fail upon trial shall have their beards burnt off to the  last hair.  Let them add also that I will bestow fifty beautiful slaves,  and as many jars of apricots from the Isle of Kirmith, upon any man that  shall bring me intelligence of the stranger.\"    The subjects of the Caliph, like their Sovereign, being great admirers of  women and apricots from Kirmith, felt their mouths water at these  promises, but were totally unable to gratify their hankering, for no one  knew which way the stranger had gone.    As to the Caliph's other requisition, the result was different.  The  learned, the half-learned, and those who were neither, but fancied  themselves equal to both, came boldly to hazard their beards, and all  shamefully lost them.    The exaction of these forfeitures, which found sufficient employment for  the eunuchs, gave them such a smell of singed hair as greatly to disgust  the ladies of the seraglio, and make it necessary that this new  occupation of their guardians should be transferred into other hands.    At length, however, an old man presented himself whose beard was a cubit  and a half longer than any that had appeared before him.  The officers of  the palace whispered to each other, as they ushered him in, \"What a pity  such a beard should be burnt!\"  Even the Caliph, when he saw it,  concurred with them in opinion, but his concern was entirely needless.  This venerable personage read the characters with facility, and explained  them verbatim as follows: \"We were made where everything good is made; we  are the least of the wonders of a place where all is wonderful, and  deserving the sight of the first potentate on earth.\"    \"You translate admirably!\" cried Vathek; \"I know to what these marvellous  characters allude.  Let him receive as many robes of honour and thousands  of sequins of gold as he hath spoken words.  I am in some measure  relieved from the perplexity that embarrassed me!\"    Vathek invited the old main to dine, and even to remain some days in the  palace.  Unluckily for him, he accepted the offer; for the Caliph, having  ordered him next morning to be called, said: \"Read again to me what you  have read already; I cannot hear too often the promise that is made me,  the completion of which I languish to obtain.\"    The old man forthwith put on his green spectacles, but they instantly  dropped from his nose on perceiving that the characters he had read the  day preceding had given place to others of different import.    \"What ails you?\" asked the Caliph; \"and why these symptoms of wonder?\"    \"Sovereign of the world,\" replied the old man, \"these sabres hold another  language to-day from that they yesterday held.\"    \"How say you?\" returned Vathek; \"but it matters not! tell me, if you can,  what they mean.\"    \"It is this, my lord,\" rejoined the old man: \"Woe to the rash mortal who  seeks to know that of which he should remain ignorant, and to undertake  that which surpasseth his power!\"    \"And woe to thee!\" cried the Caliph, in a burst of indignation; \"to-day  thou art void of understanding.  Begone from my presence; they shall burn  but the half of thy beard, because, thou wert yesterday fortunate in  guessing; my gifts I never resume.\"    The old man, wise enough to perceive he had luckily escaped, considering  the folly of disclosing so disgusting a truth, immediately withdrew, and  appeared not again.    But it was not long before Vathek discovered abundant reason to regret  his precipitation; for though he could not decipher the characters  himself, yet by constantly poring upon them he plainly perceived that  they every day changed, and unfortunately no other candidate offered to  explain them.  This perplexing occupation inflamed his blood, dazzled his  sight, and brought on a giddiness and debility that he could not support.  He failed not, however, though in so reduced a condition, to be often  carried to his tower, as he flattered himself that he might there read in  the stars which he went to consult something more congenial to his  wishes: but in this his hopes were deluded, for his eyes, dimmed by the  vapours of his head, began to subserve his curiosity so ill, that he  beheld nothing but a thick dun cloud, which he took for the most direful  of omens.    Agitated with so much anxiety, Vathek entirely lost all firmness; a fever  seized him, and his appetite failed.  Instead of being one of the  greatest eaters, he became as distinguished for drinking.  So insatiable  was the thirst which tormented him that his mouth, like a funnel, was  always open to receive the various liquors that might be poured into it,  and especially cold water, which calmed him more than every other.    This unhappy prince being thus incapacitated for the enjoyment of any  pleasure, commanded the palaces of the five senses to be shut up, forbore  to appear in public, either to display his magnificence or administer  justice, and retired to the inmost apartment of his harem.  As he had  ever been an indulgent husband, his wives, overwhelmed with grief at his  deplorable situation, incessantly offered their prayers for his health,  and unremittingly supplied him with water.    In the meantime the Princess Carathis, whose affliction no words can  describe, instead of restraining herself to sobbing and tears, was  closeted daily with the Vizir Morakanabad, to find out some cure or  mitigation of the Caliph's disease.  Under the persuasion that it was  caused by enchantment, they turned over together, leaf by leaf, all the  books of magic that might point out a remedy, and caused the horrible  stranger, whom they accused as the enchanter, to be everywhere sought for  with the strictest diligence.    At the distance of a few miles from Samarah stood a high mountain, whose  sides were swarded with wild thyme and basil, and its summit overspread  with so delightful a plain, that it might be taken for the paradise  destined for the faithful.  Upon it grew a hundred thickets of eglantine  and other fragrant shrubs, a hundred arbours of roses, jessamine, and  honeysuckle, as many clumps of orange trees, cedar, and citron, whose  branches, interwoven with the palm, the pomegranate, and the vine,  presented every luxury that could regale the eye or the taste.  The  ground was strewed with violets, hare-bells, and pansies, in the midst of  which sprang forth tufts of jonquils, hyacinths, and carnations, with  every other perfume that impregnates the air.  Four fountains, not less  clear than deep, and so abundant as to slake the thirst of ten armies,  seemed profusely placed here to make the scene more resemble the garden  of Eden, which was watered by the four sacred rivers.  Here the  nightingale sang the birth of the rose, "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20606"],[0,"The Magic City (#3)"],[1,"day he looked at all the things again and longed to make  something with them. He was accustomed to the joy that comes of making  things. He and Helen had built many a city for the dream island out of  his own two boxes of bricks and certain other things in the house--her  Japanese cabinet, the dominoes and chessmen, cardboard boxes, books, the  lids of kettles and teapots. But they had never had enough bricks. Lucy  had enough bricks for anything.    He began to build a city on the nursery table. But to build with bricks  alone is poor work when you have been used to building with all sorts of  other things.    'It looks like a factory,' said Philip discontentedly. He swept the  building down and replaced the bricks in their different boxes.    'There must be something downstairs that would come in useful,' he told  himself, 'and she did say, \"Take what you like.\"'    By armfuls, two and three at a time, he carried down the boxes of bricks  and the boxes of blocks, the draughts, the chessmen, and the box of  dominoes. He took them into the long drawing-room where the crystal  chandeliers were, and the chairs covered in brown holland--and the many  long, light windows, and the cabinets and tables covered with the most  interesting things.    He cleared a big writing-table of such useless and unimportant objects  as blotting-pad, silver inkstand, and red-backed books, and there was a  clear space for his city.    He began to build.    A bronze Egyptian god on a black and gold cabinet seemed to be looking  at him from across the room.    'All right,' said Philip. 'I'll build you a temple. You wait a bit.'    The bronze god waited and the temple grew, and two silver candlesticks,  topped by chessmen, served admirably as pillars for the portico. He made  a journey to the nursery to fetch the Noah's Ark animals--the pair of  elephants, each standing on a brick, flanked the entrance. It looked  splendid, like an Assyrian temple in the pictures Helen had shown him.  But the bricks, wherever he built with them alone, looked mean, and like  factories or workhouses. Bricks alone always do.    Philip explored again. He found the library. He made several journeys.  He brought up twenty-seven volumes bound in white vellum with marbled  boards, a set of Shakespeare, ten volumes in green morocco. These made  pillars and cloisters, dark, mysterious, and attractive. More Noah's Ark  animals added an Egyptian-looking finish to the building.    'Lor', ain't it pretty!' said the parlour-maid, who came to call him to  tea. 'You are clever with your fingers, Master Philip, I will say that  for you. But you'll catch it, taking all them things.'    'That grey nurse said I might,' said Philip, 'and it doesn't hurt things  building with them. My sister and I always did it at home,' he added,  looking confidingly at the parlour-maid. She had praised his building.  And it was the first time he had mentioned his sister to any one in that  house.    'Well, it's as good as a peep-show,' said the parlour-maid; 'it's just  like them picture post-cards my brother in India sends me. All them  pillars and domes and things--and the animals too. I don't know how you  fare to think of such things, that I don't.'    [Illustration: 'Lor', ain't it pretty!' said the parlour-maid.]    Praise is sweet. He slipped his hand into that of the parlour-maid as  they went down the wide stairs to the hall, where tea awaited him--a  very little tray on a very big, dark table.    'He's not half a bad child,' said Susan at her tea in the servants'  quarters. 'That nurse frightened him out of his little wits with her  prim ways, you may depend. He's civil enough if you speak him civil.'    'But Miss Lucy didn't frighten him, I suppose,' said the cook; 'and look  how he behaved to her.'    'Well, he's quiet enough, anyhow. You don't hear a breath of him from  morning till night,' said the upper housemaid; 'seems silly-like to me.'    'You slip in and look what he's been building, that's all,' Susan told  them. 'You won't call him silly then. India an' pagodas ain't in it.'    They did slip in, all of them, when Philip had gone to bed. The building  had progressed, though it was not finished.    'I shan't touch a thing,' said Susan. 'Let him have it to play with  to-morrow. We'll clear it all away before that nurse comes back with her  caps and her collars and her stuck-up cheek.'    So next day Philip went on with his building. He put everything you can  think of into it: the dominoes, and the domino-box; bricks and books;  cotton-reels that he begged from Susan, and a collar-box and some  cake-tins contributed by the cook. He made steps of the dominoes and a  terrace of the domino-box. He got bits of southernwood out of the garden  and stuck them in cotton-reels, which made beautiful pots, and they  looked like bay trees in tubs. Brass finger-bowls served for domes, and  the lids of brass kettles and coffee-pots from the oak dresser in the  hall made minarets of dazzling splendour. Chessmen were useful for  minarets, too.    'I must have paved paths and a fountain,' said Philip thoughtfully. The  paths were paved with mother-of-pearl card counters, and the fountain  was a silver and glass ash-tray, with a needlecase of filigree silver  rising up from the middle of it; and the falling water was made quite  nicely out of narrow bits of the silver paper off the chocolate Helen  had given him at parting. Palm trees were easily made--Helen had shown  him how to do that--with bits of larch fastened to elder stems with  plasticine. There was plenty of plasticine among Lucy's toys; there was  plenty of everything.    And the city grew, till it covered the table. Philip, unwearied, set  about to make another city on another table. This had for chief feature  a great water-tower, with a fountain round its base; and now he stopped  at nothing. He unhooked the crystal drops from the great chandeliers to  make his fountains. This city was grander than the first. It had a grand  tower made of a waste-paper basket and an astrologer's tower that was a  photograph-enlarging machine.    The cities were really very beautiful. I wish I could describe them  thoroughly to you. But it would take pages and pages. Besides all the  things I have told of alone there were towers and turrets and grand  staircases, pagodas and pavilions, canals made bright and water-like by  strips of silver paper, and a lake with a boat on it. Philip put into  his buildings all the things out of the doll's house that seemed  suitable. The wooden things-to-eat and dishes. The leaden tea-cups and  goblets. He peopled the place with dominoes and pawns. The handsome  chessmen were used for minarets. He made forts and garrisoned them with  lead soldiers.    He worked hard and he worked cleverly, and as the cities grew in beauty  and interestingness he loved them more and more. He was happy now. There  was no time to be unhappy in.    'I will keep it as it is till Helen comes. How she will _love_ it!' he  said.    The two cities were connected by a bridge which was a yard-stick he had  found in the servants' sewing-room and taken without hindrance, for by  this time all the servants were his friends. Susan had been the  first--that was all.    He had just laid his bridge in place, and put Mr. and Mrs. Noah in the  chief square to represent the inhabitants, and was standing rapt in  admiration of his work, when a hard hand on each of his shoulders made  him start and scream.    It was the nurse. She had come back a day sooner than any one expected  her. The brother had brought home a wife, and she and the nurse had not  liked each other; so she was very cross, and she took Philip by the  shoulders and shook him, a thing which had never happened to him before.    'You naughty, wicked boy!' she said, still shaking.    'But I haven't hurt anything--I'll put everything back,' he said,  trembling and very pale.    'You'll not touch any of it again,' said the nurse. 'I'll see to that. I  shall put everything away myself in the morning. Taking what doesn't  belong to you!'    'But you said I might take anything I liked,' said Philip, 'so if it's  wrong it's your fault.'    'You untruthful child!' cried the nurse, and hit him over the knuckles.  Now, no one had ever hit Philip before. He grew paler than ever, but he  did not cry, though his hands hurt rather badly. For she had snatched up  the yard-stick to hit him with, and it was hard and cornery.    'You are a coward,' said Philip, 'and it is you who are untruthful and  not me.'    'Hold your tongue,' said the nurse, and whirled him off to bed.    'You'll get no supper, so there!' she said, angrily tucking him up.    'I don't want any,' said Philip, 'and I have to forgive you before the  sun goes down.'    'Forgive, indeed!' said she, flouncing out.    'When you get sorry you'll know I've forgiven you,' Philip called after  her, which, of course, made her angrier than ever.    Whether Philip cried when he was alone is not our business. Susan, who  had watched the shaking and the hitting without daring to interfere,  crept up later with milk and sponge-cakes. She found him asleep, and she  says his eyelashes were wet.    When he awoke he thought at first that it was morning, the room was so  light. But presently he saw that it was not yellow sunlight but white  moonshine which made the beautiful brightness.    He wondered at first why he felt so unhappy, then he remembered how  Helen had gone away and how hateful the nurse had been. And now she  would pull down the city and Helen would never see it. And he would  never be able to build such a beautiful one again. In the morning it  would be gone, and he would not be able even to remember how it was  built.    The moonlight was very bright.    'I wonder how my city looks by moonlight?' he said.    And then, all in a thrilling instant, he made up his mind to go down and  see for himself how it did look.    He slipped on"]]]
