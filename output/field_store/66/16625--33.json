The  area of the ancient pueblo region may be 150,000 square miles; that of  the plateau country, approximately, 130,000.        [Footnote 10: See Major C. E. Dutton's map of the plateau country      in 6th Ann. Rept. U.S. Geol. Survey, pl. xi. His report on \"Mount      Taylor and the Zuni plateau,\" of which this map is a part,      presents a vivid picture of the plateau country, and his      descriptions are so clear and expressive that any attempt to      better them must result in failure. The statement of the geologic      and topographic features which is incorporated herein is derived      directly from Major Dutton's description, much of it being taken      bodily.]    The plateau country is not a smooth and level region, as its name might  imply; it is extremely rugged, and the topographic obstacles to travel  are greater than in many wild mountain regions. It is a country of  cliffs and canyons, often of considerable magnitude and forming a bar to  extended progress in any direction. The surface is generally smooth or  slightly undulating and apparently level, but it is composed of a series  of platforms or mesas, which are seldom of great extent and generally  terminate at the brink of a wall, often of huge dimensions. There are  mesas everywhere; it is the mesa country.    Although the strata appear to be horizontal, they are slightly tilted.  The inclination, although slight, is remarkably persistent, and the  thickness of the strata remains almost constant. The beds, therefore,  extend from very high altitudes to very low ones, and often the  formation which is exposed to view at the summit of an incline is lost  to view after a few miles, being covered by some later formation, which  in turn is covered by a still later one. Each formation thus appears as  a terrace, bounded on one side by a descending cliff carved out of the  edges of its own strata and on the other by an ascending cliff carved  out of the strata which overlie it. This is the more common form,  although isolated mesas, bits of tableland completely engirdled by  cliffs, are but little less common.    The courses of the margins of the mesas are not regular. The cliffs  sometimes maintain an average trend through great distances, but in  detail their courses are extremely crooked; they wind in and out,  forming alternate alcoves and promontories in the wall, and frequently  they are cut through by valleys, which may be either narrow canyons or  interspaces 10 or even 20 miles wide.    The whole region has been subjected to many displacements, both flexures  of the monoclinal type and faults. Some of these flexures attain a  length of over 80 miles and a displacement of 3,000 feet, and the faults  reach even a greater magnitude. There is also an abundance of volcanic  rocks and extinct volcanoes, and while the principal eruptions have  occurred about the borders of the region, extending but slightly into  it, traces of lesser disturbances can be found throughout the country.  It has been said that if a geologist should actually make the circuit of  the plateau country, he could so conduct his route that for  three-fourths of the time he would be treading upon volcanic materials  and could pitch his camp upon them every night. The oldest eruptions do  not go back of Tertiary time, while some are so recent as probably to  come within the historic period--within three or four centuries.    The strata of the plateau country are remarkable for their homogeneity,  when considered with reference to their horizontal extensions; hardly  less so for their diversity when considered in their vertical relation.  Although the groups differ radically from each other, still each  preserves its characteristics with singularly slight degrees of  variation from place to place. Hence we have a certain amount of  similarity and monotony in the landscape which is aided rather than  diminished by the vegetation; for the vegetation, like the human  occupants of this country, has come under its overpowering influence.  The characteristic landscape consists of a wide expanse of featureless  plains, bounded by far-off cliffs in gorgeous colors; in the foreground  a soil of bright yellow or ashy gray; over all the most brilliant  sunlight, while the distant features are softened by a blue haze.    The most conspicuous formation of the whole region is a massive  bright-red sandstone out of which have been carved \"the most striking  and typical features of those marvelous plateau landscapes which will be  subjects of wonder and delight to all coming generations of men. The  most superb canyons of the neighboring region, the Canyon de Chelly and  the Del Muerto, the lofty pinnacles and towers of the San Juan country,  the finest walls in the great upper chasms of the Colorado, are the  vertical edges of this red sandstone.\"    Of the climate of the plateau country it has been said that in the large  valleys it is \"temperate in winter and insufferable in summer; higher up  the summers are temperate and the winters barely sufferable.\" It is as  though there were two distinct regions covering the same area, for there  are marked differences throughout, except in topographic configuration,  between the lowlands and the uplands or high plateaus. The lowlands  present an appearance which is barren and desolate in the extreme,  although the soil is fertile and under irrigation yields good crops.  Vegetation is limited to a scanty growth of grass during a small part of  the year, with small areas here and there scantily covered by the  prickly greasewood and at intervals by clumps of sagebrush; but even  these prefer a higher level, and develop better on the neighboring mesas  than in the valleys proper. The arborescent growth consists of sparsely  distributed cottonwoods and willows, closely confined to the river  bottoms. On intermediate higher levels junipers and cedars appear, often  standing so closely together as to seriously impede travel, but they are  confined to the tops of mesas and other high ground, the valleys being  generally clear or covered with sagebrush. Still higher up yellow pines  become abundant and in places spread out into magnificent forests, while  in some mountain regions scrub oak, quaking asp, and even spruce trees  are abundant.    In the mountain regions there is often a reasonable amount of moisture,  and some crops, potatoes for example, are grown there without  irrigation; but the season is short. In the Tunicha mountains the Navaho  raise corn at an altitude of nearly 8,000 feet, but they often lose the  crop from drought or from frost. On the intermediate levels and in the  lowlands cultivation by modern methods is practically impossible without  irrigation, except in a few favored localities, where a crop can be  obtained perhaps two years or three years in five. But with a minute  knowledge of the climatic conditions, and with methods adapted to meet  these conditions, scanty crops can be and are raised by the Indians  without irrigation throughout the whole region; but everywhere that  water can be applied the product of the soil is increased many fold.    Near the center of the plateau country, in the northeastern corner of  Arizona, a range of mountains crosses diagonally from northwest to  southeast, extending into New Mexico. In the north an irregular cluster  of considerable size, separated from the remainder of the range, is  called the Carrizo; and the range proper has no less than three names  applied to different parts of it. The northern end is known as the  Lukachukai, the central part as the Tunicha, and the southern part as  the Chuska or Choiskai mountains, all Navaho names. The two former  clusters attain an altitude of 9,500 feet; the Tunicha and the Chuska  are about 9,000 feet high, the latter having a flat top of considerable  area.    On the east these mountains break down rather abruptly into the broad  valley of the Chaco river, or the Chaco wash, as it is more commonly  designated; on the west they break down gradually, through a series of  slopes and mesas, into the Chin Lee valley. Canyon de Chelly has been  cut in the western slope by a series of small streams, which, rising  near the crest of the mountain, combine near its head and flow in a  general westerly direction. The mouth of the canyon is on the eastern  border of the Chin Lee valley. It is 60 miles south of the Utah boundary  and 25 miles west of that of New Mexico; hence it is 60 miles east and a  little north from the old province of Tusayan, the modern Moki, and 85  miles northwest from the old province of Cibola, the modern Zuni. Its  position is almost in the heart of the ancient pueblo region; the Chaco  ruins lie about 80 miles east, and the ruins of the San Juan from 60 to  80 miles north and northeast.      [Illustration: Plate XLII    Map of Canyon De Chelly and Its Branches    Surveyed by Cosmos Mindeleff]    The geographic position of Canyon de Chelly has had an important effect  on its history, forming as it does an available resting place in any  migratory movement either on the north and south line or east and west.  The Tunicha mountains are a serious obstacle to north and south movement  at the present day, but less so than the arid valleys which border them.  Except at one place, and that place is difficult, it is almost  impossible to cross the mountains with a wheeled vehicle, but there are  innumerable trails running in all directions, and these trails are in  constant use by the Navaho, except in the depths of winter. The mountain  route is preferable, however, to the valley roads, where the traveler  for several days is without wood, with very little water and forage, and  his movements are impeded by deep sand.    To the traveler on foot, or even on horseback, Canyon de Chelly is  easily accessible from almost any direction. Good trails run northward  to the San Juan and northeastward over the Tunicha mountains to the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19726"],[0,"The Door Through Space (#3)"],[1,"more adventure had shown me that my  usefulness to the Secret Service was over. Rakhal had vanished, but he  had left me a legacy: my name, written on the sure scrolls of death  anywhere outside the safe boundaries of Terran law. A marked man, I had  gone back to slow stagnation behind a desk. I'd stood it as long as I  could.    When it finally got too bad, Magnusson had been sympathetic. He was the  Chief of Terran Intelligence on Wolf, and I was next in line for his  job, but he understood when I quit. He'd arranged the transfer and the  pass, and I was leaving tonight.    I was nearly back to the spaceport by now, across from the street-shrine  at the edge of the square. It was here that the little toy-seller had  vanished. But it was exactly like a thousand, a hundred thousand other  such street-shrines on Wolf, a smudge of incense reeking and stinking  before the squatting image of Nebran, the Toad God whose face and symbol  are everywhere on Wolf. I stared for a moment at the ugly idol, then  slowly moved away.    The lighted curtains of the spaceport cafe attracted my attention and I  went inside. A few spaceport personnel in storm gear were drinking  coffee at the counter, a pair of furred _chaks_, lounging beneath the  mirrors at the far end, and a trio of Dry-towners, rangy, weathered men  in crimson and blue shirt cloaks, were standing at a wall shelf, eating  Terran food with aloof dignity.    In my business clothes I felt more conspicuous than the _chaks_. What  place had a civilian here, between the uniforms of the spacemen and the  colorful brilliance of the Dry-towners?    A snub-nosed girl with alabaster hair came to take my order. I asked for  _jaco_ and bunlets, and carried the food to a wall shelf near the  Dry-towners. Their dialect fell soft and familiar on my ears. One of  them, without altering the expression on his face or the easy tone of  his voice, began to make elaborate comments on my entrance, my  appearance, my ancestry and probably personal habits, all defined in the  colorfully obscene dialect of Shainsa.    That had happened before. The Wolfan sense of humor is only half-human.  The finest joke is to criticize and insult a stranger, preferably an  Earthman, to his very face, in an unknown language, perfectly deadpan.  In my civilian clothes I was obviously fair game.    A look or gesture of resentment would have lost face and dignity--what  the Dry-towners call their _kihar_--permanently. I leaned over and  remarked in their own dialect that I would, at some future and  unspecified time, appreciate the opportunity to return their  compliments.    By rights they should have laughed, made some barbed remark about my  command of language and crossed their hands in symbol of a jest decently  reversed on themselves. Then we would have bought each other a drink,  and that would be that.    But it didn't happen that way. Not this time. The tallest of the three  whirled, upsetting his drink in the process. I heard its thin shatter  through the squeal of the alabaster-haired girl, as a chair crashed  over. They faced me three abreast, and one of them fumbled in the clasp  of his shirtcloak.    I edged backward, my own hand racing up for a skean I hadn't carried in  six years, and fronted them squarely, hoping I could face down the  prospect of a roughhouse. They wouldn't kill me, this close to the HQ,  but at least I was in for an unpleasant mauling. I couldn't handle three  men; and if nerves were this taut in the Kharsa, I might get knifed.  Quite by accident, of course.    The _chaks_ moaned and gibbered. The Dry-towners glared at me and I  tensed for the moment when their steady stare would explode into  violence.    Then I became aware that they were gazing, not at me, but at something  or someone behind me. The skeans snicked back into the clasps of their  cloaks.    Then they broke rank, turned and ran. They _ran_, blundering into  stools, leaving havoc of upset benches and broken crockery in their  wake. One man barged into the counter, swore and ran on, limping. I let  my breath go. Something had put the fear of God into those brutes, and  it wasn't my own ugly mug. I turned and saw the girl.    She was slight, with waving hair like spun black glass, circled with  faint tracery of stars. A black glass belt bound her narrow waist like  clasped hands, and her robe, stark white, bore an ugly embroidery across  the breasts, the flat sprawl of a conventionalized Toad God, Nebran. Her  features were delicate, chiseled, pale; a Dry-town face, all human, all  woman, but set in an alien and unearthly repose. The great eyes gleamed  red. They were fixed, almost unseeing, but the crimson lips were curved  with inhuman malice.    She stood motionless, looking at me as if wondering why I had not run  with the others. In half a second, the smile flickered off and was  replaced by a startled look of--recognition?    Whoever and whatever she was, she had saved me a mauling. I started to  phrase formal thanks, then broke off in astonishment. The cafe had  emptied and we were entirely alone. Even the _chaks_ had leaped through  an open window--I saw the whisk of a disappearing tail.    We stood frozen, looking at one another while the Toad God sprawled  across her breasts rose and fell for half a dozen breaths.    Then I took one step forward, and she took one step backward, at the  same instant. In one swift movement she was outside in the dark street.  It took me only an instant to get into the street after her, but as I  stepped across the door there was a little stirring in the air, like the  rising of heat waves across the salt flats at noon. Then the  street-shrine was empty, and nowhere was there any sign of the girl. She  had vanished. She simply was not there.    I gaped at the empty shrine. She had stepped inside and vanished, like a  wraith of smoke, like--    --Like the little toy-seller they had hunted out of the Kharsa.    There were eyes in the street again and, becoming aware of where I was,  I moved away. The shrines of Nebran are on every corner of Wolf, but  this is one instance when familiarity does not breed contempt. The  street was dark and seemed empty, but it was packed with all the little  noises of living. I was not unobserved. And meddling with a  street-shrine would be just as dangerous as the skeans of my three  loud-mouthed Dry-town roughnecks.    I turned and crossed the square for the last time, turning toward the  loom of the spaceship, filing the girl away as just another riddle of  Wolf I'd never solve.    How wrong I was!          CHAPTER THREE      From the spaceport gates, exchanging brief greetings with the guards, I  took a last look at the Kharsa. For a minute I toyed with the notion of  just disappearing down one of those streets. It's not hard to disappear  on Wolf, if you know how. And I knew, or had known once. Loyalty to  Terra? What had Terra given me except a taste of color and adventure,  out there in the Dry-towns, and then taken it away again?    If an Earthman is very lucky and very careful, he lasts about ten years  in Intelligence. I had had two years more than my share. I still knew  enough to leave my Terran identity behind like a worn-out jacket. I  could seek out Rakhal, settle our blood-feud, see Juli again....    How could I see Juli again? As her husband's murderer? No other way.  Blood-feud on Wolf is a terrible and elaborate ritual of the code  duello. And once I stepped outside the borders of Terran law, sooner or  later Rakhal and I would meet. And one of us would die.    I looked back, just once, at the dark rambling streets away from the  square. Then I turned toward the blue-white lights that hurt my eyes,  and the starship that loomed, huge and hateful, before me.    A steward in white took my fingerprint and led me to a coffin-sized  chamber. He brought me coffee and sandwiches--I hadn't, after all, eaten  in the spaceport cafe--then got me into the skyhook and strapped me,  deftly and firmly, into the acceleration cushions, tugging at the  Garensen belts until I ached all over. A long needle went into my  arm--the narcotic that would keep me safely drowsy all through the  terrible tug of interstellar acceleration.    Doors clanged, buzzers vibrated lower down in the ship, men tramped the  corridors calling to one another in the language of the spaceports. I  understood one word in four. I shut my eyes, not caring. At the end of  the trip there would be another star, another world, another language.  Another life.    I had spent all my adult life on Wolf. Juli had been a child under the  red star. But it was a pair of wide crimson eyes and black hair combed  into ringlets like spun black glass that went down with me into the  bottomless pit of sleep....           *       *       *       *       *    Someone was shaking me.    \"Ah, come on, Cargill. Wake up, man. Shake your boots!\"    My mouth, foul-tasting and stiff, fumbled at the shapes of words. \"Wha'  happened? Wha' y' want?\" My eyes throbbed. When I got them open I saw  two men in black leathers bending over me. We were still inside gravity.    \"Get out of the skyhook. You're coming with us.\"    \"Wha'--\" Even through the layers of the sedative, that got to me. Only a  criminal, under interstellar law, can be removed from a passage-paid  starship once he has formally checked in on board. I was legally, at  this moment, on my \"planet of destination.\"    \"I haven't been charged--\"    \"Did I say you had?\" snapped one man.    \"Shut up, he's doped,\" the other said hurriedly. \"Look,\" he continued,  pronouncing every word loudly and distinctly, \"get up now, and come with  us. The co-ordinator will hold up blastoff if we don't get off in three  minutes, and Operations will scream. Come on, please.\"    Then I was stumbling along the lighted, empty corridor, swaying between  the two men, foggily realizing the crew must think me a fugitive caught  trying to leave the planet.
