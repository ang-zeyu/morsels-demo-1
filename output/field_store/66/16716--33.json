All this work  of complicated and refined observation, sometimes lasting months and  years, results in a monograph containing minute descriptions of  organs, of cells, and of intra-cellular structures, the whole  represented and defined in words and pictures. Now, these descriptions  and drawings are the display of the various sensations which the  zoologist has experienced in the course of his labours; to those  sensations are added the very numerous interpretations derived from  the memory, reasoning, and often, also, from the imagination on the  part of the scholar, the last a source at once of errors and of  discoveries. But everything properly experimental in the work of the  zoologist proceeds from the sensations he has felt or might have felt,  and in the particular case treated of, these sensations are almost  solely visual.    This observation might be repeated with regard to all objects of the  outer world which enter into relation with us. Whether the knowledge  of them be of the common-place or of a scientific order matters  little. Sensation is its limit, and all objects are known to us by  the sensations they produce in us, and are known to us solely in this  manner. A landscape is nothing but a cluster of sensations. The  outward form of a body is simply sensation; and the innermost and most  delicate material structure, the last visible elements of a cell, for  example, are all, in so far as we observe them with the microscope,  nothing but sensation.    This being understood, the question is, why we have just  admitted--with the majority of authors--that we cannot really know a  single object as it is in itself, and in its own nature, otherwise  than by the intermediary of the sensations it provokes in us? This  comes back to saying that we here require explanations on the two  following points: why do we admit that we do not really perceive the  objects, but only something intermediate between them and us; and why  do we call this something intermediate a sensation? On this second  point I will offer, for the time being, one simple remark: we use the  term sensation for lack of any other to express the intermediate  character of our perception of objects; and this use does not, on our  part, imply any hypothesis. Especially do we leave completely in  suspense the question whether sensation is a material phenomenon or a  state of being of the mind. These are questions we will deal with  later. For the present it must be understood that the word sensation  is simply a term for the something intermediate between the object and  our faculty of cognition.[3] We have, therefore, simply to state why  we have admitted that the external perception of objects is produced  mediately or by procuration.    There are a few philosophers, and those not of the lowest rank, who have  thought that this intermediate character of all perception was so  evident that there was no need to insist further upon it. John Stuart  Mill, who was certainly and perhaps more than anything a careful  logician, commences an exposition of the idealist thesis to which he was  so much attached, by carelessly saying: \"It goes without saying that  objects are known to us through the intermediary of our senses.... The  senses are equivalent to our sensations;\"[4] and on those propositions  he rears his whole system, \"It goes without saying ...\" is a trifle  thoughtless. I certainly think he was wrong in not testing more  carefully the solidity of his starting point.    In the first place, this limit set to our knowledge of the objects  which stimulate our sensations is only accepted without difficulty by  well-informed persons; it much astonishes the uninstructed when first  explained to them. And this astonishment, although it may seem so, is  not a point that can be neglected, for it proves that, in the first  and simple state of our knowledge, we believe we directly perceive  objects as they are. Now, if we, the cultured class, have, for the  most part,[5] abandoned this primitive belief, we have only done so on  certain implicit conditions, of which we must take cognisance. This is  what I shall now demonstrate as clearly as I can.    Take the case of an unlearned person. To prove to him that he knows  sensations alone and not the bodies which excite them, a very striking  argument may be employed which requires no subtle reasoning and which  appeals to his observation. This is to inform him, supposing he is not  aware of the fact, that, every time he has the perception of an  exterior object, there is something interposed between the object and  himself, and that that something is his nervous system.    If we were not acquainted with the existence of our nervous system, we  should unhesitatingly admit that our perception of objects consisted  in some sort of motion towards the places in which they were fixed.  Now, a number of experiments prove to us that objects are known to us  as excitants of our nervous system which only act on this system by  entering into communication, or coming into contact with, its terminal  extremities. They then produce, in the interior of this system, a  peculiar modification which we are not yet able to define. It is this  modification which follows the course of the nerves and is carried to  the central parts of the system. The speed of the propagation of this  nerve modification has been measured by certain precise experiments in  psychometry; the journey is made slowly, at the rate of 20 to 30  metres per second, and it is of interest that this rate of speed lets  us know at what moment and, consequently, by what organic excitement,  the phenomenon of consciousness is produced. This happens when the  cerebral centres are affected; the phenomenon of consciousness is  therefore posterior to the fact of the physical excitement.    I believe it has required a long series of accepted observations for  us to have arrived at this idea, now so natural in appearance, that  the modifications produced within our nervous system are the only  states of which we can have a direct consciousness; and as  experimental demonstration is always limited, there can be no absolute  certainty that things never happen otherwise, that we never go outside  ourselves, and that neither our consciousness nor our nervous influx  can exteriorise itself, shoot beyond our material organs, and travel  afar in pursuit of objects in order to know or to modify them.           *       *       *       *       *    Before going further, we must make our terminology more precise. We  have just seen the necessity of drawing a distinction between the  sensations of which we are conscious and the unknown cause which  produces these sensations by acting on our nervous systems. This  exciting cause I have several times termed, in order to be understood,  the external object. But under the name of external object are  currently designated groups of sensations, such as those which make up  for us a chair, a tree, an animal, or any kind of body. I see a dog  pass in the street. I call this dog an external object; but, as this  dog is formed, for me who am looking at it, of my sensations, and as  these sensations are states of my nervous centres, it happens that the  term external object has two meanings. Sometimes it designates our  sensations; at another, the exciting cause of our sensations. To avoid  all confusion we will call this exciting cause, which is unknown to  us, the _X_ of matter.    It is, however, not entirely unknown, for we at least know two facts  with regard to it. We know, first, that this _X_ exists, and in the  second place, that its image must not be sought in the sensations it  excites in us. How can we doubt, we say, that it exists? The same  external observation proves to us at once that there exists an object  distinct from our nerves, and that our nerves separate us from it. I  insist on this point, for the reason that some authors, after having  unreservedly admitted that our knowledge is confined to sensations,  have subsequently been hard put to it to demonstrate the reality of  the excitant distinct from the sensations.[6] Of this we need no  demonstration, and the testimony of our senses suffices. We have seen  the excitant, and it is like a friend who should pass before us in  disguise so well costumed and made up that we can attribute to his  real self nothing of what we see of him, but yet we know that it is  he.    And, in fact, let us remember what it is that we have argued  upon--viz. on an observation. I look at my hand, and I see an object  approaching it which gives me a sensation of feeling. I at first say  that this object is an excitant. It is pointed out to me that I am in  error. This object, which appears to me outside my nervous system, is  composed, I am told, of sensations. Be it so, I have the right to  answer; but if all that I perceive is sensation, my nervous system  itself is a sensation; if it is only that, it is no longer an  intermediary between the excitant and myself, and it is the fact that  we perceive things as they are. For it to be possible to prove that I  perceive, not the object, but that _tertium quid_ which is sensation,  it has to be admitted that the nervous system is a reality external to  sensation and that objects which assume, in relation to it, the role  of excitants and of which we perceive the existence, are likewise  realities external to sensation.

Though she didn't  make the slightest sound, all at once Frisky Squirrel's nose twitched  again, as he muttered to himself, \"There's a very queer smell about  these beechnut shucks!\"    He was sitting on the edge of the stone doorstep with a bit of beechnut  clutched in his paws. And when he looked up and saw somebody's nose  appear in the doorway he tumbled right over backward. The only sound he  made came from the beechnut shuck, which made a faint click as it fell  upon the stone. And Miss Kitty Cat's sharp ears caught it.          VII    TWO IN A TREE      WHEN Miss Kitty Cat dashed out of the woodshed Frisky Squirrel was two  jumps ahead of her. That was really a better lead than it sounds. Frisky  was always a good jumper. And the more scared he was, the further he  could leap. Anybody that knew him well would have known then--just to  see him--that something had given him a great fright.    First he had noticed a strange smell. Next he had seen a strange nose  come stealing out of the woodshed door. And not knowing who was going to  follow that nose, Frisky Squirrel felt that the sooner he climbed a  tree the better it would be for him. So he made for a tall elm that  wasn't too far away.    Though Miss Kitty Cat was a fast runner, Frisky reached the foot of the  tree ahead of her. And he was half way to the lowest branches before he  took a real look at his pursuer.    To his dismay he saw that the creature hadn't stopped at the foot of the  tree. The monster had already begun climbing after him. Frisky had never  seen any one just like this fierce person. One look was enough for him.  He pushed higher and higher into the tree-top and crept far out on a  drooping limb, which swayed beneath his weight as he clung to it.    There he paused, while he watched to see what the stranger would do. And  as he stared at the creature he remembered suddenly what Mr. Crow had  told him. \"There's a cat at the farmhouse,\" the old gentleman had said.    \"This must be the cat,\" Frisky thought. And to her he called, \"If you're  the cat, don't come any nearer, madam! You might get hurt.\" For he  remembered, too, that he had told Mr. Crow that he wouldn't harm the  cat.    \"It _is_ the cat,\" he said to himself presently, \"for she has stopped.\"    Miss Kitty Cat did not quite dare follow Frisky Squirrel to the tip  where he swung. She crouched upon the branch a little way from him,  where it was safer for her, and with switching tail and bristling  whiskers waited to see what he would do next.    \"It makes me uneasy to see you swaying so,\" she told Frisky. \"Besides,  you're shaking this limb. And I don't like it.\"    \"She's a fussy creature--this cat!\" Frisky said to himself. \"I promised  Mr. Crow I wouldn't hurt her; but I didn't promise him that I wouldn't  tease her.\" So he bobbed up and down with all his might.    \"Stop!\" cried Miss Kitty Cat. \"That's a very reckless thing to do. It's  like rocking the boat.\"    \"I think it's the finest sport in the world,\" Frisky chuckled.    \"I know a finer,\" Miss Kitty snarled.    \"What that?\" he asked her.    \"If I could get my claws on you I'd soon show you,\" she told him grimly.    Somehow there was something about her remark that startled Frisky  Squirrel--something that made him shiver. And when he shivered he lost  his hold. Down he dropped, slipping and floundering from one branch to  another.    And down Miss Kitty Cat followed him.          VIII    NINE LIVES      FRISKY SQUIRREL was much more at home in the trees than Miss Kitty Cat  was. While Frisky managed at last to cling to a limb and right himself,  Miss Kitty lost her footing and fell out of the tree completely.    \"Oh! She'll he hurt!\" Frisky cried as he saw her turning and twisting  through the air. But to his great surprise she struck with all her four  feet on the ground, quite unharmed. \"You did that very nicely,\" he  called to her generously.    But she didn't answer. To tell the truth, she felt rather foolish  because she had fallen out of the tree. And she walked back to the  woodshed and stalked through the doorway without saying a word.    After that adventure Frisky Squirrel decided to go back home. So he  scurried town the tree-trunk and scampered to the stone wall, and  scooted along the top of it.    Old Mr. Crow was watching for him. And as before, he dropped down near  the wall to talk.    \"I hardly expected to see you again,\" Mr. Crow remarked. \"You couldn't  have met the cat.\"    \"Yes!\" said Frisky. \"I met her. She followed me up a tree. And it's a  wonder she didn't get hurt, though I was careful of her. She had a fall;  but she landed beautifully.\"    Old Mr. Crow nodded wisely.    \"She always lands on her feet,\" he observed. \"And you needn't worry  about her,\" he added. \"You know, they say she has nine lives.\"    \"Nine lives!\" Frisky Squirrel exclaimed. \"What do you mean, Mr. Crow?\"    Now, Mr. Crow really knew a great deal, because he had lived many years.  And he pretended to know still more, because he liked to appear learned.  But this question was a puzzler for him. He simply couldn't answer it.    \"You wouldn't understand, even if I explained,\" he told Frisky Squirrel.  And then he flew away, leaving Frisky to run home and wonder what it  meant to have nine lives.    As for Mr. Crow, he suddenly made up his mind that he would find out  about Miss Kitty Cat's nine lives. He would ask that lady herself. So he  flapped himself over to the big elm in the farmyard, where he cawed and  cawed, hoping that Miss Kitty Cat would appear to see what all the noise  was about.    And sure enough! she soon bounced out of the woodshed door and looked up  at Mr. Crow inquiringly.    \"I've been hearing a good deal about; you,\" Mr. Crow called down to her  in what he considered his sweetest tones, though anybody else would have  said they were quite hoarse. \"I know you always manage to land on your  feet--and I can understand that. But what's this I hear about _nine  lives?_\"    Miss Kitty Cat only stared at him.    \"Perhaps you don't feel like talking,\" said Mr. Crow. \"If you've just  had a fall, maybe you're still a bit shaken up, even if you did land on  your feet. Perhaps you'd rather I came back later.\"    Miss Kitty Cat suddenly found her voice.    \"You've been gossiping with that young squirrel!\" she snapped. \"I'll  have you know that I'm not shaken up at all. But I'd shake you up if I  could get hold of you!\"    Mr. Crow was astonished. He was sure he had been most polite. Yet here  was Miss Kitty Cat as rude as she could be!    He amused himself by jeering at her until she turned her back on him and  went inside the woodshed. And he had to go away without learning  anything at all about the nine lives of Miss Kitty Cat. They always  remained a deep mystery. Everybody agreed that the number was nine. But  beyond that, nobody could explain about them.          IX    THE STOLEN CREAM      \"I DECLARE!\" Farmer Green's wife cried one day. \"Somebody's been  stealing my cream in the buttery.\"    The buttery was a big bare room on the shady side of the house, where  great pans of milk stood on a long table. When the cream was thick  enough on the milk Mrs. Green skimmed it off and put it in cans. At one  end of the buttery there was a trap door in the floor. When the trap was  raised you could look right down into a well. And into its cool depths  Mrs. Green dropped her cans of cream by means of a rope, which she  fastened to a beam under the floor, so the tops of the cans would stay  out of the water.    Mrs. Green made butter out of that cream. So it was no wonder she was  upset when she discovered that some one had meddled with one of her pans  of milk.    \"It can't be the cat,\" said Farmer Green's wife. \"The buttery door has  been shut tight all the time.\"    Miss Kitty Cat was right there in the kitchen while Mrs. Green was  talking to her husband. And it was easy to see that Miss Kitty agreed  with her mistress. She came close to Mrs. Green and purred, saying quite  plainly that she was a good, honest cat and that she deserved to be  petted. At least, that was what Mrs. Green understood her to mean.    Often, after that, Mrs. Green discovered traces of the thief in the  buttery. Flecks of cream on the side of a milk pan, drops of cream on  the table, smudges of cream now and then on the floor! Such signs meant  something. But Farmer Green's wife couldn't decide what.    And another strange thing happened. Miss Kitty Cat lost her appetite for  milk. She would leave her saucer of milk untasted on the kitchen floor.    Now and then Mrs. Green picked Miss Kitty up and looked closely at her  face. At such times Miss Kitty purred pleasantly. She did not seem to be  the least bit disturbed.    One evening, after dark, Johnnie Green went into the buttery to get a  pail. The moment he opened the door there was a crash and a clatter  inside the room.    Johnnie jumped back quickly.    \"There's somebody in the buttery!\" he shouted.    But when his father brought a light they found no one there. A tin  dipper lay on the floor.    \"When you opened the door it must have jarred the dipper off the edge of  the table,\" said Farmer Green.    \"_Meaow!_\" said a voice behind them. There stood Miss Kitty Cat, saying  that everything _must_ have happened exactly as Farmer Green said.    \"She couldn't have been in here, could she?\" Farmer Green puzzled.  \"Come, Kitty!\" And he picked up Miss Kitty and held her where the light  fell full upon her face. \"Clean as a whistle!\" said Farmer Green. \"I  guess she just followed us in.\" He set her down again. And once more,  with a plaintive _meaow_ she agreed with him perfectly.          X    A CREAMY FACE      FARMER GREEN'S wife threw away pan after pan of milk, because she knew  somebody had been stealing cream off the top of them. At least, she told  Farmer Green to feed the milk to the pigs, because she wasn't going to  make butter of"]]]
