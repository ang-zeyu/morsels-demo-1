Peter Rabbit and Jumper the Hare rolled up a great, tender, fresh  cabbage.    Boomer the Nighthawk said that he was very sorry, but he was on a diet  of insects, which he must swallow one at a time, so to save trouble he  had swallowed them as he caught them.    Now Hooty the Owl is a glutton and is lazy.  \"Reddy Fox and Jimmy Skunk  and Billy Mink are sure to bring somethink [Transcriber's note:  something?] I like, so what is the use of spending my time hunting for  what someone else will get for me?\" said he to himself.  So Hooty the  Owl went very early to the Lone Pine and hid among the thick branches  where no one could see him.    Shadow the Weasel is sly and a thief and lives by his wits.  So because  he had rather steal than be honest, he too went to the midnight spread  with nothing but his appetite.    Now Reddy Fox is also a glutton and very, very crafty.  When he saw the  plump duck brought by Billy Mink, his mouth watered, for Reddy Fox is  very, very fond of young spring ducks.  So straightway he began to plan  how he could get possession of Billy Mink's duck.    And when Billy Mink saw the fat trout Little Joe Otter had brought, his  eyes danced and his heart swelled with envy, for Billy Mink is very,  very fond of fish.  At once he began to plan how he could secure that  particular fat trout Little Joe Otter guarded so carefully.    Jimmy Skunk was quite contented with the eggs he had stolen from old  Gray Goose--that is, he was until he saw the plump chicken Reddy Fox  had brought from Farmer Brown's dooryard.  Then suddenly his stomach  became very empty, very empty indeed for chicken, and Jimmy Skunk began  to think of a way to add the chicken of Reddy Fox to his own stolen  eggs.    Because Reddy Fox is the largest he was given the place of honor at the  head of the table under the Lone Pine.  On his right sat Little Joe  Otter and on his left Jerry Muskrat.  Shadow the Weasel was next to  Little Joe Otter, while right across from him was Jimmy Skunk.  Peter  Rabbit was next, sitting opposite his cousin, Jumper the Hare.  At the  extreme end, facing Reddy Fox, sat Billy Mink, with the plump duck  right under his sharp little nose.    Boomer the Nighthawk excused himself on the plea that he needed  exercise to aid digestion, and as he had brought nothing to the feast,  his excuse was politely accepted.    Reddy Fox is very, very cunning, and his crafty brain had been busily  working out a plan to get all these good things for himself.  \"Little  brothers of the Green Meadows,\" began Reddy Fox, \"we have met here  to-night for a feast of brotherly love.\"    Reddy Fox paused a moment to look hungrily at Billy Mink's duck.  Billy  Mink cast a longing eye at Little Joe Otter's trout, while Jimmy Skunk  stole an envious glance at Reddy Fox's chicken.    \"But there is one missing to make our joy complete,\" continued Reddy  Fox.  \"Who has seen Bobby Coon?\"    No one had seen Bobby Coon.  Somehow happy-go-lucky Bobby Coon had been  overlooked when the invitations were sent out.    \"I move,\" continued Reddy Fox, \"that because Billy Mink runs swiftly,  and because he knows where Bobby Coon usually is to be found, he be  appointed a committee of one to find Bobby Coon and bring him to the  feast.\"    Now nothing could have been less to the liking of Billy Mink, but there  was nothing for him to do but to yield as gracefully as he could and go  in search of Bobby Coon.    No sooner had Billy Mink disappeared down the Lone Little Path than  Reddy Fox recalled a nest of grouse eggs he had seen that day under a  big hemlock, and he proposed that inasmuch as Jimmy Skunk already wore  stripes for having stolen a nest of eggs from Mrs. Grouse, he was just  the one to go steal these eggs and bring them to the feast.    Of course there was nothing for Jimmy Skunk to do but to yield as  gracefully as he could and go in search of the nest of eggs under the  big hemlock.    No sooner had Jimmy Skunk started off than Reddy Fox remembered a big  shining sucker Farmer Brown's boy had caught that afternoon and tossed  among the rushes beside the Smiling Pool.  Little Joe Otter listened  and his mouth watered and watered until he could sit still no longer.  \"If you please,\" said Little Joe Otter, \"I'll run down to the Smiling  Pool and get that sucker to add to the feast.\"    No sooner was Little Joe Otter out of sight than Reddy Fox was reminded  of a field of carrots on the other side of the Green Meadows.  Now  Peter Rabbit and Jumper the Hare are very fond of tender young carrots  and they volunteered to bring a supply for the feast.  So away they  hurried with big jumps down the Lone Little Path and out across the  Green Meadows.    No sooner were Peter Rabbit and Jumper the Hare fairly started than  Reddy Fox began to tell of some luscious sweet apples he had noticed  under a wild apple tree a little way back on the hill.  Now Jerry  Muskrat is quite as fond of luscious sweet apples as of fresh-water  clams, so quietly slipping away, he set out in quest of the wild apple  tree a little way back on the hill.    No sooner was Jerry Muskrat lost in the black shadows than Reddy Fox  turned to speak to Shadow the Weasel.  But Shadow the Weasel believes  that a feast in the stomach is worth two banquets untasted, so while  the others had been talking, he had quietly sucked dry the three big  eggs stolen by Jimmy Skunk from old Gray Goose, and then because he is  so slim and so quick and so sly, he slipped away without anyone seeing  him.    So when Reddy Fox turned to speak to Shadow the Weasel, he found  himself alone.  At least he thought himself alone, and he smiled a  wicked, selfish smile as he walked over to Billy Mink's duck.  He was  thinking how smart he had been to get rid of all the others, and of how  he would enjoy the feast all by himself.    As Reddy Fox stooped to pick up Billy Mink's duck, a great shadow  dropped softly, oh so softly, out of the Lone Pine down onto the plump  chicken.  Then without the teeniest, weeniest bit of noise, it floated  back into the Lone Pine and with it went the plump chicken.    Reddy Fox, still with his wicked, selfish smile, trotted back with  Billy Mink's duck, but he dropped it in sheer surprise when he  discovered that his plump chicken had disappeared.  Now Reddy Fox is  very suspicious, as people who are not honest themselves are very apt  to be.  So he left Billy Mink's duck where he had dropped it and  trotted very, very softly up the Lone Little Path to try to catch the  thief who had stolen his plump chicken.    No sooner was his back turned than down out of the Lone Pine floated  the great shadow, and when a minute later Reddy Fox returned, Billy  Mink's duck had also disappeared.    Reddy Fox could hardly believe his eyes.  He didn't smile now.  He was  too angry and too frightened.  Yes, Reddy Fox was frightened.  He  walked in a big circle round and round the place where the plump  chicken and the duck had been, and the more he walked, the more  suspicious he became.  He wrinkled and wrinkled his little black nose  in an effort to smell the intruder, but not a whiff could he get.  All  was as still and peaceful as could be.  Little Joe Otter's trout lay  shining in the moonlight.  The big head of cabbage lay just where Peter  Rabbit and Jumper the Hare had left it.  Reddy Fox rubbed his eyes to  make sure that he was not dreaming and that the plump chicken and the  duck were not there too.    Just then Bowser the Hound, over at Farmer Brown's, bayed at the moon.  Reddy Fox always is nervous and by this time he was so fidgety that he  couldn't stand still.  When Bowser the Hound bayed at the moon Reddy  Fox jumped a foot off the ground and whirled about in the direction of  Farmer Brown's house.  Then he remembered that Bowser the Hound is  always chained up at night, so that he had nothing to fear from him.    After listening and looking a moment Reddy Fox decided that all was  safe.  \"Well,\" said he to himself, \"I'll have that fat trout anyway,\"  and turned to get it.    But the fat trout he had seen a minute before shining in the moonlight  had also disappeared.  Reddy Fox looked and looked until his eyes  nearly popped out of his head.  Then he did what all cowards do--ran  home as fast as his legs could carry him.    Now of course Billy Mink didn't find Bobby Coon, and when he came back  up the Lone Little Path he was very tired, very hungry and very cross.  And of course Jimmy Skunk failed to find the nest of Mrs. Grouse, and  Little Joe Otter could find no trace of the shining big sucker among  the rushes beside the Smiling Pool.  They also were very tired, very  hungry and very cross.    When the three returned to the Lone Pine and found nothing there but  the big head of cabbage, which none of them liked, the empty egg shells  of old Gray Goose and Jerry Muskrat's clams, they straightway fell to  accusing each other of having stolen the duck and the fat trout and the  eggs and began to quarrel dreadfully.    Pretty soon up came Peter Rabbit and Jumper the Hare, who had failed to  find the tender young carrots.  And up came Jerry Muskrat, who had  found no luscious sweet apples.    \"Where is Reddy Fox?\" asked Peter Rabbit.    Sure enough, where was Reddy Fox?  Billy Mink and Little Joe Otter and  Jimmy Skunk stopped quarreling and looked at each other.    \"Reddy Fox is the thief!\" they cried all together.    Peter Rabbit and Jumper the Hare and Jerry Muskrat agreed that Reddy  Fox must be the thief, and had sent them all away on false errands that  he might have the feast all to himself.    So because there was nothing else to do, Billy Mink and Little Joe  Otter, tired and hungry and angry, started for their homes beside the  Laughing Brook.  And Jimmy Skunk, also tired and hungry and angry,  started off up the Crooked Little Path to look"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20885"],[0,"The Promised Land (#3)"],[1,"the Parphens, of whom my grandfather rented his  store. They treated us as if we were not Jews at all. On our festival  days they visited our house and brought us presents, carefully  choosing such things as Jewish children might accept; and they liked  to have everything explained to them, about the wine and the fruit and  the candles, and they even tried to say the appropriate greetings and  blessings in Hebrew. My father used to say that if all the Russians  were like the Parphens, there would be no trouble between Gentiles and  Jews; and Fedora Pavlovna, the landlady, would reply that the Russian  _people_ were not to blame. It was the priests, she said, who taught  the people to hate the Jews. Of course she knew best, as she was a  very pious Christian. She never passed a church without crossing  herself.    The Gentiles were always crossing themselves; when they went into a  church, and when they came out, when they met a priest, or passed an  image in the street. The dirty beggars on the church steps never  stopped crossing themselves; and even when they stood on the corner of  a Jewish street, and received alms from Jewish people, they crossed  themselves and mumbled Christian prayers. In every Gentile house there  was what they called an \"icon,\" which was an image or picture of the  Christian god, hung up in a corner, with a light always burning before  it. In front of the icon the Gentiles said their prayers, on their  knees, crossing themselves all the time.    I tried not to look in the corner where the icon was, when I came into  a Gentile house. I was afraid of the cross. Everybody was, in  Polotzk--all the Jews, I mean. For it was the cross that made the  priests, and the priests made our troubles, as even some Christians  admitted. The Gentiles said that we had killed their God, which was  absurd, as they never had a God--nothing but images. Besides, what  they accused us of had happened so long ago; the Gentiles themselves  said it was long ago. Everybody had been dead for ages who could have  had anything to do with it. Yet they put up crosses everywhere, and  wore them on their necks, on purpose to remind themselves of these  false things; and they considered it pious to hate and abuse us,  insisting that we had killed their God. To worship the cross and to  torment a Jew was the same thing to them. That is why we feared the  cross.    Another thing the Gentiles said about us was that we used the blood of  murdered Christian children at the Passover festival. Of course that  was a wicked lie. It made me sick to think of such a thing. I knew  everything that was done for Passover, from the time I was a very  little girl. The house was made clean and shining and holy, even in  the corners where nobody ever looked. Vessels and dishes that were  used all the year round were put away in the garret, and special  vessels were brought out for the Passover week. I used to help unpack  the new dishes, and find my own blue mug. When the fresh curtains were  put up, and the white floors were uncovered, and everybody in the  house put on new clothes, and I sat down to the feast in my new dress,  I felt clean inside and out. And when I asked the Four Questions,  about the unleavened bread and the bitter herbs and the other things,  and the family, reading from their books, answered me, did I not know  all about Passover, and what was on the table, and why? It was wicked  of the Gentiles to tell lies about us. The youngest child in the house  knew how Passover was kept.    The Passover season, when we celebrated our deliverance from the land  of Egypt, and felt so glad and thankful, as if it had only just  happened, was the time our Gentile neighbors chose to remind us that  Russia was another Egypt. That is what I heard people say, and it was  true. It was not so bad in Polotzk, within the Pale; but in Russian  cities, and even more in the country districts, where Jewish families  lived scattered, by special permission of the police, who were always  changing their minds about letting them stay, the Gentiles made the  Passover a time of horror for the Jews. Somebody would start up that  lie about murdering Christian children, and the stupid peasants would  get mad about it, and fill themselves with vodka, and set out to kill  the Jews. They attacked them with knives and clubs and scythes and  axes, killed them or tortured them, and burned their houses. This was  called a \"pogrom.\" Jews who escaped the pogroms came to Polotzk with  wounds on them, and horrible, horrible stories, of little babies torn  limb from limb before their mothers' eyes. Only to hear these things  made one sob and sob and choke with pain. People who saw such things  never smiled any more, no matter how long they lived; and sometimes  their hair turned white in a day, and some people became insane on the  spot.    Often we heard that the pogrom was led by a priest carrying a cross  before the mob. Our enemies always held up the cross as the excuse of  their cruelty to us. I never was in an actual pogrom, but there were  times when it threatened us, even in Polotzk; and in all my fearful  imaginings, as I hid in dark corners, thinking of the horrible things  the Gentiles were going to do to me, I saw the cross, the cruel cross.    I remember a time when I thought a pogrom had broken out in our  street, and I wonder that I did not die of fear. It was some Christian  holiday, and we had been warned by the police to keep indoors. Gates  were locked; shutters were barred. If a child cried, the nurse  threatened to give it to the priest, who would soon be passing by.  Fearful and yet curious, we looked through the cracks in the  shutters. We saw a procession of peasants and townspeople, led by a  number of priests, carrying crosses and banners and images. In the  place of honor was carried a casket, containing a relic from the  monastery in the outskirts of Polotzk. Once a year the Gentiles  paraded with this relic, and on that occasion the streets were  considered too holy for Jews to be about; and we lived in fear till  the end of the day, knowing that the least disturbance might start a  riot, and a riot lead to a pogrom.    On the day when I saw the procession through a crack in the shutter,  there were soldiers and police in the street. This was as usual, but I  did not know it. I asked the nurse, who was pressing to the crack over  my head, what the soldiers were for. Thoughtlessly she answered me,  \"In case of a pogrom.\" Yes, there were the crosses and the priests and  the mob. The church bells were pealing their loudest. Everything was  ready. The Gentiles were going to tear me in pieces, with axes and  knives and ropes. They were going to burn me alive. The cross--the  cross! What would they do to me first?    There was one thing the Gentiles might do to me worse than burning or  rending. It was what was done to unprotected Jewish children who fell  into the hands of priests or nuns. They might baptize me. That would  be worse than death by torture. Rather would I drown in the Dvina than  a drop of the baptismal water should touch my forehead. To be forced  to kneel before the hideous images, to kiss the cross,--sooner would I  rush out to the mob that was passing, and let them tear my vitals out.  To forswear the One God, to bow before idols,--rather would I be  seized with the plague, and be eaten up by vermin. I was only a little  girl, and not very brave; little pains made me ill, and I cried. But  there was no pain that I would not bear--no, none--rather than submit  to baptism.    Every Jewish child had that feeling. There were stories by the dozen  of Jewish boys who were kidnapped by the Czar's agents and brought up  in Gentile families, till they were old enough to enter the army,  where they served till forty years of age; and all those years the  priests tried, by bribes and daily tortures, to force them to accept  baptism, but in vain. This was in the time of Nicholas I, but men who  had been through this service were no older than my grandfather, when  I was a little girl; and they told their experiences with their own  lips, and one knew it was true, and it broke one's heart with pain and  pride.    Some of these soldiers of Nicholas, as they were called, were taken as  little boys of seven or eight--snatched from their mothers' laps. They  were carried to distant villages, where their friends could never  trace them, and turned over to some dirty, brutal peasant, who used  them like slaves and kept them with the pigs. No two were ever left  together; and they were given false names, so that they were entirely  cut off from their own world. And then the lonely child was turned  over to the priests, and he was flogged and starved and terrified--a  little helpless boy who cried for his mother; but still he refused to  be baptized. The priests promised him good things to eat, and fine  clothes, and freedom from labor; but the boy turned away, and said his  prayers secretly--the Hebrew prayers.    As he grew older, severer tortures were invented for him; still he  refused baptism. By this time he had forgotten his mother's face, and  of his prayers perhaps only the \"Shema\" remained in his memory; but  he was a Jew, and nothing would make him change. After he entered the  army, he was bribed with promises of promotions and honors. He  remained a private, and endured the cruellest discipline. When he was  discharged, at the age of forty, he was a broken man, without a home,  without a clue to his origin, and he spent the rest of his life  wandering among Jewish settlements, searching for his family; hiding  the scars of torture under his rags, begging his way from door to  door. If he were one who had broken down under the cruel torments, and  allowed himself to be baptized, for the sake of a respite, the Church  never let him go again, no matter how loudly he protested that he was  still a Jew.
