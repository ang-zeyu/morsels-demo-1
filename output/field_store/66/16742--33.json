All these disasters were caused by the masters of the vessels mistaking  the south for the north pier, in consequence of having lost sight of  Tynemouth light in the blinding showers.    Of course many lifeboats were out doing good service on the night to  which I have referred, but I pass all that by at present.  The next  chapter will carry you, good reader, into the midst of a pitched battle.        CHAPTER TWO.    DESCRIBES A TREMENDOUS BATTLE AND A GLORIOUS VICTORY.    Before following our brilliant lifeboat--this gaudy, butterfly-like  thing of red, white, and blue--to the field of battle, let me observe  that the boats of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution have several  characteristic qualities, to which reference shall be made hereafter,  and that they are of various sizes.  [A full and graphic account of the  Royal National Lifeboat Institution--its boats, its work, and its  achievements--may be found in an interesting volume by its late  secretary, Richard Lewis, Esquire, entitled _History of the Lifeboat and  its Work_--published by Macmillan and Company.]    One of the largest size is that of Ramsgate.  This may be styled a  privileged boat, for it has a steam-tug to wait upon it named the Aid.  Day and night the Aid has her fires \"banked up\" to keep her boilers  simmering, so that when the emergency arises, a vigorous thrust of her  giant poker brings them quickly to the boiling point, and she is ready  to take her lifeboat in tow and tug her out to the famed and fatal  Goodwin Sands, which lie about four miles off the coast--opposite to  Ramsgate.    I draw attention to this boat, first because she is exceptionally  situated with regard to frequency of call, the means of going promptly  into action, and success in her work.  Her sister-lifeboats of  Broadstairs and Margate may, indeed, be as often called to act, but they  lack the attendant steamer, and sometimes, despite the skill and courage  of their crews, find it impossible to get out in the teeth of a tempest  with only sail and oar to aid them.    Early in December, 1863, an emigrant ship set sail for the Antipodes;  she was the Fusilier, of London.  It was her last voyage, and fated to  be very short.  The shores of Old England were still in sight, the eyes  of those who sought to \"better their circumstances\" in Australia were  yet wet, and their hearts still full with the grief of parting from  loved ones at home, when one of the most furious storms of the season  caught them and cast their gallant ship upon the dangerous Sands off the  mouth of the Thames.  This happened on the night of the 3rd, which was  intensely dark, as well as bitterly cold.    Who can describe or conceive the scene that ensued! the horror, the  shrieking of women and children, and the yelling of the blast through  the rigging,--for it was an absolute hurricane,--while tons of water  fell over the decks continually, sweeping them from stem to stern.    The Fusilier had struck on that part of the sands named the Girdler.  In  the midst of the turmoil there was but one course open to the crew--  namely, to send forth signals of distress.  Guns were fired, rockets  sent up, and tar-barrels set a-blaze.  Then, during many hours of agony,  they had to wait and pray.    On that same night another good ship struck upon the same sands at a  different point--the Demerara of Greenock--not an emigrant ship, but  freighted with a crew of nineteen souls, including a Trinity pilot.  Tossed like a plaything on the Sands--at that part named the Shingles--  off Margate, the Demerara soon began to break up, and the helpless crew  did as those of the Fusilier had done and were still doing--they  signalled for aid.  But it seemed a forlorn resource.  Through the  thick, driving, murky atmosphere nothing but utter blackness could be  seen, though the blazing of their own tar-barrels revealed, with awful  power, the seething breakers around, which, as if maddened by the  obstruction of the sands, leaped and hissed wildly over them, and  finally crushed their vessel over on its beam-ends.  Swept from the  deck, which was no longer a platform, but, as it were, a sloping wall,  the crew took refuge in the rigging of one of the masts which still held  fast.  The mast overhung the caldron of foam, which seemed to boil and  leap at the crew as if in disappointed fury.    By degrees the hull of the Demerara began to break up.  Her timbers  writhed and snapped under the force of the ever-thundering waves as if  tormented.  The deck was blown out by the confined and compressed air.  The copper began to peel off, the planks to loosen, and soon it became  evident that the mast to which the crew were lashed could not long hold  up.  Thus, for ten apparently endless hours the perishing seamen hung  suspended over what seemed to be their grave.  They hung thus in the  midst of pitchy darkness after their blazing tar-barrels had been  extinguished.    And what of the lifeboat-men during all this time?  Were they asleep?  Nay, verily!  Everywhere they stood at pierheads, almost torn from their  holdfasts by the furious gale, or they cowered under the lee of boats  and boat-houses on the beach, trying to gaze seaward through the  blinding storm, but nothing whatever could they see of the disasters on  these outlying sands.    There are, however, several sentinels which mount guard night and day  close to the Goodwin and other Sands.  These are the Floating Lights  which mark the position of our extensive and dangerous shoals.  Two of  these sentinels, the Tongue lightship and the Prince's lightship, in the  vicinity of the Girdler Sands, saw the signals of distress.  Instantly  their guns and rockets gleamed and thundered intelligence to the shore.  Such signals had been watched for keenly that night by the brave men of  the Margate lifeboat, who instantly went off to the rescue.  But there  are conditions against which human courage and power and will are  equally unavailing.  In the teeth of such a gale from the  west-nor'-west, with the sea driving in thunder straight on the beach,  it was impossible for the Margate boat to put out.  A telegram was  therefore despatched to Ramsgate.  Here, too, as at Broadstairs, and  everywhere else, the heroes of the coast were on the lookout, knowing  well the duties that might be required of them at any moment.    The stout little Aid was lying at the pier with her steam \"up.\"  The  Ramsgate lifeboat was floating quietly in the harbour, and her sturdy  lion-like coxswain, Isaac Jarman, was at the pier-head with some of his  men, watching.  The Ramsgate men had already been out on service at the  sands that day, and their appetite for saving life had been whetted.  They were ready for more work.  At a quarter past eight p.m. the  telegram was received by the harbour-master.  The signal was given.  The  lifeboat-men rushed to their boats.    \"First come, first served,\" is the rule there.  She was over-manned, and  some of the brave fellows had to leave her.  The tight little tug took  the boat in tow, and in less than half an hour rushed out with her into  the intense darkness, right in the teeth of tempest and billows.    The engines of the Aid are powerful, like her whole frame.  Though  fiercely opposed she battled out into the raging sea, now tossed on the  tops of the mighty waves, now swallowed in the troughs between.  Battered by the breaking crests, whelmed at times by \"green seas,\"  staggering like a drunken thing, and buffeted by the fierce gale, but  never giving way an inch, onward, steadily if slowly, until she rounded  the North Foreland.  Then the rescuers saw the signals going up  steadily, regularly, from the two lightships.  No cessation of these  signals until they should be answered by signals from the shore.    All this time the lifeboat had been rushing, surging, and bounding in  the wake of her steamer.  The seas not only roared around her, but  absolutely overwhelmed her.  She was dragged violently over them, and  sometimes right through them.  Her crew crouched almost flat on the  thwarts, and held on to prevent being washed overboard.  The stout cable  had to be let out to its full extent to prevent snapping, so that the  mist and rain sometimes prevented her crew from seeing the steamer,  while cross seas met and hurled her from side to side, causing her to  plunge and kick like a wild horse.    About midnight the Tongue lightship was reached and hailed.  The answer  given was brief and to the point: \"A vessel in distress to the  nor'-west, supposed to be on the high part of the Shingles Sand!\"    Away went the tug and boat to the nor'-west, but no vessel could be  found, though anxious hearts and sharp and practised eyes were strained  to the uttermost.  The captain of the Aid, who knew every foot of the  sands, and who had medals and letters from kings and emperors in  acknowledgment of his valuable services, was not to be balked easily.  He crept along as close to the dangerous sands as was consistent with  the safety of his vessel.    How intently they gazed and listened both from lifeboat and steamer, but  no cry was to be heard, no signal of distress, nothing but the roaring  of the waves and shrieking of the blast, and yet they were not far from  the perishing!  The crew of the Demerara were clinging to their  quivering mast close by, but what could their weak voices avail in such  a storm?  Their signal fires had long before been drowned out, and those  who would have saved them could not see more than a few yards around.    Presently the booming of distant cannon was heard and then a faint line  of fire was seen in the far distance against the black sky.  The  Prince's and the Girdler lightships were both firing guns and rockets to  tell that shipwreck was taking place near to them.  What was"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21721"],[0,"The Coral Island (#3)"],[1,"ore, which we luckily reached without much trouble, for  the water inside the reef is quite calm.\"    \"But the captain and crew, what of them?\"  I inquired anxiously.    Jack shook his head.    \"Are they lost?\"    \"No, they are not lost, I hope; but, I fear, there is not much chance of  their being saved.  The ship struck at the very tail of the island on  which we are cast.  When the boat was tossed into the sea it fortunately  did not upset, although it shipped a good deal of water, and all the men  managed to scramble into it; but before they could get the oars out, the  gale carried them past the point and away to leeward of the island.  After we landed I saw them endeavouring to pull towards us; but as they  had only one pair of oars out of the eight that belonged to the boat,  and as the wind was blowing right in their teeth, they gradually lost  ground.  Then I saw them put about and hoist some sort of sail--a  blanket, I fancy, for it was too small for the boat--and in half-an-hour  they were out of sight.\"    \"Poor fellows!\"  I murmured sorrowfully.    \"But the more I think about it I've better hope of them,\" continued Jack  in a more cheerful tone.  \"You see, Ralph, I've read a great deal about  these South Sea Islands, and I know that in many places they are  scattered about in thousands over the sea, so they're almost sure to  fall in with one of them before long.\"    \"I'm sure I hope so,\" said Peterkin earnestly.  \"But what has become of  the wreck, Jack?  I saw you clambering up the rocks there while I was  watching Ralph.  Did you say she had gone to pieces?\"    \"No, she has not gone to pieces; but she has gone to the bottom,\"  replied Jack.  \"As I said before, she struck on the tail of the island  and stove in her bow; but the next breaker swung her clear, and she  floated away to leeward.  The poor fellows in the boat made a hard  struggle to reach her, but long before they came near her she filled and  went down.  It was after she had foundered that I saw them trying to  pull to the island.\"    There was a long silence after Jack had ceased speaking, and I have no  doubt that each was revolving in his mind our extraordinary position.  For my part, I cannot say that my reflections were very agreeable.  I  knew that we were on an island, for Jack had said so; but whether it was  inhabited or not, I did not know.  If it should be inhabited, I felt  certain, from all I had heard of South Sea Islanders, that we should be  roasted alive and eaten.  If it should turn out to be uninhabited, I  fancied that we should be starved to death.  \"Oh,\" thought I, \"if the  ship had only struck on the rocks we might have done pretty well, for we  could have obtained provisions from her, and tools to enable us to build  a shelter; but now--alas! alas! we are lost!\"  These last words I  uttered aloud in my distress.    \"Lost, Ralph!\" exclaimed Jack, while a smile overspread his hearty  countenance.  \"Saved, you should have said.  Your cogitations seem to  have taken a wrong road, and led you to a wrong conclusion.\"    \"Do you know what conclusion I have come to?\" said Peterkin.  \"I have  made up my mind that it's capital--first-rate--the best thing that ever  happened to us, and the most splendid prospect that ever lay before  three jolly young tars.  We've got an island all to ourselves.  We'll  take possession in the name of the king.  We'll go and enter the service  of its black inhabitants.  Of course we'll rise, naturally, to the top  of affairs: white men always do in savage countries.  You shall be king,  Jack; Ralph, prime minister; and I shall be--\"    \"The court-jester,\" interrupted Jack.    \"No,\" retorted Peterkin; \"I'll have no title at all.  I shall merely  accept a highly responsible situation under government; for you see,  Jack, I'm fond of having an enormous salary and nothing to do.\"    \"But suppose there are no natives?\"    \"Then we'll build a charming villa, and plant a lovely garden round it,  stuck all full of the most splendiferous tropical flowers; and we'll  farm the land, plant, sow, reap, eat, sleep, and be merry.\"    \"But to be serious,\" said Jack, assuming a grave expression of  countenance--which, I observed, always had the effect of checking  Peterkin's disposition to make fun of everything--\"we are really in  rather an uncomfortable position.  If this is a desert island, we shall  have to live very much like the wild beasts; for we have not a tool of  any kind--not even a knife.\"    \"Yes, we have _that_,\" said Peterkin, fumbling in his trousers pocket,  from which he drew forth a small penknife with only one blade, and that  was broken.    \"Well, that's better than nothing.--But come,\" said Jack, rising; \"we  are wasting our time in _talking_ instead of _doing_.--You seem well  enough to walk now, Ralph.--Let us see what we have got in our pockets;  and then let us climb some hill and ascertain what sort of island we  have been cast upon, for, whether good or bad, it seems likely to be our  home for some time to come.\"        CHAPTER FOUR.    WE EXAMINE INTO OUR PERSONAL PROPERTY, AND MAKE A HAPPY DISCOVERY--OUR  ISLAND DESCRIBED--JACK PROVES HIMSELF TO BE LEARNED AND SAGACIOUS ABOVE  HIS FELLOWS--CURIOUS DISCOVERIES--NATURAL LEMONADE!    We now seated ourselves upon a rock, and began to examine into our  personal property.  When we reached the shore after being wrecked, my  companions had taken off part of their clothes and spread them out in  the sun to dry; for although the gale was raging fiercely, there was not  a single cloud in the bright sky.  They had also stripped off most part  of my wet clothes and spread them also on the rocks.  Having resumed our  garments, we now searched all our pockets with the utmost care, and laid  their contents out on a flat stone before us; and now that our minds  were fully alive to our condition, it was with no little anxiety that we  turned our several pockets inside out in order that nothing might escape  us.  When all was collected together, we found that our worldly goods  consisted of the following articles:    First, a small penknife with a single blade, broken off about the middle  and very rusty, besides having two or three notches on its edge.  (Peterkin said of this, with his usual pleasantry, that it would do for  a saw as well as a knife, which was a great advantage.)  Second, an old  German-silver pencil-case without any lead in it.  Third, a piece of  whip-cord about six yards long.  Fourth, a sailmaker's needle of a small  size.  Fifth, a ship's telescope, which I happened to have in my hand at  the time the ship struck, and which I had clung to firmly all the time I  was in the water; indeed, it was with difficulty that Jack got it out of  my grasp when I was lying insensible on the shore.  I cannot understand  why I kept such a firm hold of this telescope.  They say that a drowning  man will clutch at a straw.  Perhaps it may have been some such feeling  in me, for I did not know that it was in my hand at the time we were  wrecked.  However, we felt some pleasure in having it with us now--  although we did not see that it could be of much use to us, as the glass  at the small end was broken to pieces.  Our sixth article was a brass  ring which Jack always wore on his little finger.  I never understood  why he wore it; for Jack was not vain of his appearance, and did not  seem to care for ornaments of any kind.  Peterkin said, \"it was in  memory of the girl he left behind him!\"  But as he never spoke of this  girl to either of us, I am inclined to think that Peterkin was either  jesting or mistaken.  In addition to these articles, we had a little bit  of tinder and the clothes on our backs.  These last were as follows:    Each of us had on a pair of stout canvas trousers and a pair of sailors'  thick shoes.  Jack wore a red flannel shirt, a blue jacket, and a red  Kilmarnock bonnet or nightcap, besides a pair of worsted socks, and a  cotton pocket-handkerchief with sixteen portraits of Lord Nelson printed  on it and a union-jack in the middle.  Peterkin had on a striped flannel  shirt--which he wore outside his trousers and belted round his waist,  after the manner of a tunic--and a round black straw hat.  He had no  jacket, having thrown it off just before we were cast into the sea; but  this was not of much consequence, as the climate of the island proved to  be extremely mild--so much so, indeed, that Jack and I often preferred  to go about without our jackets.  Peterkin had also a pair of white  cotton socks and a blue handkerchief with white spots all over it.  My  own costume consisted of a blue flannel shirt, a blue jacket, a black  cap, and a pair of worsted socks, besides the shoes and canvas trousers  already mentioned.  This was all we had, and besides these things we had  nothing else; but when we thought of the danger from which we had  escaped, and how much worse off we might have been had the ship struck  on the reef during the night, we felt very thankful that we were  possessed of so much, although, I must confess, we sometimes wished that  we had had a little more.    While we were examining these things and talking about them, Jack  suddenly started and exclaimed:    \"The oar!  We have forgotten the oar!\"    \"What good will that do us?\" said Peterkin.  \"There's wood enough on the  island to make a thousand oars.\"    \"Ay, lad,\" replied Jack; \"but there's a bit of hoop-iron at the end of  it, and that may be of much use to us.\"    \"Very true,\" said I; \"let us go fetch it.\"  And with that we all three  rose and hastened down to the beach.  I still felt a little weak from  loss of blood, so that my companions soon began to leave me behind; but  Jack perceived this, and, with his usual considerate good-nature, turned  back to help me.  This was now the first time that I had looked well  about me since landing, as the spot where I had been laid was covered  with thick bushes, which almost hid the country from"]]]
