Beyond the downs was a plain, going down to a river of great  size, on the farther side of which there were other high mountains, with  the winter's snow still not quite melted; up the river, which ran winding  in many streams over a bed some two miles broad, I looked upon the second  great chain, and could see a narrow gorge where the river retired and was  lost.  I knew that there was a range still farther back; but except from  one place near the very top of my own mountain, no part of it was  visible: from this point, however, I saw, whenever there were no clouds,  a single snow-clad peak, many miles away, and I should think about as  high as any mountain in the world.  Never shall I forget the utter  loneliness of the prospect--only the little far-away homestead giving  sign of human handiwork;--the vastness of mountain and plain, of river  and sky; the marvellous atmospheric effects--sometimes black mountains  against a white sky, and then again, after cold weather, white mountains  against a black sky--sometimes seen through breaks and swirls of  cloud--and sometimes, which was best of all, I went up my mountain in a  fog, and then got above the mist; going higher and higher, I would look  down upon a sea of whiteness, through which would be thrust innumerable  mountain tops that looked like islands.    I am there now, as I write; I fancy that I can see the downs, the huts,  the plain, and the river-bed--that torrent pathway of desolation, with  its distant roar of waters.  Oh, wonderful! wonderful! so lonely and so  solemn, with the sad grey clouds above, and no sound save a lost lamb  bleating upon the mountain side, as though its little heart were  breaking.  Then there comes some lean and withered old ewe, with deep  gruff voice and unlovely aspect, trotting back from the seductive  pasture; now she examines this gully, and now that, and now she stands  listening with uplifted head, that she may hear the distant wailing and  obey it.  Aha! they see, and rush towards each other.  Alas! they are  both mistaken; the ewe is not the lamb's ewe, they are neither kin nor  kind to one another, and part in coldness.  Each must cry louder, and  wander farther yet; may luck be with them both that they may find their  own at nightfall.  But this is mere dreaming, and I must proceed.    I could not help speculating upon what might lie farther up the river and  behind the second range.  I had no money, but if I could only find  workable country, I might stock it with borrowed capital, and consider  myself a made man.  True, the range looked so vast, that there seemed  little chance of getting a sufficient road through it or over it; but no  one had yet explored it, and it is wonderful how one finds that one can  make a path into all sorts of places (and even get a road for  pack-horses), which from a distance appear inaccessible; the river was so  great that it must drain an inner tract--at least I thought so; and  though every one said it would be madness to attempt taking sheep farther  inland, I knew that only three years ago the same cry had been raised  against the country which my master's flock was now overrunning.  I could  not keep these thoughts out of my head as I would rest myself upon the  mountain side; they haunted me as I went my daily rounds, and grew upon  me from hour to hour, till I resolved that after shearing I would remain  in doubt no longer, but saddle my horse, take as much provision with me  as I could, and go and see for myself.    But over and above these thoughts came that of the great range itself.  What was beyond it?  Ah! who could say?  There was no one in the whole  world who had the smallest idea, save those who were themselves on the  other side of it--if, indeed, there was any one at all.  Could I hope to  cross it?  This would be the highest triumph that I could wish for; but  it was too much to think of yet.  I would try the nearer range, and see  how far I could go.  Even if I did not find country, might I not find  gold, or diamonds, or copper, or silver?  I would sometimes lie flat down  to drink out of a stream, and could see little yellow specks among the  sand; were these gold?  People said no; but then people always said there  was no gold until it was found to be abundant: there was plenty of slate  and granite, which I had always understood to accompany gold; and even  though it was not found in paying quantities here, it might be abundant  in the main ranges.  These thoughts filled my head, and I could not  banish them.          CHAPTER II: IN THE WOOL-SHED      At last shearing came; and with the shearers there was an old native,  whom they had nicknamed Chowbok--though, I believe, his real name was  Kahabuka.  He was a sort of chief of the natives, could speak a little  English, and was a great favourite with the missionaries.  He did not do  any regular work with the shearers, but pretended to help in the yards,  his real aim being to get the grog, which is always more freely  circulated at shearing-time: he did not get much, for he was apt to be  dangerous when drunk; and very little would make him so: still he did get  it occasionally, and if one wanted to get anything out of him, it was the  best bribe to offer him.  I resolved to question him, and get as much  information from him as I could.  I did so.  As long as I kept to  questions about the nearer ranges, he was easy to get on with--he had  never been there, but there were traditions among his tribe to the effect  that there was no sheep-country, nothing, in fact, but stunted timber and  a few river-bed flats.  It was very difficult to reach; still there were  passes: one of them up our own river, though not directly along the river-  bed, the gorge of which was not practicable; he had never seen any one  who had been there: was there not enough on this side?  But when I  came to the main range, his manner changed at once.  He became uneasy,  and began to prevaricate and shuffle.  In a very few minutes I could see  that of this too there existed traditions in his tribe; but no efforts or  coaxing could get a word from him about them.  At last I hinted about  grog, and presently he feigned consent: I gave it him; but as soon as he  had drunk it he began shamming intoxication, and then went to sleep, or  pretended to do so, letting me kick him pretty hard and never budging.    I was angry, for I had to go without my own grog and had got nothing out  of him; so the next day I determined that he should tell me before I gave  him any, or get none at all.    Accordingly, when night came and the shearers had knocked off work and  had their supper, I got my share of rum in a tin pannikin and made a sign  to Chowbok to follow me to the wool-shed, which he willingly did,  slipping out after me, and no one taking any notice of either of us.  When  we got down to the wool-shed we lit a tallow candle, and having stuck it  in an old bottle we sat down upon the wool bales and began to smoke.  A  wool-shed is a roomy place, built somewhat on the same plan as a  cathedral, with aisles on either side full of pens for the sheep, a great  nave, at the upper end of which the shearers work, and a further space  for wool sorters and packers.  It always refreshed me with a semblance of  antiquity (precious in a new country), though I very well knew that the  oldest wool-shed in the settlement was not more than seven years old,  while this was only two.  Chowbok pretended to expect his grog at once,  though we both of us knew very well what the other was after, and that we  were each playing against the other, the one for grog the other for  information.    We had a hard fight: for more than two hours he had tried to put me off  with lies but had carried no conviction; during the whole time we had  been morally wrestling with one another and had neither of us apparently  gained the least advantage; at length, however, I had become sure that he  would give in ultimately, and that with a little further patience I  should get his story out of him.  As upon a cold day in winter, when one  has churned (as I had often had to do), and churned in vain, and the  butter makes no sign of coming, at last one tells by the sound that the  cream has gone to sleep, and then upon a sudden the butter comes, so I  had churned at Chowbok until I perceived that he had arrived, as it were,  at the sleepy stage, and that with a continuance of steady quiet pressure  the day was mine.  On a sudden, without a word of warning, he rolled two  bales of wool (his strength was very great) into the middle of the floor,  and on the top of these he placed another crosswise; he snatched up an  empty wool-pack, threw it like a mantle over his shoulders, jumped upon  the uppermost bale, and sat upon it.  In a moment his whole form was  changed.  His high shoulders dropped; he set his feet close together,  heel to heel and toe to toe; he laid his arms and hands close alongside  of his body, the palms following his thighs; he held his head high but  quite straight, and his eyes stared right in front of him; but he frowned  horribly, and assumed an expression of face that was positively fiendish.  At the best of times Chowbok was very ugly, but he now exceeded all  conceivable limits of the hideous.  His mouth extended almost from ear to  ear, grinning horribly and showing all his teeth; his eyes glared, though  they remained quite fixed, and his forehead was contracted with a most  malevolent scowl.    I am afraid my description will have conveyed only the ridiculous side of  his appearance; but the ridiculous and the sublime are near, and the  grotesque fiendishness of Chowbok's"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19061"],[0,"Seeing Europe with Famous Authors, Volume 8 (#3)"],[1,"are requisite to define their  differences. I note, simply, the inclination of the Tower. Some suppose  that, when half constructed, the tower sank in the earth on one side,  and that the architects continued on; seeing that they did continue  this deflection was only a partial obstacle to them. In any event, there  are other leaning towers in Italy, at Bologna, for example; voluntarily  or involuntarily this feeling for oddness, this love of paradox, this  yielding to fancy is one of the characteristics of the Middle Ages.    In the center of the Baptistery stands a superb font with eight panels;  each panel is incrusted with a rich complicated flower in full bloom,  and each flower is different. Around it a circle of large Corinthian  columns supports round-arch arcades; most of them are antique and are  ornamented with antique bas-reliefs; Meleager with his barking dogs, and  the nude torsos of his companions in attendance on Christian mysteries.  On the left stands a pulpit similar to that of Sienna, the first work of  Nicholas of Pisa (1260), a simple marble coffer supported by marble  columns and covered with sculptures. The sentiment of force and of  antique nudity comes out here in striking features. The sculptor  comprehended the postures and torsions of bodies. His figures, somewhat  massive, are grand and simple; he frequently reproduces the tunics and  folds of the Roman costume; one of his nude personages, a sort of  Hercules bearing a young lion on his shoulders, has the broad breast and  muscular tension which the sculptors of the sixteenth century admired.    The last of these edifices, the Campo-Santo, is a cemetery, the soil of  which, brought from Palestine, is holy ground. Four high walls of  polished marble surround it with their white and crowded panels.  Inside, a square gallery forms a promenade opening into the court  through arcades trellised with ogive windows. It is filled with funereal  monuments, busts, inscriptions and statues of every form and of every  age. Nothing could be simpler and nobler. A framework of dark wood  supports the arch overhead, and the crest of the roof cuts sharp against  the crystal sky. At the angles are four rustling cypress trees,  tranquilly swayed by the breeze. Grass is growing in the court with a  wild freshness and luxuriance. Here and there a climbing flower twined  around a column, a small rosebush, or a shrub glows beneath a gleam of  sunshine. There is no noise; this quarter is deserted; only now and then  is heard the voice of some promenader which reverberates as under the  vault of a church. It is the veritable cemetery of a free and Christian  city; here, before the tombs of the great, people might well reflect  over death and public affairs.          THE WALLS AND \"SKYSCRAPERS\" OF PISA[5]    BY JANET ROSS AND NELLY ERICHSON      Few cities have preserved their medieval walls with such loving care as  Pisa. The circuit is complete save where the traveler enters the city;  and there, alas, a wide breach has been made by the restless spirit of  modernity. But once past the paltry barrier and the banal square, with  its inevitable statue of Victor Emanuel, that take the place of the old  Porta Romana, one quickly perceives that the city is a walled one.  Glimpses of battlements close the vistas of the streets, and green  fields peep through the open gates, marking that abrupt transition  between town and country peculiar to a fortified city.    The walls are best seen from without. An admirable impression of them  can be had on leaving the city by the Porta Lucchese. Turning to the  left, after passing a crucifix overshadowed by cypresses, we come to the  edge of a stretch of level marshy meadows, gaily pied in spring with  orchids and grape hyacinths. Above our heads the high air vibrates with  the song of larks. Before us is the long line of the city walls. Strong,  grim and gray, they look with nothing to break the outline of square  battlements against the sky, but that majestic groups of domes and  towers for whose defense they were built. At the angle of the wall to  the right is a square watch-tower, backed by groups of cypresses that  rise into the air like dark flames. Its little windows command the flat  plain as far as the horizon. How easy to imagine the warning blast of  the warder's trumpet as he caught sight of a distant enemy, and the wall  springing into life at the sound. Armed men buckling on their harness  would swarm up ladders to the battlements, the catapult groan and squeak  as its lever was forced backward, and at the sharp word of command the  first flight of arrows would be loosed.    But the dream fades, and we pass on to the angle of the wall where the  cypresses stand. From the picturesque Jews' cemetery, to which access is  easy, the structure of the walls can be studied in detail because the  hand of the restorer has been perforce withheld within its gates. The  wall is some forty feet high, built of stone from the Pisan hills,  weathered for the most part to a grayish hue. The masonry of the lower  half is good. The blocks of stone are large and well laid. Those of the  upper half are smaller and the masonry is in places careless and  irregular. The red brick battlements are square. At short intervals  there are walled-up gateways, round-headed or ogival in form, and the  whole surface is rent and patched. Centuries of war and earthquakes,  rain and fire, have given it a pleasant irregularity, the record of  violent and troublous times.    The city can be reentered by the Porta Nuova, only a few yards to the  left of the cemetery. So venerable do these battered walls look that we  need the full evidence of history to realize that they had more than one  predecessor. The memory even of the first walls of Pisa, an ancient city  when Rome was young, has been lost. The earliest record of which we know  anything appears on a map of the ninth century drawn by one Bonanno; a  map, we should rather say professing to be of the ninth century, for  churches of the thirteenth century are marked upon it, so it must either  have been made, or the churches inserted, then....    The ancient walls were practically swept away by the prosperity of Pisa.  Beside the Balearic Islands she had conquered Carthage, the Lipari  Islands, Elba, Corsica, and Palermo, and her galleys poured their spoils  into the Pisan port. She traded with the East, and was successful in  commerce as in war. Her inhabitants increased rapidly. They could no  longer be penned within the narrow limits of the old wall, but  overflowed in all directions beyond it. Not only was the Borgo thickly  populated, but a whole new region called Forisportae, sprang up.    So masked was the wall by houses, built into it and huddling against it  both on the outside and the inside, that it seems to have been actually  invisible. So much so that contemporary chroniclers spoke of Pisa as  without walls, and attributed her safety to the valor of her citizens  and the multitude of her towers. The ancient wall was evidently so  hidden and decayed that Pisa must be regarded as a defenseless city in  the twelfth century. It is curious that her citizens should have  neglected their own safety at a time when they were masters of  fortification and defense; when their fame in these arts had reached as  far as Egypt and Syria, and when the Milanese came to them to beg for  engineers....    The external appearance of an Italian city in the twelfth century was so  unlike anything we are accustomed to in modern times that a strong  effort of the imagination is needed to conceive it. Seen from a distance  the walls enclosed, not houses, but a forest of tall square shafts,  rising into the sky like the crowded chimney stacks in a manufacturing  town but far more thickly set together. The city appeared, to use a  graphic contemporary metaphor, like a sheaf of corn bound together by  its walls.    [Illustration: PANEL IN THE CATHEDRAL, SHOWING PART OF THE MEDIEVAL WALL  AND TOWERS OF PISA]    San Gimignano, tho most of its towers have perished long ago, helps us  to imagine faintly what Italian towns were like in the days of Frederick  Barbarossa or his grandson Frederick II. For most of the houses were  actually towers, long rectangular columns, vying with each other in  height and crowded close together on either side of the narrow, airless,  darkened streets. Sometimes they were connected with one another by  wooden bridges, and all were furnished with wooden balconies used in  defensive and offensive warfare with their neighbors.    Cities full of towers were common all over southern France and central  Italy, but Tuscany had more than any other state, and those of Pisa were  the most famous of all. The habit of building and dwelling in towers  rather than in houses may have arisen from the difficulty of expanding  laterally within an enclosed city; but a stronger reason may be found in  the dangers and uncertainty of life in a period when a man might be  attacked at any moment by his fellow-citizen, as well as by the enemy of  the state. It was a distinct military advantage to overlook one's  neighbor, who might be an enemy; and towers rose higher and higher. The  spirit of emulation entered, and rich nobles gloried in adding tower to  tower and in looking down on all rivals.    But whatever the cause of their existence, they were picturesque, and  must have presented a gallant sight on the eve of a high festival. The  tall shafts were tinged with gold by the western sun, their battlements  crowned with three fluttering banners--the eagle of the Emperor, the  white cross of the Commune, and the device of the People--looking as tho  a cloud of many-colored butterflies were hovering over the city.    Again, how dramatic the scene when the city was rent by one of the  perpetually recurring faction-fights. Light bridges with grappling-irons  were thrown from tower to tower, doors and "]]]
