I want to go to,\"--she drew a long breath, and glanced at  her mother, as if bracing herself to meet opposition--\"to Hurst Manor!  There!  I've read about it in magazines, and Ella Mason had a cousin who  had been there, and she said it was--simply mag.!  She was Head Girl,  and ruled the house, and came out first in the games, and she said she  never had such sport in her life, and found the holidays quite fearfully  flat and stale in comparison.\"    \"You don't become Head Girl all at once,\" interposed Harold, drily;  while Mrs Chester gave another sob at the idea that home could ever be  looked upon in so sad a light.    \"Hurst Manor?\" she repeated vaguely.  \"That's a strange name.  I never  heard of the place before.  What do you know about it that makes you  want to go, darling?  Are you quite sure it is nice, and what is the  Head Mistress like, and how many young la-- girls does she take?  Not  too many, I hope, for I can't see how they can be properly looked after  when there are more than twenty or thirty.  I've heard terrible stories  of delicacy for life arising from neglect.  You remember poor, dear Evie  Vane!  Her glands swelled, and nobody noticed, and--\"    \"My glands never swell.  They know better.  Over two hundred girls,  mother; but they are divided into different houses, with a staff of  teachers in charge of each, so there's no fear of being neglected; and  it's much more fun living in a crowd.  I'm tired of talking to the same  people over and over again, and should love a variety.  Among the  hundred girls, one would be sure to find one or two whom one could  really like.\"    Harold laughed again, a sleepy laugh, which brought a flash into his  sister's eyes.  That was the worst of Harold; he was so superior!  He  never argued, nor contradicted, but he had a way of smiling to himself,  of throwing back his head and half shutting his eyes, which made Rhoda  feel as if throwing cushions at him would be the only adequate relief to  her feelings.  She glared at him for a moment, and then turned her back  on him in a marked manner and addressed herself to her father.    \"You will write to Miss Bruce at once, won't you, father, and arrange  for me to go at the beginning of the term?\"    \"I will write for particulars, or, better still, your mother and I will  go down to see the place for ourselves.  I should like you to go to the  school you fancy, if it can be arranged, and I suppose this is as good  as any.\"    \"Better!\"  Rhoda declared rapturously, \"a thousand times better!  Ella  Mason said so; and she knows, because her cousin's sisters have all been  at different schools--one at Cheltenham, one at Saint Andrew's, one at  Wycombe, and she declares that Hurst beats them all.  It must be so,  since it has adopted all the good ideas and abandoned the bad.\"  She  went on with a rambling statement which seemed to imply that Miss Bruce  had been in turn sole proprietor of each of these well-known schools  before abandoning them in favour of her new establishment; that Hurst  Manor buildings had been recently erected, at vast expense, to provide  every possible convenience for the pupils, and at the same time was a  nobleman's seat of venerable interest; that sports and games formed the  chief interest of the pupils, lessons being relegated to an appropriate  secondary position; while, astonishing to relate, the honours in all  University examinations fell to \"Hurst girls,\" and every woman who had  made a name for herself had graduated from its ranks!  She detailed  these interesting items of information with sublime assurance; and, when  Harold mildly pointed out inconsistencies, retorted scornfully that she  supposed she might be allowed to know, since Ella's cousin had _said_  so, and she had been there, and seen for herself!  Mrs Chester  supported her by murmurs of assent, and little warning frowns to her  son, which in dumb language signified that he was to be a good boy, and  not aggravate his sister; and Mr Chester put his arm round her waist,  and looked down at her, half smiling, half pitiful.  The pitiful  expression grew, and became so marked that the girl gazed at him in  surprise.  Why did he look so sorry?  Was he already feeling the blank  which her absence would leave?  Did he fear that she would be home-sick,  and regret her hasty decision?  She stared into his face with her bright  blue eyes, and her father gazed back, noting the firm chin, the arched  brows, the characteristic tilt of the head.  This overweening confidence  of youth--he was asking himself earnestly--was it altogether a  misfortune, or but raw material out of which great things were to be  made in the future?  Was it not better to go forth to meet life's battle  with a light heart and fearless tread than trembling and full of doubt?  Surely it was better, and yet his heart was sore for the girl, as the  heart of a leader must be sore when he sends his soldiers to the front,  knowing that no victory is won without a cost, no fight without a scar.  Something very like a tear glittered in the father's eye, and at the  sight Rhoda's face softened into a charming tenderness.  She snuggled  her head into his neck, and rubbed her soft cheeks against his,  murmuring absurd little sentences of endearment, as to a child of two  years old.    \"Whose pet is it, then?  Whose own precious?  The nicest old sweet in  the world.\"    Mr Chester pushed the girl aside, and put on a frown of portentous  ferocity to conceal the delight with which her demonstration had, in  reality, filled him.  He loved to feel the sweep of the crisp locks, the  touch of the soft cheek; he even appreciated, if the truth must be told,  being addressed as a \"precious,\" but wild horses would not have induced  him to confess as much, and he made haste to leave the room with Harold  lest perchance any sign of his real feelings might betray themselves to  the sharp feminine eye.    Left alone with her mother, Rhoda clasped her hands behind her back, and  paced slowly up and down.  It was a relief, after all, to be rid of the  men, and be able to talk things over with a feminine hearer who never  brought forward inconvenient quibbles, who accepted statements as facts,  as of course they were, and agreed to propositions in a quiet,  reasonable manner.  Rhoda thought out several important matters in that  march to and fro, and announced the result in a decisive manner.    \"I must have a complete new outfit!  I don't believe in taking half-worn  things.  You can send them away to that poor clergyman in Ireland, with  the five daughters.  Geraldine, isn't it, who `fits' my clothes?  Well,  Geraldine shall have my blue silk, and the fawn jacket, and the blouses,  and the grey dress.  If the arm-holes stick into her as much as they do  into me, she will wish I had never been invented.  She can have my best  hat, too, if she wants it.  I hate it, and at `Hurst' you never wear  anything but sailors', with the school colours.  There is a blue house,  and a pink, and a green, and a yellow, and a red; that's the way they  arrange in all big schools, and I only hope and pray it won't be my fate  to be yellow, or _what_ an image I'll look!  Other things being equal,  Mum dear, kindly say you think the blue house would be best for my  health and morals.  I want to live _in_, you understand, not _out_--  that's one point I have quite decided.\"    \"In what, dearest?  Out of what?  I don't understand what you mean.\"    \"In school itself.  There are three houses in the school building and  three in the grounds, and, of course, if you live `out' you have ten  minutes' walk over to classes, whatever the weather may be.  I should  object to shivering across the first thing in the morning in rain and  snow and getting all splashed and blown.  No one can call me a coddle,  but I _do_ like comfort, and it would be a dreadful fag--\"    \"I should think so, indeed; most risky!  I wouldn't hear of it for you.  If you go at all you must live in, and have a comfortable room, with a  fire in cold weather.\"    \"Oh, well; I don't know if you can expect that.  We mustn't be too  exacting.  You will look after my clothes at once, mother, won't you?  for there will be so much to get.  I want things nice, you know!  I  should like the girls to see that I had decent belongings.  I love  having all the _little_ things complete and dainty.  I think girls ought  to be particular about them.  It's a sign of refinement.  I can't endure  shabby things round me.\"    \"Of course not, darling; and there's no reason why you should.  Write  down a list of what you want, so that we shan't forget anything when we  are in town.  You shall have all you need; but, oh! dear me, I don't  know how shall I live when you have gone.  I shall break my heart  without you!\"  And Mrs Chester's tears once more rolled down her  cheeks.  It seemed to her at this moment that the greatest trouble which  her happy life had known was this projected parting from her beloved  daughter.        CHAPTER THREE.    ANTICIPATIONS.    Two days later Mr and Mrs Chester started on their tour of inspection,  and Rhoda reflected that she could not employ herself better during  their absence than by preparing, so far as might be, for the life ahead.  She went upstairs to her own sitting-room, and made a sweeping survey  of her treasures.  The books in the hanging cases must, of course, be  left behind, since they were too numerous to carry.  She looked lovingly  at their bright gold and leather backs, and took down a special  favourite here and there, to dip into its contents.  The Waverley novels  ran in a long, yellow line across one shelf; Dickens, clad in red, came  immediately beneath; and a whole row of poets on the bottom shelf.  Wordsworth was a prize"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21111"],[0,"Wild Nature Won By Kindness (#3)"],[1,"to get out. A  little crowd would gather round and stare at such a self-possessed small  bird. I was asked \"if it was a very rare bird?\" It seemed almost absurd  to have to reply, \"No, only a common starling;\" but people are so  accustomed to see a caged pet flutter in terror at its unusual  surroundings, that my kingly Richard rather puzzled his admirers.    When we began life in our apartments, one important consideration in the  day's proceedings was the starling's food. There was no home larder to  fall back upon, so a daily portion of tender rump-steak had to be  obtained, to the great amusement of the butcher with whom we dealt for  our own joints.    About this time the plain grey plumage began to be varied by two patches  of brilliant little purple feathers, tipped with greyish-white, which  appeared on each side of his breast. Some began to peep out of his back  and head. He moulted his tail, and had rich, dark feathers all over, in  time, till he arrived at being what he was often called, \"a perfect  beauty\"--glossy and brilliant, bronze gold and purple, with reflets of  rich green, and little specks of greyish-white all over his breast; this  richness of colour, combined with his beautiful sleek shape, made  Richard a very attractive bird.    When we returned from Buxton, I was so confident of the bird's tameness  I used to carry him in my hand out to the tulip tree, and there I often  sat and read, while Richard would pry into the moss and the bark of the  tree, searching for insects, and though he could fly well by this time,  he did not try to do so, but seemed content to keep near me.    One morning I heard his first articulate word, \"Beauty,\" spoken so  clearly it quite startled me. I had been diligently teaching him, by  constant repetition, for many weeks, and by degrees he gained the power  of speaking one word after another, till at last he was able to say,  \"Little beauty,\" \"'Ow de doo?\" \"Pretty, pretty,\" \"Beauty, dear,\" \"Puss,  puss,\" \"Miaow,\" and imitated kissing exactly. All this was intermingled  with his native whistle and sundry inarticulate sounds, intended, I  suppose, to result in words and sentences some day. Whilst talking and  singing, his head was held very upright, and his wings flapped  incessantly against his sides, after the manner of the wild birds.    Nothing stirred my indignation more keenly than the question so often  asked, \"Have you had your starling's tongue slit to make him talk so  well?\" I beg emphatically to entreat all my readers to do their utmost  to put an end to this cruel and perfectly useless custom. My bird's  talking powers were remarkable, but they were the result of his  intelligence being drawn out and cultivated by constant, loving care,  attention to his little wants, and being talked to and played with, and  made into a little feathered friend of the family.    Now must be told an episode which cost me no little heartache. Richard  was out in my room one morning as usual, when the room door happening to  be open, away he flew into the next room, and out at an open window into  the garden. I saw him alight on a tree, but by the time I could reach  the garden he had gone. I saw a group of starlings in a beech tree near  by, and another set were chattering on the house roof, but there was no  telling if my Richard was one of them. I called till I was tired, and  continued to do so at intervals all day, but no wanderer appeared. His  cage had been put on the lawn, but to no purpose. I feared I should  never see my pet again, because I supposed he might be lured by the wild  birds till he got out of hearing of any familiar voice. I confess it was  hard to think of my bright young birdie starving under some hedge, for I  felt sure he was too much of a gentleman from his artificial bringing-up  to be able to earn his own living. All I could do was to resolve to be  up very early next day, and call again and again, on the chance of his  being within hearing. Before six o'clock next morning I was seeking the  truant. Plenty of wild birds were about, the bright sun glancing on  their sleek coats--all looking so like my pet it was impossible to  distinguish him. I little knew that he was then starving and miserable  under a bush in the upper part of the garden. I continued calling and  seeking him until breakfast-time, and fast losing all hope of ever  seeing him again. About eleven o'clock I was returning from the kitchen  garden, with my hands full of fruit and flowers, when, to my intense  delight, poor little Richard came slowly out from under a laurel, and  stood in the path before me, as veritable a type of a birdish prodigal  son as could well be imagined.    His feathers were ruffled, his wings drooping, his whole aspect  irresistibly reminded one of the Jackdaw of Rheims; and the way he  sidled up to me, with half-closed eyes and drooping head, was one of the  most pathetic things I ever experienced. He so plainly said, \"I'm very  sorry--hope you'll forgive me; won't do it again\"; and certainly his  mute appeal was not in vain, for down went my fruit and flowers, and  with loving words I took up my lost darling, and cooed over him all  sorts of affectionate rubbish until we reached home and he was restored  to his cage. There his one desire was water. Poor fellow! he was nearly  famished. I think another hour would have seen his end. There is no  water in the garden, except in the stone vase in front of the  dining-room window, and he would not have known how to find that, so he  must have been twenty-eight hours without drinking anything beyond a  possible drop of dew now and then. I had to feed him with great care--a  little food, and very often, until he recovered a measure of strength.  He was very drooping all day, and I quite feared he might not live after  all, he was so nearly starved to death. After some days, however,  \"Richard was himself again,\" and as bright and amusing as ever. I have  not related the amusing characteristics of his \"daily tub.\" His love of  water was a perfect passion, and water he would have. At first he was  treated to a large glass dish on the matting in the dining-room, but he  sent up such a perfect fountain of spray over curtains, couch, and  chairs, that the housemaid voted \"that bird\" a nuisance, and a better  plan was devised. In the conservatory is a pool of water, with rock-work  and ferns at the back, and there is a central tube where a fountain can  be turned on. I made a small island of green moss a little above the  water, and, placing Richard upon it, I turned the fountain on to play a  delicate shower of spray over him. He was perfectly enchanted, and  fluttered, turned about, and frisked, like a bird possessed. As he  became accustomed to it, I began to throw handfuls of water over him,  and that he did enjoy. He would cower down, and lie with his wings  expanded and beak open, receiving charge after charge of water till  quite out of breath; then he would run a few paces away on his island  till he recovered himself, and then would go back and place himself  ready for a renewed douche. I never saw such a plucky bird. If I had  been trying to drown him I could not have done more, for sometimes he  was knocked backwards into the pool; but no matter, he was up again, and  all ready in a minute. He generally tired me out, and when I turned off  the fountain, he would either fly or run after me into the drawing-room  and go into his cage, which always stood there; and there followed a  very careful toilette--a general oiling and pluming and fluttering,  until his bonnie little feathers were all in good order; and then would  follow endless chatter, and he would inform the world that he was a  \"little beauty,\" \"pretty little dear,\" &c.    Starlings seem to have an abundant supply of natural oil in the gland  where it is stored, for his feathers were never really much wetted by  his tremendous baths, and he was a slippery fellow to hold, his plumage  was so glossy and sleek.    A word must be said about his temper; it was decidedly not meek by any  means, and his will was strong, so the least thing would bring a shower  of pecks in token of disapproval, and if scolded his attitude was most  absurd; he would draw himself up to a wonderful height, set up his crest  feathers, and stand ready to meet all comers, like a little fighting  cock; and when a finger was pointed at him he would scold and peck, and  flap with his wings with the utmost fury; and yet if a kind word was  said all his wrath vanished, and he would come on your hand and prize  your fingers apart, looking for grubs as usual. It seemed strange that  his habit of thus searching for insects everywhere should continue,  though he was never by any chance rewarded by finding one. A starling's  range of ideas may be summed up in the word \"Grubs.\" It was always  immensely amusing to strangers to see Richard, when out in the room,  searching with his inquisitive beak in the most hopeless places with a  cheerful happy activity, as if he always felt sure that long-looked-for  grub, for which he had searched all the years of his life, must be close  by, round the corners somewhere, under the penwiper, behind that book,  amongst these coloured silks; and if interfered with he would give a  peck and a chirp, as much as to say, \"Do let me alone, I'm busy; I've  got my living to get, and grubs seem scarce.\" Richard was the only bird  I have ever had who learnt the nature of windows, he never flew against  them; he had one or two severe concussions, and being a very sensible  bird he \"concluded\" he wouldn't do it again; he would fly backwards and  forwards in the drawing-room in swift flight, but I never feared either  the windows or the fire, as he avoided both.    Several times Master Richard was found flying about in the drawing-room,  and yet no one had let him out; we could only suppose that by some  mischance the door must have been left open; yet"]]]
