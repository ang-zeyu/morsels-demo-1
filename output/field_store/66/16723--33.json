She watched him catch a fish. Then she watched him run about to dry off  and keep from getting cold, and her eyes twinkled.    \"'He who helps himself deserves to be helped,' said Old Mother Nature.  Mr. Mink didn't know what she meant by that, but the next morning he  found out. Yes, Sir, the next morning he found out. He found that he  had a brand new coat over his old one, and the new one was waterproof.  He could swim as much as he pleased and not get the least bit wet,  because the water couldn't get through that new coat. And ever since  that long-ago day when the world was young, the Minks have had  waterproof coats and have been famous fishermen. Hello, Peter Rabbit!  What under the sun are you trying to do, swelling yourself up that way?\"    \"I--I was just practising holding my breath,\" replied Peter and looked  very, very foolish.    \"Ho, ho, ho! Ha, ha, ha!\" laughed Grandfather Frog. \"You can't learn to  swim by holding your breath on dry land, Peter Rabbit.\"                                          III                       HOW OLD MR. TOAD LEARNED TO SING                                          III                       HOW OLD MR. TOAD LEARNED TO SING      Peter Rabbit never will forget how he laughed the first time he heard  Old Mr. Toad say that he could sing and was going to sing. Why, Peter  would as soon think of singing himself, and that is something he can no  more do than he can fly. Peter had known Old Mr. Toad ever since he  could remember. He was rather fond of him, even if he did play jokes on  him once in a while. But he always thought of Old Mr. Toad as one of the  homeliest of all his friends,--slow, awkward, and too commonplace to be  very interesting. So when, in the glad joyousness of the spring, Old  Mr. Toad had told Jimmy Skunk that he was going down to the Smiling Pool  to sing because without him the great chorus there would lack one of its  sweetest voices, Peter and Jimmy had laughed till the tears came.    A few days later Peter happened over to the Smiling Pool for a call on  Grandfather Frog. A mighty chorus of joy from unseen singers rose from  all about the Smiling Pool. Peter knew about those singers. They were  Hylas, the little cousins of Sticky-toes the Tree Toad. Peter sat very  still on the edge of the bank trying to see one of them. Suddenly he  became aware of a new note, one he never had noticed before and sweeter  than any of the others. Indeed it was one of the sweetest of all the  spring songs, as sweet as the love notes of Tommy Tit the Chickadee,  than which there is none sweeter.    It seemed to come from the shallow water just in front of Peter, and he  looked eagerly for the singer. Then his eyes opened until it seemed as  if they would pop right out of his head, and he dropped his lower jaw  foolishly. There was Old Mr. Toad with a queer bag Peter never had seen  before swelled out under his chin, and as surely as Peter was sitting on  that bank, it was Old Mr. Toad who was the sweet singer!    Old Mr. Toad paid no attention to Peter, not even when he was spoken to.  He was so absorbed in his singing that he just didn't hear. Peter sat  there a while to listen; then he called Jimmy Skunk and Unc' Billy  Possum, who were also listening to the music, and they were just as  surprised as Peter. Then he spied Jerry Muskrat at the other end of the  Smiling Pool and hurried over there. Peter was so full of the discovery  he had made that he could think of nothing else. He fairly ached to  tell.    \"Jerry!\" he cried. \"Oh, Jerry Muskrat! Do you know that Old Mr. Toad can  sing?\"    Jerry looked surprised that Peter should ask such a question. \"Of course  I know it,\" said he. \"It would be mighty funny if I didn't know it,  seeing that he is the sweetest singer in the Smiling Pool and has sung  here every spring since I can remember.\"    Peter looked very much chagrined. \"I didn't know it until just how,\" he  confessed. \"I didn't believe him when he told me that he could sing. I  wonder how he ever learned.\"    \"He didn't learn any more than you learned how to jump,\" replied Jerry.  \"It just came to him naturally. His father sang, and his grandfather,  and his great grandfather, way back to the beginning of things. I  thought everybody knew about that.\"    \"I don't. Tell me about it. Please do, Jerry,\" begged Peter.    \"All right, I will,\" replied Jerry good-naturedly. \"It's something  you ought to know about, anyway. In the first place, Old Mr. Toad  belongs to a very old and honorable family, one of the very oldest.  I've heard say that it goes way back almost to the very beginning of  things when there wasn't much land. Anyway, the first Toad, the  great-great-ever-so-great-grandfather of Old Mr. Toad and own cousin to  the great-great-ever-so-great-grandfather of Grandfather Frog, was one  of the first to leave the water for the dry land.    \"Old Mother Nature met him hopping along and making hard work of it  because, of course, it was so new. She looked at him sharply. 'What are  you doing here?' she demanded. 'Aren't you contented with the water  where you were born?'    \"Mr. Toad bowed very low. 'Yes'm,' said he very humbly. 'I'll go right  back there if you say so. I thought there must be some things worth  finding out on the land, and that I might be of some use in the Great  World.'    \"His answer pleased Old Mother Nature. She was worried. She had planted  all kinds of things on the land, and they were springing up everywhere,  but she had discovered that bugs of many kinds liked the tender green  things and were increasing so fast and were so greedy that they  threatened to strip the land of all that she had planted. She had so  many things to attend to that she hadn't time to take care of the bugs.  'If you truly want to be of some use,' said she, 'you can attend to some  of those bugs.'    \"Mr. Toad went right to work, and Old Mother Nature went about some  other business. Having so many other things to look after, she quite  forgot about Mr. Toad, and it was several weeks before she came that way  again. Right in the middle of a great bare place where the bugs had  eaten everything was a beautiful green spot, and patiently hopping from  plant to plant was Mr. Toad, snapping up every bug he could see. He  didn't see Old Mother Nature and kept right on working. She watched him  a while as he hopped from plant to plant catching bugs as fast as he  could, and then she spoke.    \"'Have you stayed right here ever since I last saw you?' she asked.    \"Mr. Toad gave a start of surprise. 'Yes'm,' said he.    \"'But I thought you wanted to see the Great World and learn things,'  said she.    \"Mr. Toad looked a little embarrassed. 'So I did,' he replied, 'but I  wanted to be of some use, and the bugs have kept me so busy there was no  time to travel. Besides, I have learned a great deal right here. I--I  couldn't get around fast enough to save _all_ the plants, but I have  saved what I could.'    \"Old Mother Nature was more pleased than she was willing to show, for  Mr. Toad was the first of all the little people who had tried to help  her, and he had done what he could willingly and faithfully.    \"'I suppose,' said she, speaking a little gruffly, 'you expect me to  reward you.'    \"Mr. Toad looked surprised and a little hurt. 'I don't want any reward,'  said he. 'I didn't do it for that. It will be reward enough to know that  I really have helped and to be allowed to continue to help.'    \"At that Old Mother Nature's face lighted with one of her most beautiful  smiles. 'Mr. Toad,' said she, 'if you could have just what you want,  what would it be?'    \"Mr. Toad hesitated a few minutes and then said shyly, 'A beautiful  voice.'    \"It was Old Mother Nature's turn to look surprised. 'A beautiful voice!'  she exclaimed. 'Pray, why do you want a beautiful voice?'    \"'So that I can express my happiness in the most beautiful way I know  of,--by singing,' replied Mr. Toad.    \"'You shall have it,' declared Old Mother Nature, 'but not all the time  lest you be tempted to forget your work, which, you know, is the real  source of true happiness. In the spring of each year you shall go back  to your home in the water, and there for a time you shall sing to your  heart's content, and there shall be no sweeter voice than yours.'    \"Sure enough, when the next spring came, Mr. Toad was filled with a  great longing to go home. When he got there, he found that in his throat  was a little music bag; and when he swelled it out, he had one of the  sweetest voices in the world. And so it has been ever since with the  Toad family. Old Mr. Toad is one of the sweetest singers in the Smiling  Pool, but when it is time to go back to work he never grumbles, but is  one of the most faithful workers in Mother Nature's garden,\" concluded  Jerry Muskrat.    Peter sighed. \"I never could work,\" said he. \"Perhaps that is why I  cannot sing.\"    \"Very likely,\" replied Jerry Muskrat, quite forgetting that he cannot  sing himself although he is a great worker.                                           IV                      HOW OLD MR. CROW LOST HIS DOUBLE TONGUE                                           IV                      HOW OLD MR. CROW LOST HIS DOUBLE TONGUE      \"Caw, caw, caw, caw!\" Blacky the Crow sat in the top of a tall tree and  seemed trying to see just how much noise he could make with that harsh  voice of his. Peter Rabbit peered out from the dear Old Briar-patch and  frowned.    \"If I had a voice as unpleasant as that, I'd forget I could talk. Yes,  Sir, I'd forget I had a tongue,\" declared Peter.    Somebody laughed, and Peter turned quickly to find Jimmy Skunk. \"What  are you laughing at?\" demanded Peter.    \"At the idea of you forgetting that you had a tongue,\" replied Jimmy.    \"Well, I would if I had a voice like Blacky's,\" persisted Peter,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/213"],[0,"The Man from Snowy River (#3)"],[1,"now if you can, sir!      And up went my hat in the air!       Then loud from the lawn and the garden      Rose offers of 'Ten to one _ON!_'     'Who'll bet on the field?  I back Pardon!'      No use; all the money was gone.     He came for the third heat light-hearted,      A-jumping and dancing about;     The others were done ere they started      Crestfallen, and tired, and worn out.       He won it, and ran it much faster      Than even the first, I believe     Oh, he was the daddy, the master,      Was Pardon, the son of Reprieve.     He showed 'em the method to travel --      The boy sat as still as a stone --     They never could see him for gravel;      He came in hard-held, and alone.           .   .   .   .   .       But he's old -- and his eyes are grown hollow;       Like me, with my thatch of the snow;     When he dies, then I hope I may follow,      And go where the racehorses go.     I don't want no harping nor singing --      Such things with my style don't agree;     Where the hoofs of the horses are ringing      There's music sufficient for me.       And surely the thoroughbred horses      Will rise up again and begin     Fresh races on far-away courses,      And p'raps they might let me slip in.     It would look rather well the race-card on      'Mongst Cherubs and Seraphs and things,     'Angel Harrison's black gelding Pardon,      Blue halo, white body and wings.'       And if they have racing hereafter,      (And who is to say they will not?)     When the cheers and the shouting and laughter      Proclaim that the battle grows hot;     As they come down the racecourse a-steering,      He'll rush to the front, I believe;     And you'll hear the great multitude cheering      For Pardon, the son of Reprieve.          Clancy of the Overflow           I had written him a letter which I had, for want of better      Knowledge, sent to where I met him down the Lachlan, years ago,     He was shearing when I knew him, so I sent the letter to him,      Just 'on spec', addressed as follows, 'Clancy, of The Overflow'.       And an answer came directed in a writing unexpected,      (And I think the same was written with a thumb-nail dipped in tar)     'Twas his shearing mate who wrote it, and verbatim I will quote it:      'Clancy's gone to Queensland droving, and we don't know where he are.'           .   .   .   .   .       In my wild erratic fancy visions come to me of Clancy      Gone a-droving 'down the Cooper' where the Western drovers go;     As the stock are slowly stringing, Clancy rides behind them singing,      For the drover's life has pleasures that the townsfolk never know.       And the bush hath friends to meet him, and their kindly voices greet him      In the murmur of the breezes and the river on its bars,     And he sees the vision splendid of the sunlit plains extended,      And at night the wond'rous glory of the everlasting stars.           .   .   .   .   .       I am sitting in my dingy little office, where a stingy      Ray of sunlight struggles feebly down between the houses tall,     And the foetid air and gritty of the dusty, dirty city      Through the open window floating, spreads its foulness over all       And in place of lowing cattle, I can hear the fiendish rattle      Of the tramways and the 'buses making hurry down the street,     And the language uninviting of the gutter children fighting,      Comes fitfully and faintly through the ceaseless tramp of feet.       And the hurrying people daunt me, and their pallid faces haunt me      As they shoulder one another in their rush and nervous haste,     With their eager eyes and greedy, and their stunted forms and weedy,      For townsfolk have no time to grow, they have no time to waste.       And I somehow rather fancy that I'd like to change with Clancy,      Like to take a turn at droving where the seasons come and go,     While he faced the round eternal of the cash-book and the journal --      But I doubt he'd suit the office, Clancy, of 'The Overflow'.          Conroy's Gap           This was the way of it, don't you know --      Ryan was 'wanted' for stealing sheep,     And never a trooper, high or low,      Could find him -- catch a weasel asleep!     Till Trooper Scott, from the Stockman's Ford --      A bushman, too, as I've heard them tell --     Chanced to find him drunk as a lord      Round at the Shadow of Death Hotel.       D'you know the place?  It's a wayside inn,      A low grog-shanty -- a bushman trap,     Hiding away in its shame and sin      Under the shelter of Conroy's Gap --     Under the shade of that frowning range,      The roughest crowd that ever drew breath --     Thieves and rowdies, uncouth and strange,      Were mustered round at the Shadow of Death.       The trooper knew that his man would slide      Like a dingo pup, if he saw the chance;     And with half a start on the mountain side      Ryan would lead him a merry dance.     Drunk as he was when the trooper came,      To him that did not matter a rap --     Drunk or sober, he was the same,      The boldest rider in Conroy's Gap.       'I want you, Ryan,' the trooper said,      'And listen to me, if you dare resist,     So help me heaven, I'll shoot you dead!'      He snapped the steel on his prisoner's wrist,     And Ryan, hearing the handcuffs click,      Recovered his wits as they turned to go,     For fright will sober a man as quick      As all the drugs that the doctors know.       There was a girl in that rough bar      Went by the name of Kate Carew,     Quiet and shy as the bush girls are,      But ready-witted and plucky, too.     She loved this Ryan, or so they say,      And passing by, while her eyes were dim     With tears, she said in a careless way,      'The Swagman's round in the stable, Jim.'       Spoken too low for the trooper's ear,      Why should she care if he heard or not?     Plenty of swagmen far and near,      And yet to Ryan it meant a lot.     That was the name of the grandest horse      In all the district from east to west     In every show ring, on every course      They always counted the Swagman best.       He was a wonder, a raking bay --      One of the grand old Snowdon strain --     One of the sort that could race and stay      With his mighty limbs and his length of rein.     Born and bred on the mountain side,      He could race through scrub like a kangaroo,     The girl herself on his back might ride,      And the Swagman would carry her safely through.       He would travel gaily from daylight's flush      Till after the stars hung out their lamps,     There was never his like in the open bush,      And never his match on the cattle-camps.     For faster horses might well be found      On racing tracks, or a plain's extent,     But few, if any, on broken ground      Could see the way that the Swagman went.       When this girl's father, old Jim Carew,      Was droving out on the Castlereagh     With Conroy's cattle, a wire came through      To say that his wife couldn't live the day.     And he was a hundred miles from home,      As flies the crow, with never a track,     Through plains as pathless as ocean's foam,      He mounted straight on the Swagman's back.       He left the camp by the sundown light,      And the settlers out on the Marthaguy     Awoke and heard, in the dead of night,      A single horseman hurrying by.     He crossed the Bogan at Dandaloo,      And many a mile of the silent plain     That lonely rider behind him threw      Before they settled to sleep again.       He rode all night and he steered his course      By the shining stars with a bushman's skill,     And every time that he pressed his horse      The Swagman answered him gamely still.     He neared his home as the east was bright,      The doctor met him outside the town:     'Carew!  How far did you come last night?'      'A hundred miles since the sun went down.'       And his wife got round, and an oath he passed,      So long as he or one of his breed     Could raise a coin, though it took their last      The Swagman never should want a feed.     And Kate Carew, when her father died,      She kept the horse and she kept him well:     The pride of the district far and wide,      He lived in style at the bush hotel.       Such was the Swagman; and Ryan knew      Nothing about could pace the crack;     Little he'd care for the man in blue      If once he got on the Swagman's back.     But how to do it?  A word let fall      Gave him the hint as the girl passed by;     Nothing but 'Swagman -- stable-wall;      'Go to the stable and mind your eye.'       He caught her meaning, and quickly turned      To the trooper:  'Reckon you'll gain a stripe     By arresting me, and it's easily earned;      Let's go to the stable and get my pipe,     The Swagman has it.'  So off they went,      And soon as ever they turned their backs     The girl slipped down, on some errand bent      Behind the stable, and seized an axe.       The trooper stood at the stable door      While Ryan went in quite cool and slow,     And then (the trick had been played before)      The girl outside gave the wall a blow.     Three slabs fell out of the stable wall --      'Twas done 'fore ever the trooper knew --     And Ryan, as soon as he saw them fall,      Mounted the Swagman and rushed him through.       The trooper heard the hoof-beats ring      In the stable yard, and he slammed the gate,     But the Swagman rose with a mighty spring      At the fence, and the trooper fired too late,     As they raced away and his shots flew wide      And Ryan no longer need care a rap,     For never a horse that was lapped in hide      Could catch the Swagman in Conroy's Gap.       And that's the story.  You want to know      If Ryan came back to his Kate Carew;     Of course he should have, as stories go,      But the worst of it is, this story's true:     And in real life it's a certain rule,      Whatever poets and authors say     Of high-t"]]]
