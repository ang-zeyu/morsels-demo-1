[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18637"],[0,"The Constitution of the United States of America: Analysis and Interpretation (#3)"],[1,"the way of the theory that Judicial Review is  preservative of the Constitution is confronted when we turn to consider  the statistical aspects of the matter. The suggestion that the  Constitution of the United States contained in embryo from the beginning  the entirety of our national Constitutional Law confronts the will to  believe with an altogether impossible test. Compared with the  Constitutional Document, with its 7,000 words more or less, the bulk of  material requiring to be noticed in the preparation of an annotation of  this kind is simply immense. First and last, the Court has probably  decided well over 4,000 cases involving questions of constitutional  interpretation. In many instances, to be sure, the constitutional issue  was disposed of quite briefly. In some instances, on the other hand, the  published report of the case runs to more than 200 pages.[9] In the  total, it is probable that at least 50,000 pages of the United States  Supreme Court Reports are devoted to Constitutional Law topics.    Nor is this the whole story, or indeed the most important part of it.  Even more striking is the fact that the vast proportion of cases forming  the corpus of national Constitutional Law has stemmed, or has purported  to stem, from four or five brief phrases of the Constitutional Document,  the power \"to regulate ... commerce among the States,\" impairment of  \"the obligation of contracts\" (now practically dried up as a formal  source of constitutional law), deprivation of \"liberty or property  without due process of law\" (which phrase occurs both as a limitation on  the National Government and, since 1868, on the States), and out of four  or five doctrines which the Constitution is assumed to embody. The  latter are, in truth, the essence of the matter, for it is through these  doctrines, and under the cover which they afford, that outside  interests, ideas, preconceptions, have found their way into  Constitutional Law, have indeed become for better, for worse, its  leavening element.    That is to say, the effectiveness of Constitutional Law as a system of  restraints on governmental action in the United States, which is its  primary _raison d'etre_, depends for the most part on the effectiveness  of these doctrines as they are applied by the Court to that purpose. The  doctrines to which I refer are (1) the doctrine or concept of  Federalism; (2) the doctrine of the Separation of Powers; (3) the  concept of a Government of Laws and not of Men, as opposed especially to  indefinite conceptions of presidential power; (4) and the substantive  doctrine of Due Process of Law and attendant conceptions of Liberty.  What I proposed to do is to take up each of these doctrines or concepts  in turn, tell something of their earlier history, and then project  against this background a summary account of what has happened to them  in recent years in consequence of the impact of war, of economic crisis,  and of the political and ideological reaction to the latter during the  Administrations of Franklin D. Roosevelt.      I    Federalism    Federalism in the United States embraces the following elements: (1) as  in all federations, the union of several autonomous political entities,  or \"States,\" for common purposes; (2) the division of legislative powers  between a \"National Government,\" on the one hand, and constituent  \"States,\" on the other, which division is governed by the rule that the  former is \"a government of enumerated powers\" while the latter are  governments of \"residual powers\"; (3) the direct operation, for the most  part, of each of these centers of government, within its assigned  sphere, upon all persons and property within its territorial limits; (4)  the provision of each center with the complete apparatus of law  enforcement, both executive and judicial; (5) the supremacy of the  \"National Government\" within its assigned sphere over any conflicting  assertion of \"state\" power; (6) dual citizenship.    The third and fourth of the above-listed salient features of the  American Federal System are the ones which at the outset marked it off  most sharply from all preceding systems, in which the member states  generally agreed to obey the mandates of a common government for certain  stipulated purposes, but retained to themselves the right of ordaining  and enforcing the laws of the union. This, indeed, was the system  provided in the Articles of Confederation. The Convention of 1787 was  well aware, of course, that if the inanities and futilities of the  Confederation were to be avoided in the new system, the latter must  incorporate \"a coercive principle\"; and as Ellsworth of Connecticut  expressed it, the only question was whether it should be \"a coercion of  law, or a coercion of arms,\" that \"coercion which acts only upon  delinquent individuals\" or that which is applicable to \"sovereign  bodies, states, in their political capacity.\"[10] In Judicial Review the  former principle was established, albeit without entirely discarding  the latter, as the War between the States was to demonstrate.    The sheer fact of Federalism enters the purview of Constitutional Law,  that is, becomes a judicial concept, in consequence of the conflicts  which have at times arisen between the idea of State Autonomy (\"State  Sovereignty\") and the principle of National Supremacy. Exaltation of the  latter principle, as it is recognized in the Supremacy Clause (Article  VI, paragraph 2) of the Constitution, was the very keystone of Chief  Justice Marshall's constitutional jurisprudence. It was Marshall's  position that the supremacy clause was intended to be applied literally,  so that if an unforced reading of the terms in which legislative power  was granted to Congress confirmed its right to enact a particular  statute, the circumstance that the statute projected national power into  a hitherto accustomed field of state power with unavoidable curtailment  of the latter was a matter of indifference. State power, as Madison in  his early nationalistic days phrased it, was \"no criterion of national  power,\" and hence no independent limitation thereof.    Quite different was the outlook of the Court over which Marshall's  successor, Taney, presided. That Court took as its point of departure  the Tenth Amendment, which reads, \"The powers not delegated to the  United States by this Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States,  are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\" In  construing this provision the Court under Taney sometimes talked as if  it regarded all the reserved powers of the States as limiting national  power; at other times it talked as if it regarded certain subjects as  reserved exclusively to the States, slavery being, of course, the  outstanding instance.[11]    But whether following the one line of reasoning or the other, the Taney  Court subtly transformed its function, and so that of Judicial Review,  in relation to the Federal System. Marshall viewed the Court as  primarily an organ of the National Government and of its supremacy. The  Court under Taney regarded itself as standing outside of and above both  the National Government and the States, and as vested with a  quasi-arbitral function between two centers of diverse, but essentially  equal, because \"sovereign\", powers. Thus in Ableman _v._ Booth, which  was decided on the eve of the War between the States, we find Taney  himself using this arresting language:         This judicial power was justly regarded as indispensable, not       merely to maintain the supremacy of the laws of the United       States, but also to guard the States from any encroachment       upon their reserved rights by the general government.... So       long ... as this Constitution shall endure, this tribunal must       exist with it, deciding in the peaceful forms of judicial       proceeding, the angry and irritating controversies between       sovereignties, which in other countries have been determined       by the arbitrament of force.[12]    It is, therefore, the Taney Court, rather than the Marshall Court, which  elaborated the concept of Dual Federalism. Marshall's federalism is more  aptly termed national federalism; and turning to modern issues, we may  say without exaggeration that the broad general constitutional issue  between the Court and the Franklin D. Roosevelt program in such cases as  Schechter Corp. _v._ United States and Carter _v._ Carter Coal Co.[13]  was, whether Marshall's or Taney's brand of federalism should prevail.  More precisely, the issue in these cases was whether Congress' power to  regulate commerce must stop short of regulating the employer-employee  relationship in industrial production, that having been hitherto  regulated by the States. In Justice Sutherland's words in the Carter  case:         Much stress is put upon the evils which come from the struggle       between employers and employees over the matter of wages,       working conditions, the right of collective bargaining, etc.,       and the resulting strikes, curtailment and irregularity of       production and effect on prices; and it is insisted that       interstate commerce is greatly affected thereby.... The       conclusive answer is that the evils are all local evils over       which the Federal Government has no legislative control. The       relation of employer and employee is a local relation. At       common law, it is one of the domestic relations. The wages are       paid for the doing of local work. Working conditions are       obviously local conditions. The employees are not engaged in       or about commerce, but exclusively in producing a commodity.       And the controversies and evils, which it is the object of the       act to regulate and minimize, are local controversies and       evils affecting local work undertaken to accomplish that local       result. Such effect as they may have upon commerce, however       extensive it "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1864"],[0,"Hero Tales from American History (#3)"],[1,"was, perhaps, more characteristic of the man  and his greatness than any other. This was his perfect veracity of mind.  He was, of course, the soul of truth and honor, but he was even more  than that. He never deceived himself He always looked facts squarely in  the face and dealt with them as such, dreaming no dreams, cherishing no  delusions, asking no impossibilities,--just to others as to himself, and  thus winning alike in war and in peace.    He gave dignity as well as victory to his country and his cause. He was,  in truth, a \"character for after ages to admire.\"          DANIEL BOONE AND THE FOUNDING OF KENTUCKY        ... Boone lived hunting up to ninety;       And, what's still stranger, left behind a name        For which men vainly decimate the throng,       Not only famous, but of that GOOD fame,        Without which glory's but a tavern song,--       Simple, serene, the antipodes of shame,        Which hate nor envy e'er could tinge with wrong;         'T is true he shrank from men, even of his nation;        When they built up unto his darling trees,       He moved some hundred miles off, for a station        Where there were fewer houses and more ease;                           * * *         But where he met the individual man,       He showed himself as kind as mortal can.                           * * *         The freeborn forest found and kept them free,       And fresh as is a torrent or a tree.         And tall, and strong, and swift of foot were they,        Beyond the dwarfing city's pale abortions,       Because their thoughts had never been the prey        Of care or gain; the green woods were their portions                              * * *         Simple they were, not savage; and their rifles,       Though very true, were yet not used for trifles.                              * * *         Serene, not sullen, were the solitudes       Of this unsighing people of the woods.                        --Byron.      Daniel Boone will always occupy a unique place in our history as the  archetype of the hunter and wilderness wanderer. He was a true pioneer,  and stood at the head of that class of Indian-fighters, game-hunters,  forest-fellers, and backwoods farmers who, generation after generation,  pushed westward the border of civilization from the Alleghanies to the  Pacific. As he himself said, he was \"an instrument ordained of God to  settle the wilderness.\" Born in Pennsylvania, he drifted south into  western North Carolina, and settled on what was then the extreme  frontier. There he married, built a log cabin, and hunted, chopped  trees, and tilled the ground like any other frontiersman. The Alleghany  Mountains still marked a boundary beyond which the settlers dared not  go; for west of them lay immense reaches of frowning forest, uninhabited  save by bands of warlike Indians. Occasionally some venturesome hunter  or trapper penetrated this immense wilderness, and returned with strange  stories of what he had seen and done.    In 1769 Boone, excited by these vague and wondrous tales, determined  himself to cross the mountains and find out what manner of land it was  that lay beyond. With a few chosen companions he set out, making his own  trail through the gloomy forest. After weeks of wandering, he at last  emerged into the beautiful and fertile country of Kentucky, for which,  in after years, the red men and the white strove with such obstinate  fury that it grew to be called \"the dark and bloody ground.\" But when  Boone first saw it, it was a fair and smiling land of groves and glades  and running waters, where the open forest grew tall and beautiful, and  where innumerable herds of game grazed, roaming ceaselessly to and fro  along the trails they had trodden during countless generations. Kentucky  was not owned by any Indian tribe, and was visited only by wandering  war-parties and hunting-parties who came from among the savage nations  living north of the Ohio or south of the Tennessee.    A roving war-party stumbled upon one of Boone's companions and killed  him, and the others then left Boone and journeyed home; but his  brother came out to join him, and the two spent the winter together.  Self-reliant, fearless, and the frowning defiles of Cumberland Gap, they  were attacked by Indians, and driven back--two of Boone's own sons being  slain. In 1775, however, he made another attempt; and this attempt was  successful. The Indians attacked the newcomers; but by this time the  parties of would-be settlers were sufficiently numerous to hold their  own. They beat back the Indians, and built rough little hamlets,  surrounded by log stockades, at Boonesborough and Harrodsburg; and the  permanent settlement of Kentucky had begun.    The next few years were passed by Boone amid unending Indian conflicts.  He was a leader among the settlers, both in peace and in war. At one  time he represented them in the House of Burgesses of Virginia; at  another time he was a member of the first little Kentucky parliament  itself; and he became a colonel of the frontier militia. He tilled the  land, and he chopped the trees himself; he helped to build the cabins  and stockades with his own hands, wielding the longhandled, light-headed  frontier ax as skilfully as other frontiersmen. His main business was  that of surveyor, for his knowledge of the country, and his ability to  travel through it, in spite of the danger from Indians, created much  demand for his services among people who wished to lay off tracts of  wild land for their own future use. But whatever he did, and wherever he  went, he had to be sleeplessly on the lookout for his Indian foes. When  he and his fellows tilled the stump-dotted fields of corn, one or more  of the party were always on guard, with weapon at the ready, for fear of  lurking savages. When he went to the House of Burgesses he carried his  long rifle, and traversed roads not a mile of which was free from the  danger of Indian attack. The settlements in the early years depended  exclusively upon game for their meat, and Boone was the mightiest of all  the hunters, so that upon him devolved the task of keeping his people  supplied. He killed many buffaloes, and pickled the buffalo beef for  use in winter. He killed great numbers of black bear, and made bacon of  them, precisely as if they had been hogs. The common game were deer and  elk. At that time none of the hunters of Kentucky would waste a shot on  anything so small as a prairie-chicken or wild duck; but they sometimes  killed geese and swans when they came south in winter and lit on the  rivers.    But whenever Boone went into the woods after game, he had perpetually to  keep watch lest he himself might be hunted in turn. He never lay in wait  at a game-lick, save with ears strained to hear the approach of some  crawling red foe. He never crept up to a turkey he heard calling,  without exercising the utmost care to see that it was not an Indian;  for one of the favorite devices of the Indians was to imitate the turkey  call, and thus allure within range some inexperienced hunter.    Besides this warfare, which went on in the midst of his usual vocations,  Boone frequently took the field on set expeditions against the savages.  Once when he and a party of other men were making salt at a lick, they  were surprised and carried off by the Indians. The old hunter was a  prisoner with them for some months, but finally made his escape and came  home through the trackless woods as straight as the wild pigeon flies.  He was ever on the watch to ward off the Indian inroads, and to follow  the warparties, and try to rescue the prisoners. Once his own daughter,  and two other girls who were with her, were carried off by a band of  Indians. Boone raised some friends and followed the trail steadily for  two days and a night; then they came to where the Indians had killed a  buffalo calf and were camped around it. Firing from a little distance,  the whites shot two of the Indians, and, rushing in, rescued the girls.  On another occasion, when Boone had gone to visit a salt-lick with his  brother, the Indians ambushed them and shot the latter. Boone himself  escaped, but the Indians followed him for three miles by the aid of  a tracking dog, until Boone turned, shot the dog, and then eluded his  pursuers. In company with Simon Kenton and many other noted hunters and  wilderness warriors, he once and again took part in expeditions into the  Indian country, where they killed the braves and drove off the horses.  Twice bands of Indians, accompanied by French, Tory, and British  partizans from Detroit, bearing the flag of Great Britain, attacked  Boonesboroug. In each case Boone and his fellow-settlers beat them off  with loss. At the fatal battle of the Blue Licks, in which two hundred  of the best riflemen of Kentucky were beaten with terrible slaughter by  a great force of Indians from the lakes, Boone commanded the left wing.  Leading his men, rifle in hand, he pushed back and overthrew the force  against him; but meanwhile the Indians destroyed the right wing and  center, and got round in his rear, so that there was nothing left for  Boone's men except to flee with all possible speed.    As Kentucky became settled, Boone grew restless and ill at ease.  He loved the wilderness; he loved the great forests and the great  prairie-like glades, and the life in the little lonely cabin, where from  the door he could see the deer come out into the clearing at nightfall.  The neighborhood of his own kind made him feel cramped and ill at ease.  So he moved ever westward with the frontier; and as Kentucky filled up  he crossed the Mississippi and settled on the borders of the prairie  country of Missouri, where the Spaniards, who ruled the territory, made  him an alcalde, or judge. He lived to a great age, and died out on the  border, a backwoods hunter to the last.          GEORGE ROGERS CLARK AND THE CONQUEST OF THE NORTHWEST   "]]]
