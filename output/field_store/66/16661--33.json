[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20348"],[0,"The Moving Picture Girls in War Plays (#3)"],[1,"to \"Oak Farm,\" as told in the  second volume, where scenes for farm dramas were filmed. Pop could use a  drawbridge in one scene, and, in the next, convert it into a perfectly  good cow-barn. Pop was a valuable man.    There were other members of the company, of more or less importance,  whom you will meet as this story progresses.    It was in the third volume of the series, \"The Moving Picture Girls  Snowbound,\" that Ruth and Alice succeeded in getting \"the proof on the  film\" that saved Mr. DeVere from an unjust charge.    From the cold and frostiness of Deerfield the girls went to Florida,  where \"Under the Palms,\" many stirring acts were filmed. It was here  that Alice and Ruth helped find two girls who were lost in the wilds of  the Everglades.    \"The Moving Picture Girls at Rocky Ranch\" gave Ruth and Alice a taste of  cowboy life, and though rivals tried to spoil some of the valuable  films, they were not altogether successful, even though a prairie fire  figured in their schemes.    The girls, with their father, had recently returned from a perilous  trip. This is told about in the volume immediately preceding the one you  are reading--\"The Moving Picture Girls at Sea.\" In that Alice and Ruth  proved, not only their versatility as actresses, but also that they  could be brave and resourceful in the face of danger. And they more than  repaid the old sailor, Jack Jepson, who saved their lives, by doing him  a good turn.    \"Well, life at Oak Farm will be vastly different from that on the _Mary  Ellen_,\" remarked Alice, as she looked from the automobile as it swung  along through the New York streets on the way to the park.    \"Yes,\" agreed her sister. \"But I like it up there.\"    \"There are going to be some strenuous times,\" said Paul. \"We've got to  do some hustling work.\"    \"All the better,\" declared Russ. \"I like to keep the film running. This  sitting about all day and reeling off only ten feet makes me tired.\"    \"You like action!\" laughed Ruth.    \"Yes; and plenty of it.\"    Oak Farm was the property of the Apgars. There was Mr. Belix Apgar, the  father, Nance, his wife, and Sandy, an energetic son. The farm was  located in New Jersey, about forty miles from New York, and it provided  a picturesque background for the scenes evolved by Mr. Pertell and his  company. It was during a scene on the farm, some time before, that a  valuable discovery had been made, which endeared the moving picture  girls and their chums to the Apgars.    \"How did Mr. Pertell come to pick out Oak Farm for the war plays?\" asked  Ruth, as the automobile bounced along.    \"Well, I suggested it to him,\" answered Russ. \"I remembered the  background, and I felt sure we could get all sorts of settings there to  make the proper scenes. There are hills, mountains, valleys, streams,  bridges, waterfalls, cliffs and caves. Everything needed for perfectly  good war dramas.\"    \"How did they come to want that sort of stuff?\" asked Paul.    \"Oh, war stuff is going big now,\" Russ answered. \"All this talk of  preparedness, you know, the war in Europe, and all that. The public is  fairly 'eating up' war pictures.\"    \"I hope we don't have to fire any guns!\" exclaimed Ruth, with a shudder.    \"You'll see and hear plenty of 'em fired,\" Russ told her. \"There are to  be some big battle scenes and cavalry charges. But one of you will be  back of the firing line, I believe.\"    \"How is that?\" asked Alice.    \"Well, one of you girls is to be cast for an army nurse, and the other  will be a spy. The spy has to carry a revolver.\"    \"I'm going to be the spy!\" cried Alice, impetuously. \"I know how to  shoot a gun.\"    \"I'd rather be the nurse,\" murmured Ruth, and truly she was better  fitted for that part.    \"'A Girl in Blue and A Girl in Gray' is to be the title of the war  play--or at least one of them,\" went on Russ. \"There will be some lively  scenes, and I'll be on the jump most of the time.\"    \"Are you going to film them all?\" asked Paul.    \"Oh, no. I'm to have several assistants, but I'll be in general charge  of the camera squad. So, girls, look your prettiest.\"    \"They always do that,\" said Paul.    \"Thank you!\" came in a feminine duet.    A little later the place where the retake was to be made was reached.  Mr. Bunn was on hand, wearing his air of \"Hamletian gloom,\" as Alice  whispered, and the work of retaking the scenes was soon under way.    This time all went well. Alice drove her \"flivver\" at Mr. Bunn, who was  properly knocked down and looked after by Ruth. No small boys, with an  exaggerated sense of humor, got in the way, and the girls were shortly  back in their apartment. They had moved to a more pretentious home since  their success in moving pictures, and the Dalwoods had taken an  apartment in the same building.    \"And now to get on with my packing!\" sighed Alice. \"All I am sure of is  that I have my 'brogans' in.\"    \"I'll help you,\" offered Ruth.    Two days later the Comet Film Company, augmented for the occasion, was  at the depot in Hoboken, ready to take the Lackawanna train out to Oak  Farm, New Jersey, where it nestled in the hills of Sussex County.    \"I don't see how they are going to take battle scenes with just this  company,\" observed Alice, as she surveyed her fellow workers. \"And where  are the guns and horses?\"    \"They'll come up later,\" Russ informed her. \"There are to be two big  companies and a couple of batteries, but they won't be on hand until  they are really needed. It costs too much to keep them when they are not  working.\"    \"Are you all here?\" asked Mr. Pertell hurrying along the seats with a  handful of tickets--\"counting noses,\" so to speak.    \"All here, I think,\" answered Russ.    \"Where is Carl Switzer?\" asked the manager.    \"He was here a minute ago,\" Alice said.    \"Well, he isn't here now,\" remarked Mr. Bunn.    \"And almost time for the train to start!\" exploded the director. \"We  need him in some of the first scenes to-morrow. Get him, somebody!\"    \"Hey, Mister! Does yer mean dat funny, moon-faced man what talks like a  pretzel?\" asked a newsboy in the station.    \"Yes, that's Mr. Switzer,\" was the answer. \"Where is he?\"    \"I jest seen him go out dat way,\" and the boy pointed toward the doors  leading to the street in front of the ferry. This street led over to the  interned German steamships at the Hoboken piers.          CHAPTER III    HARD AT WORK      \"Great Scott!\" ejaculated Mr. Pertell. \"I might have known that if  Switzer came anywhere near his German friends he'd be off having a  confab with them. Go after him, somebody! It's only five minutes to  train time, and it will take those Germans that long to say how-de-do to  one another, without getting down to business.\"    \"I'll get him,\" offered Paul, hurrying off toward the swinging doors.    \"I'll go wit' youse,\" said the newsboy. \"I likes t' listen t' him talk.  Does he do a Dutch act?\"    \"Sometimes,\" laughed Paul.    \"Youse is actors, ain't youse?\" the boy asked.    \"Movies,\" answered Paul, hurrying along toward the entrance to the  shipyards.    \"I wuz in 'em onct,\" went on the lad. \"Dey wuz a scene where us guys wuz  sellin' papes, an' anudder guy comes along, and t'rows a handful of  money in de street--he had so much he didn't know what t' do wit'  it--dat wuz in de picture,\" he explained. \"I wuz in de scene.\"    \"Was it real money?\" asked Paul.    \"Naw--nottin' but tin,\" and the tone expressed the disappointment that  had been experienced. \"But we each got a quarter out of it fer bein' in  de picture, so we didn't make out so worse. Dere's your friend now,\" and  the newsboy pointed to the comedian standing at the entrance to one of  the piers, talking to the watchman. Both had raised their voices high,  and were using their hands freely.    \"Hey, Mr. Switzer, come along!\" cried Paul. \"It's time for the train.\"    \"Ach! Der train! I t'ought der vos plenty of time. I vant to see a  friend of mine who is living on vun of dese wessels. Haven't I got der  time?\"    \"No, not a minute to spare. You can see him when you come back.\"    \"Ach! Maybe I neffer comes back. If I get in der war plays I may be  shotted.\"    \"Oh, come on!\" laughed Paul, while the newsboy went into amused  contortions at the exaggerated language and gestures of Mr. Switzer.    \"See you later, Hans!\" called the comedian to the watchman at the pier.    \"Ach, Himmel! Vot I care!\" the latter cried. \"I don't care even if you  comes back neffer! You can't get on dose ship!\" and he waved his hand at  the big vessels, interned to prevent their capture by the British  warships.    \"I was having quite an argument with him,\" said Mr. Switzer, speaking  \"United States,\" as he walked back to the station with Paul.    \"Wouldn't he let you go on board?\"    \"No. Took me for an English spy, I guess. But I know one of der  officers, and I thought I'd have time for a chat with him.\"    \"Mr. Pertell is in a hurry,\" said the young actor.    \"Well, if we miss this train there's another.\"    \"Not until to-morrow, and he wants to start the rehearsals the first  thing in the morning.\"    \"Ach! Den dat's differunt alretty yet again, wasn't it so?\" and Mr.  Switzer winked at the admiring newsboy, and tossed him a quarter, with  the advice to get a pretzel and use it for a watch charm. Whereat the  boy went into convulsive laughter again.    \"What do you mean, Switzer, by going off just at train time?\" demanded  the indignant director and manager.    \"Train time is der time to go off--so long as you don't go off der  track!\" declared the German. \"But I vanted to go on--not go off--I  vanted to go on der ships only dey vouldn't let me. However, better late  than be a miss vot's like a bird in der hand,\" and with a shrug of his  shoulders and a last wink at the newsboy, Mr. Switzer went out to the  waiting train with the others.    It was a long and rather tedious ride to Oak Farm, which lay some miles  back in the hills from the railroad station, and it was late afternoon "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20354"],[0,"Jack of Both Sides: The Story of a School War (#3)"],[1,"of the  approach of section number two.    \"Give us one more chance, Armie, please! I promise not to funk it again.  Listen, they're just coming!\"    \"You'll not do it,\" said Armitage.    \"Won't I, though! Look here! count three, and then give me a tiny push.\"    As Jack and the March Hare entered the saloon they heard Armitage say,  \"Very well. One, two, three; now go!\"    There was a faint, quickly-checked cry, and then a little splash. Toppin  was under the water.    The same instant the March Hare--hat, boots, and all--had leapt in, and  was fighting his way towards the deep end.    Jack's first impulse was to tear off his coat and follow the Hare's  example; but when he saw a little red head appear and immediately be  captured, and when he realized that Bacon, Simmons, and Armitage were  all swimming to the rescue, he refrained.    Although the March Hare was the first to lay hold of Toppin's crest, the  next minute he was himself in need of rescue. The Hare had only advanced  to the swimming stage when both hands and feet are absolutely necessary,  and the pause to seize his friend had sufficed, when combined with the  weight of his garments, to sink him; so Toppin dived for the second  time, in company with the March Hare.    \"Quick!\" yelled Jack, \"or there'll be two drowned! Shall I come?\"    [Illustration]    But the pair had risen again, and were clutched and violently wrenched  apart by Armitage and Bacon. For the March Hare's grip of the red locks  was very tight.    Bacon found Toppin fairly easy to land, but the Hare, in full walking  costume, was quite another matter, and Simmons's help was required.  Besides, Toppin kept quiet when commanded to, while the March Hare  fought and struggled, and had to have his head thumped severely.  Fortunately the steps were not far off, and Jack awaited them there.    He was frightened when he saw that Toppin's familiar little pink face  had changed to an ivory-white, and that his eyes were shut. Was he  senseless, or worse? Jack grasped the small, dripping body in his arms,  and staggered to where the bell hung that summoned the attendant. He  pealed it loudly, and sank down beneath it to wait. Other boys had  arrived during the incident, and were now pressing round, questioning  and jabbering. Jack had nothing to say to them. He was hard at work  chafing the motionless form, and his brain was in a whirl. What if  Toppin never moved or spoke again!    Suddenly the eyelids lifted: Toppin looked straight into Jack's face.    \"May I move now?\" he asked innocently. Oh, what a relief it was to hear  his voice!    \"You young fraud!\" exclaimed Jack; but his own voice shook, and he was  glad to surrender his charge into the hands of the attendant, a man  trained for his position. The March Hare, who was shivering beside him,  sobbed with joy when he saw one small leg draw itself up, and an arm  move a few inches, at their owner's will.    \"Top-peen! Top-peen!\" he cried. \"You are not died!\"    Toppin stared at his friend over a tea-spoon. He was sipping hot  spirits-and-water, and wondering what it was. But Jack turned upon the  March Hare.    \"We shall be standing you head downwards in a minute, Hare. You're next  door to drowning yourself. Get up, and come with me!\"    The Hare protested feebly, with chattering teeth. But the attendant  thrust a spoonful of Toppin's drink between them, and counselled Jack to  take him to his wife. That good woman stripped the Hare in a twinkling,  wrapped him in a blanket, and set him before her kitchen fire to watch  his garments dry. Jack meanwhile returned to the saloon, to find Toppin  clothed once more, and curled up on the matting, near the heating  apparatus, munching a biscuit.    \"How do you feel now, Top?\" he asked, stooping to see his face.    \"Pretty bobbish, thanks, Brady,\" was the answer, and it told that Toppin  was himself again.    \"You'll have to look sharp if you want a dip, Brady,\" called Green.  \"Andy'll be round in a minute, I expect.\"    \"Thanks! I'm not bathing to-day,\" was the response.    Just then Escombe Trevelyan, who was swimming lazily about, landed at  the steps close by, and beckoned Jack to come nearer.    \"I want to hear the truth of this affair, Brady,\" he began in a  confidential undertone. \"Did you see it happen?\"    \"Which part? I saw the March Hare leap in with his hat on his head and  his towel on his arm. He did look properly mad, I can tell you!\"    \"I mean before that, when Toppin went under.\"    \"They say he actually took a dive from the board, don't they?\"    \"Yes, but I want to get hold of someone who saw it. I can't understand  his being such an absolute little fool, and I can't worry the kid  himself about it just at present.\"    So saying, Escombe swam off once more.    Armitage was the next to approach Jack. He looked rather pale, but began  by talking rapidly about a paper-chase that was being planned. Jack knew  well enough that this was not what he wanted to talk about, but he  walked away from the bath with him, still pleasantly discussing starts  and times, till they found themselves alone on the stone stairs. Then  Armitage came to a stand-still, and his tone changed.    \"Brady, I want to speak to you; I want to explain, you know, about  Toppin.\"    \"Oh, I saw you push!\" remarked Jack bluntly.    \"I'm not going to deny it, but do you know that he begged me to? You  came in too late to hear that.\"    \"If I hand you a pistol and ask you to shoot me, will you do it?\"    \"Don't be a fool, Brady. There was no danger. I shouldn't have let him  drown.\"    \"He precious nearly did.\"    \"That was the March Hare's fault. I shouldn't have let him sink again.\"    \"Then you think you were right to push him in, Armitage? I don't. Shall  we ask Anderson's opinion?\"    \"No, Jack, I beg and implore you to keep it dark. Of course I should  never do it again. But Simmons and Bacon have sworn not to bring me into  the affair. Toppin knows it was his own fault, and is a bit ashamed of  it. There's only the March Hare besides yourself. I thought perhaps you  might persuade him--\"    A shadow darkened the open entrance. There was a stamping on the  door-mat, and then Mr. Anderson appeared on the stairs. Jack advanced to  meet him.    \"Finished your bath, Brady?\"    \"Yes, sir. I mean, I haven't had one. All the rest have. I wanted to  tell you there's been a little--a little commotion, sir.\"    \"What on earth do you mean? Not an accident?\"    \"No, sir; only it might have been. Toppin--little Trevelyan, that  is--got into the deep end, and the March Hare--you know the boy I mean,  sir--he thought he was drowning, and jumped in after him with his things  on, and so they had to haul them both out. Toppin's as right as a trivet  again, and as warm as a toast. And the Hare isn't hurt either, but he  has to sit in a blanket and wait for his clothes to dry.\"    Mr. Anderson looked very agitated, and his voice betrayed his feelings.    \"Why couldn't you behave as if I was with you? Really, it is absurd to  think that all you elder lads can't manage to keep an eye on the juniors  for twenty minutes. Where are these two boys? Take me to them directly!  What do you suppose Mr. West will say? He'll certainly be extremely  angry with you all. I shouldn't be surprised if he stops your coming  here.\"    \"We wondered whether you would feel obliged to tell him, sir,\" said Jack  thoughtfully. \"Of course, if you must, you must; but it doesn't seem as  if there was much to be gained by it, does there? The March Hare and  Toppin have learnt their lesson pretty thoroughly.\"    Mr. Anderson frowned and bit his finger, and the toe of his boot  tap-tapped on the ground. It was evident he was undecided. Presently he  looked at Jack.    \"You mean that, provided I find these two lads absolutely none the worse  for their ducking, you beg me, as a great favour, not to carry a report  to Mr. West?\"    \"Yes, sir,\" Jack responded briskly.    \"Well, I won't promise, but I'll think it over.\"    Mr. Anderson's thought ended in a decision which he announced to the  boys when they were gathered together.    \"For once, and once only, I have consented to spare you all from certain  punishment by not reporting to Mr. West this accident, which you ought  to have prevented. But you must never ask or expect to be shielded by me  again. Now we will go for a brisk walk as usual, and call for Graglia  and Trevelyan minor on the way back. I dare say they will be ready for  us by that time.\"    Now, none of the boys, except those immediately concerned in the  accident, had realized that they were in any danger of punishment; but  when the matter was set before them in this light, their gratitude to  Mr. Anderson was profound.    \"Oh, thank you!\"    \"Thank you, sir, very much!\"    \"It sha'n't happen again, sir!\"    \"Thank you awfully, sir!\"    Pleasure and surprise were equally mingled in the boys' expressions. But  Jack caught a murmur from Cadbury, very soft and low,    \"It's six for us, and half a dozen for yourself, eh, Andy?\"          CHAPTER III    THE CHICKEN AND THE BICYCLE      Mr. West, the master of Brincliffe, was a man of independent mind, and  though the boys liked him well enough, there was a difference of opinion  regarding his regulations. For example, the same term in which the door  was opened to day-pupils, it was shut to hampers, even birthday ones.  Cadbury suggested reporting this high-handed act to the Society for the  Prevention of Cruelty to Children, but decided to let him off when a  permission was announced which almost atoned for the loss of cakes and  preserves. Bicycles were allowed!    Every boy who had one might bring it to school, although, of course,  there were strict limits to its uses, and he who misused the privilege  laid himself open to the heavy penalty of leaving it at home the next  term. The plan worked well, and gave huge pleasure to the pupils.    With the exception of such small fry as the March"]]]
