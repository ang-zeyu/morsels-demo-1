This definite and most important step, however, should be taken with the  greatest care and caution, prudence and thoughtfulness. Due regard must be  paid to their actual capacity and present attainments, and only those who  are best qualified for membership, be they men or women, and irrespective  of social standing, should be elected to the extremely responsible  position of a member of the Baha'i Assembly.    This momentous decision, I trust, will prove to be a great incentive to  the women Baha'is throughout India and Burma who, I hope, will now bestir  themselves and endeavour to the best of their ability to acquire a better  and more profound knowledge of the Cause, to take a more active and  systematic part in the general affairs of the Movement, and prove  themselves in every way enlightened, responsible and efficient co-workers  to their fellow-men in their common task for the advancement of the Cause  throughout their country.    May they fully realise their high responsibilities in this day, may they  do all in their power to justify the high hopes we cherish for their  future, and may they prove themselves in every respect worthy of the noble  mission which the Baha'i world is now entrusting to their charge.    December 27, 1923          The Baha'i News      [From the Guardian:]    Your long-awaited letter, penned by our dear and devoted brother, Mr. N.  R. Vakil, has been received and read with profound interest. I note with  deep satisfaction the vigour and earnestness with which you are conducting  the affairs of the Movement throughout the length and breadth of that vast  and distant land, and ardently pray that you may achieve, individually and  collectively, the highest success in all your endeavours.    Regarding the Baha'i News, I strongly urge those responsible for its  publication, and in particular, our beloved friends, Prof. Pritam Singh,  Mr. Vakil, ... Mr. M. U. Abasi, Mirza Niku, Mr. Ardeshir Khodadad, and  Haji Ahmad, to do their utmost that this Baha'i organ may increase in  volume, widen in scope, broaden in its outlook, improve in style and  general presentation, and reflect more extensively the activities of the  friends in India, Burma, and elsewhere. As a magazine that has been  established in the days of our departed Master, and been the recipient of  His special favours and blessings, it ought, and I have no doubt it will,  with your active support and under your constant and general supervision,  carry out the great plan it is destined to fulfill in this world.    With regard to Burma and its Baha'i activities, I trust you realise that  that province falls directly within the sphere of your activities, and  although a Central Council for all Burma is in the process of  establishment, that Council as well as all local Assemblies throughout  Burma will have to be under the protection, care and direction of the  All-India Spiritual Assembly.    I would indeed welcome regular, frequent and comprehensive reports from  the National Assembly on the various branches of its manifold activities,  and will spare no effort to contribute my humble share in consolidating  and extending the Teaching Campaign throughout that vast Dominion.    I would be pleased to receive the permanent postal and telegraphic address  of the Secretary of the National Assembly, and am confident that by the  grace of Baha'u'llah and under the guiding Hand of our beloved Master, we  shall all carry triumphantly the noble task entrusted to our charge to a  speedy and successful conclusion.    June 1, 1923          An Era of Unprecedented Activity      [From the Guardian:]    It is a great pleasure and privilege for me to renew the bonds of  fellowship and affection that have always united our hearts in the service  of our beloved Master. I need not recall to your minds the warm and  abiding place which that gifted Dominion has always occupied in our  Beloved's heart, and the high hopes he cherished for its future  contribution towards the triumph of the Movement in those distant regions  of the earth.    I am sure the hour has struck when those dearly-beloved pioneers of the  Master's Cause, scattered throughout the length and breadth of that vast  and promising land, should unite, consolidate their forces, and  effectively combine for the laying of a firm foundation for the future  progress of their noble task. It is my earnest hope and my most cherished  desire that at the forthcoming Convention the vigour and enlightened  efforts of the Baha'i youth of India, coupled with the generous support  and devotion of the old beloved Parsee friends, and reinforced by the vast  numbers of the ardent followers of the Faith in Burma, may, by imparting  power and brilliancy to its proceedings, herald an era of unprecedented  activity for the ultimate recognition of the Cause by the peoples of that  country.    I shall welcome with genuine satisfaction every effort which that talented  and untiring servant of Baha'u'llah, our highly-esteemed sister Mrs.  Stannard, may exert in this connection, and would feel truly gratified to  learn of her determination to play a conspicuous part in the presentation  of the Cause to the eyes of the enlightened public. May the sustaining  grace of God, the power of Baha'u'llah, and the loving counsels of our  beloved 'Abdu'l-Baha guide you and aid you in your mighty endeavours for  the accomplishment of your task.    I shall eagerly await any particulars you might wish to send me regarding  your various activities in the service of the Cause, and I trust that  during the interval between now and Ridvan a complete and careful  arrangement for the successful conduct of the coming Convention will have  been drawn by all the friends and assemblies of India and Burma, and to  which, I assure you, I shall be most pleased to contribute my humble share  of cooperation and advice.    Hoping to hear from you, individually and collectively, and assuring you  of my constant prayers on your behalf.    December 5, 1923          Nothing Must Dampen Our Zeal      Nothing, I dare say, can be more encouraging and gladsome to Shoghi  Effendi than the news of the activities of the friends in such a vast and  promising field as India. In the last few years the harvest of the  friends' endeavours was not as rich and abundant as we all would wish and  undoubtedly the political throes through which India has been passing and  the general unrest which such conditions have brought about, account to a  large measure for this comparative unfruitfulness in the self-sacrificing  efforts of the Indian Baha'is. Yet nothing must damp our zeal and we  cannot for a moment doubt the remarkable change that the Master said would  take place in that country.    We have been all very much interested in the first-hand information which  Mrs. Stannard has given us and we lament the formidable difficulties and  obstacles with which the Baha'is must cope in their effort to imbue the  individual with a new spirit and to bring new measures of reform in the  social order. We shall, however, pray for you all and eagerly await every  good news you have to share with us.    [From the Guardian:]    I always eagerly await detailed and frequent reports from the National  Assembly and desire strongly its members to meet as often as possible and  actively, efficiently and constantly direct, co-ordinate and reinforce the  activities of the individuals and Local Assemblies throughout India and  Burma. I thirst for more specific information and urge its secretary to  ensure that every communication from the Holy Land or from any other  Baha'i centre is promptly and widely distributed. I assure you of my  loving prayers.    March 5, 1925          Unite in Promoting the Work of the Cause      We were sorry to know of the state of tension that exists between India  and Burma. Let us hope that Shoghi Effendi's letter will draw both parties  nearer together and so ease up the matter. It is very sad to see two  sections of such a continent though closely connected together, unable to  work in harmony. Let us pray and also try our best that all petty  misunderstandings should be forgotten and that the work should start on a  new basis firmer than before.    [From the Guardian:]    I do hope and pray that the Indians and Burmese friends will once the new  N.S.A. is elected support their representatives and whole-heartedly unite  in promoting the work of the Cause. An earnest, capable, energetic, loyal  and experienced soul must discharge the responsible and arduous duties of  a National Secretary. So much depends upon him. You will have my fullest  and unqualified support in impressing upon the friends the supreme  necessity of establishing forthwith and maintaining to the best of their  ability the institution of the National Fund. I will pray for you all and  assure you personally of my great affection.    April 1, 1925          Consolidation of the Foundations of the N.S.A.      By now the election of the new National Spiritual Assembly and of its  office-bearers will probably be completed. The office of Secretary of the  National Spiritual Assembly is most important and the smooth and efficient  working of the Baha'i organisation in India and Burmah will depend to a  large extent on him. Shoghi Effendi hopes that the new Secretary of the  National Assembly will send him as soon as possible a full list of the  members and office-bear"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19274"],[0,"Letters from the Guardian to Australia and New Zealand (#3)"],[1,"N.S.A., his hearty congratulations over the success that has attended your  national elections this year. He hopes and prays that as years go by your  Assembly will increasingly grow in unity and strength, and will  demonstrate its capacity to cope with the manifold problems and  difficulties with which it will be inevitably confronted as it forges  ahead in its slow though steady progress towards the firmer establishment  of Baha'u'llah's World Order throughout Australia and New-Zealand.    With regard to your question as to the advisability of disclosing to an  individual believer the contents of the N.S.A.'s correspondence. The  Guardian thinks that although this cannot be considered as constituting an  obligation which a believer can impose upon the national body, yet, it  would seem highly advisable that the N.S.A. should give a sympathetic  consideration to any such request made to it by a believer. This, he  feels, would avoid giving the impression that the assembly is working in  an atmosphere of complete secrecy, and that it is motivated by dictatorial  motives. The final decision in such matters; however, is entirely left to  the discretion of the N.S.A. The basic principle that should always be  remembered is that the N.S.A. cannot be required to reveal to any outsider  all the details concerning its work. It may choose to do so if it wishes,  but nobody has the right to enforce upon it any such action: This is, of  course the purely legal side of the question. But a purely legalistic  attitude in matters affecting the Cause, particularly now that the Faith  is still in a state of infancy, is not only inadequate but fraught with  unforeseen dangers and difficulties. The individuals and assemblies must  learn to cooperate and to cooperate intelligently, if they desire to  adequately discharge their duties and obligations towards the Faith. And  no such cooperation is possible without mutual confidence and trust.    With loving greetings from the Guardian to you and to the members of the  N.S.A. and with the assurance of his prayers on behalf of you all,    Yours in His Service,  H. Rabbani.    [From the Guardian:]    Dear and valued co-worker:    I cannot refrain from expressing in person my deep sense of gratitude and  indebtedness to the beloved co-workers in that land for their splendid  achievements in both the teaching and administrative spheres of Baha'i  activity. I feel truly proud of your accomplishments. I will continue to  supplicate for every one of you the Beloved's imperishable blessings.    Rest assured and persevere.  Shoghi.            LETTER OF SEPTEMBER 26TH, 1935      September 26th, 1935.    Beloved Baha'i co-worker,    On behalf of the Guardian I wish to acknowledge the receipt of your letter  of the 8th of July last, with the enclosed copy of the minutes of the  N.S.A. of the Baha'is of Australia and New-Zealand. I wish, in particular,  to express his gratification at the news of the success of the last  meeting of your N.S.A. held in Sydney. It gives him, indeed, much pleasure  and encouragement to realize that your Assembly meetings are conducted  with such a good deal of order and efficiency, and above all, in such a  perfect spirit of unity and fellowship--the few other obstacles and  difficulties left, he feels confident, will in due time disappear. The  foundation has been now firmly laid down, and the work is bound to develop  and expand. The friends should, therefore, be confident, and should exert  their utmost that the institutions they have so painstakingly and  laboriously established should flourish and yield their fruit.    In connection with the N.S.A.'s decision regarding the appointment of Mrs.  Axford and Mr. Inman to keep records of Australian and New-Zealand  activities for the \"Baha'i World\"; the Guardian wishes you to assure your  fellow-members in the assembly that he fully endorses their choice. He  also wishes you to impress the newly-appointed correspondents with the  vital importance of their task, and to urge them to acquit themselves of  it with thoroughness, efficiency and vigour.    Regarding dear Mr. Hyde Dunn's health; Shoghi Effendi is grieved beyond  words to learn that he is growing so weak physically. Will you kindly  assure him, as well as Mrs. Dunn, of his supplications for the  amelioration of his health and for the complete restoration of his forces.    In closing will you also convey his love and greetings to the members of  the N.S.A. and assure them once more of his continued prayers for their  welfare, protection and guidance,    Yours in His Service,  H. Rabbani.    [From the Guardian:]    Dear and valued co-worker:    The detailed report of the activities of the national assembly--the  furthermost pillar of the Universal House of Justice which the high  endeavours of the believers of Australia and New-Zealand have reared--has  filled my heart and soul with immense joy and gratitude. The Beloved is  surely watching over and continually blessing your splendid  accomplishments, the plans you have conceived, the methods you have  devised, the efforts you are exerting, the services which you have  rendered. I will continue to pray for the consolidation and uninterrupted  expansion of your laudable activities in the service of so glorious and  mighty a Cause. Never relax nor despair. The tender plant which your hands  have raised and nurtured shall grow and will ultimately gather beneath its  shadow the whole of that far-off and promising continent.    Persevere and be happy.  Shoghi.            LETTER OF JANUARY 3RD, 1936      January 3rd, 1936.    The N.S.A. of the Baha'is of Australia and New-Zealand    Dear Baha'i Friends,    Miss Effie Baker is leaving for Australia with the consent and full  approval of the Guardian.    As you know for over ten years she has been devotedly working for the  Cause in Haifa, as keeper of the Western Pilgrim House and also as the  custodian of the International Baha'i Archives. During this long period of  service she has accomplished much for our beloved Cause, and she is now in  need of some rest after so many years of strenuous labours. She is going  to join her mother, and will, it is hoped, prove of great help to the  friends throughout Australia and New-Zealand in both their teaching and  administrative activities.    The Guardian hopes, therefore, that the friends will give her all the  opportunity she needs to help in the extension and consolidation of the  Cause throughout Australia and New-Zealand.    He is entrusting Miss Baker with a beautiful and most precious present for  the friends; it is one of the finest photographs of the Master which, he  wishes your N.S.A. to place in your National Baha'i Archives. He is, in  addition, sending through her for the believers a bottle of attar of rose  extracted by the friends in Persia.    With loving greetings and all good wishes for a most happy and prosperous  New Year.    Yours in His Service,  H. Rabbani.            LETTER OF APRIL 15TH, 1936      April 15th, 1936    Dear Miss Brooks,    On behalf of the Guardian I acknowledge with thanks and appreciation the  receipt of your letter of March 12th with enclosure. He is grateful for  the warm assistance extended by your N.S.A. to Miss Effie Baker, and hopes  that she will be of valuable assistance to you all, specially to the  friends in Melbourne. The task of organizing the believers in that center  is no doubt a very responsible one, and the Guardian trusts that she will  be able to fully acquit herself of it.    Regarding the \"Herald of the South\" magazine, Shoghi Effendi very much  appreciates the fact that in spite of the many difficulties that your  Assembly had to overcome this review is being regularly published, and  that its standard is gradually improving. He would call upon all the  English-speaking friends to contribute, as often as they can, such  articles for publication in that magazine as would serve to make it a more  direct and effective teaching medium for the spread of the Cause  throughout Australia and New-Zealand. He is advising the American N.S.A.  to specially ask the cooperation of the American believers for that  purpose, and hopes that the response they will make to this call will be  such as to further encourage you in your splendid efforts for the  publication of this national organ of the Faith in Australia.    The Guardian would appreciate receiving detailed reports of the activities  of the local assemblies, and would be very thankful if you send these to  him as regularly as you can.    In closing may I ask you to convey his loving greetings to your  distinguished fellow-members in the N.S.A. and to assure each and all of  them of his supplications for their welfare and guidance. He also wishes  you to express his best wishes to dear Father and Mrs. Dunn, and tell them  how happy he is to learn that they are keeping in good health.    Yours in His Service,  H. Rabbani.    [From the Guardian:]    Dear and valued co-worker:    I am so glad to have received your letter and to have realised the  progress of your activities. I trust and pray that the work in which the  National Assembly is so energetically and devotedly engaged may steadily  expand and be further consolidated. The teaching work is the corner-stone  of its activities, the sole basis on which the administrative structure  can flourish. A strenuous, systematic and continuous effort should, both  individually and collectively, be now exerted to attain this supreme  objective. With a heart full of gratitude I will pray for the success of  your endeavours.    Shoghi.            LETTER OF APRIL 26TH, 1936      April 26th, 1936    Beloved Baha'i Sister,    I am directed by the Guardian to thank you for your letter of the 30th  March informing him of the date of Miss Kitty Carpenter's arrival in  Port-Said. You can be sure that the friends will be most delighted to meet  her, and to render her journey to"]]]
