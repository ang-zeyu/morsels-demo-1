And I hope you're learning up a few dates and facts  for this examination. You ought to be studying every morning. If only  Miss Harmon were home, I'd have asked her to coach you. I'm afraid  she'll be disappointed at your leaving, but of course she can't expect  to keep you for ever. I heard a rumor that she means to give up her  school altogether, and go and live with her uncle. I hope it's true, and  then I can take the little ones away with an easy conscience. I don't  want to treat her badly, poor thing, but I'm sure teaching's not her  vocation.\"    Winona really made a heroic effort to prepare herself for the coming  ordeal. She retired to a secluded part of the garden and read over her  latest school books. The process landed her in the depths of  despondency.    \"I'll never remember anything--never!\" she mourned to her family. \"To  try and get all this into my head at once is like bolting a week's meals  at a single go! I know a date here and there, and I've a hazy notion of  French and Latin verbs, and a general impression of other subjects, but  if they ask me for anything definite, such as the battles of the Wars of  the Roses, or a list of the products of India, I'm done for!\"    \"Go in for Post-Impressionism, then,\" suggested Percy. \"Write from a  romantic standpoint, and don't condescend to mere facts. Stick in a  quotation or two, and a drawing if possible, and make your paper sound  eloquent and dramatic and poetical, and all the rest of it. They'll mark  you low for accuracy, but put you on ten per cent. for style, you bet! I  know a chap who tries it on at the Coll., and it always pays.\"    \"It's worth thinking about, certainly,\" said Winona, shutting her books  with a weary yawn.          CHAPTER II    An Entrance Examination      The Seaton High School was a large, handsome brick building exactly  opposite the public park. It had only been erected two years ago, so  everything about it was absolutely new and up-to-date. It supplied a  great need in the rapidly growing city, and indeed offered the best and  most go-ahead education to be obtained in the district.    It was the aim of the school to fit girls for various professions and  careers; there was a classical and a modern side, a department for  domestic economy, and a commercial class for instruction in business  details. Art, music, and nature study were well catered for, and manual  training was not forgotten. As the school was intended to become in time  a center for the county, the Governors had offered two open free  scholarships to be competed for by girls resident in other parts of  Rytonshire, hoping by this means to attract pupils from the country  places round about.    On the morning of September 8th, precisely at 8.35, Winona presented  herself at the school for the scholarship examination. There were twenty  other candidates awaiting the ordeal, in various stages of nervousness  or sangfroid. Some looked dejected, some confident, and others hid their  feelings under a mask of stolidity. Winona joined them shyly. They were  all unknown to one another, and so far nobody had plucked up courage to  venture a remark. It is horribly depressing to sit on a form staring at  twenty taciturn strangers. Winona bore for awhile with the stony  silence, then--rather frightened at the sound of her own voice--she  announced:    \"I suppose we're all going in for this same exam.!\" It was a trite  commonplace, but it broke the ice. Everybody looked relieved. The  atmosphere seemed to clear.    \"Yes, we're all going in--that's right enough,\" replied a ruddy-haired  girl in spectacles, \"but there are only two scholarships, so nineteen of  us are bound to fail--that's logic and mathematics and all the rest of  it.\"    \"Whew! A nice cheering prospect. Wish they'd put us out of our misery at  once!\" groaned a stout girl with a long fair pigtail.    \"I'm all upset!\" shivered another.    \"It's like a game of musical chairs,\" suggested a fourth. \"We're all  scrambling for the same thing, and some are bound to be out of it.\"    The ruddy-haired girl laughed nervously.    \"Suppose we've got to take our sporting luck!\" she murmured.    \"If nineteen are sure to lose, two are sure to win at any rate,\" said  Winona. \"That's logic and mathematics and all the rest of it, too!\"    \"Right you are! That's a more cheering creed! It doesn't do to cry  'Miserere me' too soon!\" chirped a jolly-looking dark-eyed girl with a  red hair-ribbon. \"'Never say die till you're dead,' is my motto!\"    \"I'm wearing a swastika for a mascot,\" said a short, pale girl,  exhibiting her charm, which hung from a chain round her neck. \"I never  am lucky, so I thought I'd try what this would do for me for once. I  know English history beautifully down to the end of Queen Anne, and no  further, and if they set any questions on the Georges I'll be stumped.\"    \"I've learnt Africa, but Asia would floor me!\" observed another, looking  up from a geography book, in which she was making a last desperate  clutch at likely items of knowledge. \"I never can remember which side of  India Madras is on; I get it hopelessly mixed with Bombay.\"    \"I wish to goodness they'd go ahead and begin,\" mourned the owner of the  red hair-ribbon. \"It's this waiting that knocks the spirit out of me.  Patience isn't my pet virtue. I call it cruelty to animals to leave us  on tenter-hooks.\"    Almost as if in answer to her pathetic appeal the door opened, and a  teacher appeared. In a brisk, business-like manner she marshaled the  candidates into line, and conducted them to the door of the  head-mistress' study, where one by one they were admitted for a brief  private interview. Winona's turn came about the middle of the row.    \"Pass in: as quickly as you can, please!\" commanded the teacher,  motioning her onward.    As Winona entered, she gave one hasty comprehensive glance round the  room, taking in a general impression of books, busts and pictures, then  focussed her attention on the figure that sat at the desk. It was only  at a later date that she grasped any details of Miss Bishop's  personality; at that first meeting she realized nothing but the pair of  compelling blue eyes that drew her forward like a magnet.    \"Your name?\"    \"Winona Woodward.\"    \"Age?\"    \"Fifteen.\"    \"Residence?\"    \"Highfield, Ashbourne, near Great Marston.\"    \"How long have you lived in the county of Rytonshire?\"    \"Ever since I was born.\"    Miss Bishop hastily ticked off these replies on a page of her ledger,  and handed Winona a card.    \"This will admit you to the examination room. Remember that instead of  putting your name at the head of your papers, you are to write the  number given you on your card. Any candidate writing her own name will  be disqualified. Next girl!\"    It was all over in two minutes. Winona seemed hardly to have entered the  room before she was out again.    \"Move on, please!\" said the teacher, marshaling the little crowd round  the door. \"Will those who have seen Miss Bishop kindly go along the  corridor.\"    Several girls who had been standing in a knot made a sudden bolt, and  pushed their fellows forward. Somebody jogged Winona's elbow. Her card  slid from her grasp and fell on to the ground. As she bent in the crush  to pick it up, the ruddy-haired girl stooped on a like errand.    \"Dropped mine too! Clumsy, isn't it?\" she laughed. \"Hope we've got our  own! What was your number?\"    \"I hadn't time to look.\"    \"Well, I'm sure mine was eleven, so that's all right. I wish you luck!  Won't we just be glad when it's over, rather!\"    At the further end of the corridor was a door with a notice pinned on to  it. \"Examination for County Scholarships.\" A mistress stood there, and  scrutinized each girl's card as she entered, directing her to a seat in  the room marked with the corresponding number. Winona walked rather  solemnly to the desk labeled 10. The great ordeal was at last about to  begin. She wondered what would be the end of it. Little thrills of  nervousness seemed running down her back like drops from a shower-bath.  Her hands were trembling. With a great effort she pulled herself  together.    \"It's no use funking!\" she thought. \"I'll make as good a shot as I can  at things, and if I fail--well, I shall have plenty of companions in  misfortune, at any rate!\"    A pile of foolscap paper with red-ruled margins, a clean sheet of white  blotting paper, and a penholder with a new nib lay ready. Each of the  other twenty victims was surveying a supply of similar material. On the  blackboard was chalked the word \"Silence.\"    In a dead hush the candidates sat and waited. Exactly on the stroke of  nine Miss Bishop entered and handed a sheaf of printed questions to the  teacher in charge, who distributed them round the room. The subject for  the first hour was arithmetic. Winona read over her paper slowly. She  felt capable of managing it, all except the last two problem sums, which  were outside her experience. She knew it would mainly be a question of  accuracy.    \"I'll work them each twice if I've only time,\" she thought, starting at  number one.    An hour is after all only made up of sixty minutes, and these seemed to  fly with incredible rapidity. The teacher on the platform had sternly  reproved a girl guilty of counting aloud in an agitated whisper,  threatening instant expulsion for a repetition of such an offense, but  with this solitary exception nobody transgressed the rules. All sat  quietly absorbed in their work, and an occasional rustle of paper or  scratch of a pen were the only sounds audible. At precisely five minutes  to ten the deity on the platform sounded a bell, and ordered papers to  be put together. She collected them, handed them to another mistress,  then without any break"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18050"],[0,"The House Fly and How to Suppress It (#3)"],[1,"and a small  match stick placed under the edge of the glass. As the solution  evaporates from the paper more flows out from the glass and thus the  supply is automatically renewed.      FLY SPRAYS.    Sprays designed to destroy or repel house flies fill a certain need in  connection with the house-fly problem. No very satisfactory repellent  substances for this insect have been found which are at the same time  adaptable to general use about the home, or places where foods are  handled. Extracts of pyrethrum flowers are now generally available  commercially, and these give fairly good results in the destruction of  house flies in buildings. Most of the sprays of pyrethrum extract  contain kerosene oil as a carrier, and undoubtedly the kerosene has much  to do with the toxicity of the spray. Such materials are most applicable  to buildings which become infested with flies and which can be readily  closed up at night and the air within thoroughly saturated with the  spray by means of an atomizer. Under such conditions the flies are  rather quickly overcome by the spray and if a sufficient quantity is  used they will not revive.      FLYTRAPS.    Flytraps may be used to advantage in decreasing the number of flies.  Their use has been advocated not only because of the immediate results,  but because of the chances that the flies may be caught before they lay  eggs, and the number of future generations will be reduced greatly.    Many types of flytraps are on the market. As a rule the larger ones are  the more effective. Anyone with a few tools can construct flytraps for a  small part of the price of the ready-made ones. A trap (fig. 8) which is  very effective in catching flies and is easily made, durable, and cheap,  may be made of four barrel hoops, four laths, a few strips of boxing,  and 8 1/2 lineal feet of screening, 24 inches wide. (For greater details  see Farmers' Bulletin 734.)    The effectiveness of the traps will depend on the selection of baits. A  good bait for catching house flies is 1 part of blackstrap molasses to 3  parts of water, after the mixture has been allowed to ferment for a day  or two. Overripe or fermenting bananas crushed and placed in the bait  pans give good results, especially with milk added to them. A mixture of  equal parts brown sugar and curd of sour milk, thoroughly moistened,  gives good results after it has been allowed to stand for three or four  days.          PREVENTING THE BREEDING OF FLIES.      As previously stated, fly papers, poisons, and traps are at best only  temporary expedients. The most logical method of abating the fly  nuisance is the elimination or treatment of all breeding places. It  would appear from what is known of the life history and habits of the  common house fly that it is perfectly feasible for cities and towns to  reduce the numbers of this annoying and dangerous insect so greatly as  to render it of comparatively slight account. On farms also, in dairies,  and under rural conditions generally, much can and should be done to  control the fly, which here, as elsewhere, constitutes a very serious  menace to health.      CONSTRUCTION AND CARE OF STABLES.    In formulating rules for the construction and care of stables and the  disposal of manure the following points must be taken into  consideration. In the first place, the ground of soil-floor stables may  offer a suitable place for the development of fly larvae. The larvae will  migrate from the manure to the soil and continue their growth in the  moist ground. This takes place to some extent even when the manure is  removed from the stables every day. Even wooden floors are not entirely  satisfactory unless they are perfectly water-tight, since larvae will  crawl through the cracks and continue their development in the moist  ground below. Water-tight floors of concrete or masonry, therefore, are  desirable. Flies have been found to breed in surprising numbers in small  accumulations of material in the corners of feed troughs and mangers,  and it is important that such places be kept clean.      FLY-TIGHT MANURE PITS.    The Bureau of Entomology for a number of years has advised that manure  from horse stables be kept in fly-tight pits or bins. Such pits can be  built in or attached to the stable so that manure can be easily thrown  in at the time of cleaning and so constructed that the manure can be  readily removed. It is desirable that the manure be placed in these  fly-proof receptacles as soon as possible after it is voided. The  essential point is that flies be prevented from reaching the manure, and  for this reason the pit or bin must be tightly constructed, preferably  of concrete, and the lid kept closed except when the manure is being  thrown in or removed. The difficulty has been that manure often becomes  infested before it is put into the container, and flies frequently breed  out before it is emptied and often escape through the cracks. To obviate  these difficulties a manure box or pit with a modified tent trap or cone  trap attached is desirable.    In order to retain the fertilizing value of manure to the greatest  extent it is advisable that air be excluded from it as much as possible  and that it be protected from the leaching action of rains. This being  the case, there is really no necessity for covering a large portion of  the top of the box with a trap, but merely to have holes large enough to  attract flies to the light, and to cover these holes with ordinary  conical traps, with the legs cut off, so, that the bottoms of the traps  will fit closely to the box. The same arrangement can be made where  manure is kept in a pit. If manure boxes or pits are kept fly tight they  are satisfactory under farm or dairy conditions for the storage of  manure during the busy season when it can not be hauled out daily.      FREQUENCY WITH WHICH MANURE SHOULD BE REMOVED IN CITIES AND TOWNS.    In deciding the question as to how often manure should be removed in  cities and towns, it should be borne in mind that when the larvae have  finished feeding they will often leave the manure and pupate in the  ground below or crawl some distance away to pupate in debris under  boards or stones and the like. Hence the manure should be removed before  the larvae reach the migratory stage; that is to say, removal is  necessary every three days, and certainly not less frequently than twice  a week during the summer months. A series of orders issued in 1906 by  the health department of the District of Columbia, on the authority of  the Commissioners of the District, covers most of these points, and  these orders, which may well serve as a model to other communities  desiring to undertake similar measures, may be briefly condensed as  follows:         HEALTH OFFICE REGULATIONS FOR CONTROL OF HOUSE FLIES IN CITIES.         All stalls in which animals are kept shall have the surface of the       ground covered with a water-tight floor. Every person occupying a       building where domestic animals are kept shall maintain in       connection therewith a bin or pit for the reception of manure and,       pending the removal from the premises of the manure from the animal       or animals, shall place such manure in said bin or pit. This bin       shall be so constructed as to exclude rain water and shall in all       other respects be water-tight, except as it may be connected with       the public sewer. It shall be provided with a suitable cover and       constructed so as to prevent the ingress and egress of flies. No       person owning a stable shall keep any manure or permit any manure       to be kept in or upon any portion of the premises other than the       bin or pit described, nor shall he allow any such bin or pit to be       overfilled or needlessly uncovered. Horse manure may be kept       tightly rammed into well-covered barrels for the purpose of removal       in such barrels. Every person keeping manure in the more densely       populated parts of the District shall cause all such manure to be       removed from the premises at least twice every week between June 1       and October 31, and at least once every week between November 1 and       May 31 of the following year. No person shall remove or transport       any manure over any public highway in any of the more densely       populated parts of the District except in a tight vehicle, which,       if not inclosed, must be effectually covered with canvas, so as to       prevent the manure from being dropped. No person shall deposit       manure removed from the bins or pits within any of the more densely       populated parts of the District without a permit from the health       officer. Any person violating any of the provisions shall, upon       conviction thereof, be punished by a fine of not more than $40 for       each offense.    Not only must horse stables be cared for, but chicken yards, piggeries,  and garbage receptacles as well. In cities, with better methods of  disposal of garbage and with the lessening of the number of horses and  horse stables consequent upon electric street railways, bicycles, and  automobiles, the time may come, and before very long, when window  screens may be discarded.      DISPOSAL OF MANURE IN RURAL AND SUBURBAN DISTRICTS.    The control of flies in rural and suburban districts offers a much more  difficult problem. Here it is often out of the question to remove all  manure from the premises twice a week, and the problem is to find some  method of disposal or storage which will conserve the fertilizing value  of the manure and at the same time prevent all flies from breeding, or  destroy such as do breed there.    With this idea in mind, it has been recommended that stable manure be  collected every morning and hauled out at once and spread rather thinly  on the fields. This procedure is advisable from the point of view of  getting the maximum fertilizing value from the manure. Immediate  "]]]
