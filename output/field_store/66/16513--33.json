Carvings of small  rodents in similar attitudes are exhibited in Stevens's \"Flint Chips,\"  p. 428, Figs. 61 and 62. Stevens's Fig. 61 evidently represents the same  animal as Fig. 157 of Squier and Davis, but is a better executed  carving.    In illustration of the somewhat vague idea entertained by archaeologists  as to what the manatee is like, it is of interest to note that the  carving of a second otter with a fish in its mouth has been made to do  duty as a manatee, although the latter animal is well known never to eat  fish, but, on the contrary, to be strictly herbivorous. Thus Stevens  gives figures of two carvings in his \"Flint Chips,\" p. 429, Figs. 65 and  66, calling them manatees, and says: \"In one particular, however, the  sculptors of the mound-period committed an error. Although the lamantin  is strictly herbivorous, feeding chiefly upon subaqueous plants and  littoral herbs, yet upon one of the stone smoking-pipes, Fig. 66, this  animal is represented with a fish in its mouth.\" Mr. Stevens apparently  preferred to credit the mound sculptor with gross ignorance of the  habits of the manatee, rather than to abate one jot or tittle of the  claim possessed by the carving to be considered a representation of that  animal. Stevens's fish-catching manatee is the same carving given by Dr.  Rau, in the Archaeological Collection of the United States National  Museum, p. 47, Fig. 180, where it is correctly stated to be an otter.  This cut, which can scarcely be distinguished from one given by Stevens  (Fig. 66), is here reproduced (Fig. 6), together with the second  supposed manatee of the latter writer (Fig. 7).    [Illustration: Fig. 6.--Otter of Rau; Manatee of Stevens.]    [Illustration: Fig. 7.--Manatee of Stevens.]    To afford a means of comparison, Fig. 154, from the \"Ancient Monuments\"  of Squier and Davis, is introduced (Fig. 8). The same figure is also to  be found in Wilson's Prehistoric Man, vol. i, p. 476, Fig. 22. Another  of the supposed lamantins, Fig. 9, is taken from Squier's article in the  Transactions of the American Ethnological Society, vol. ii, p. 188. A  bad print of the same wood-cut appears as Fig. 153, p. 251, of the  \"Ancient Monuments.\"    It should be noted that the physiognomy of Fig. 6, above given, although  unquestionably of an otter, agrees more closely with the several  so-called manatees, which are represented without fishes, than with the  fish-bearing otter, first mentioned, Fig. 4.    Fig. 6 thus serves as a connecting link in the series, uniting the  unmistakable otter, with the fish in its mouth, to the more clumsily  executed and less readily recognized carvings of the same animal.    [Illustration: Fig. 8.--Lamantin or sea-cow of Squier and Davis.]    [Illustration: Fig. 9.--Lamantin or sea-cow of Squier.]    It was doubtless the general resemblance which the several specimens of  the otters and the so-called manatees bear to each other that led  Stevens astray. They are by no means facsimiles one of the other. On the  contrary, while no two are just alike, the differences are perhaps not  greater than is to be expected when it is considered that they doubtless  embody the conceptions of different artists, whose knowledge of the  animal, as well as whose skill in carving, would naturally differ  widely. Recognizing the general likeness, Stevens perhaps felt that what  one was all were. In this, at least, he is probably correct, and the  following reasons are deemed sufficient to show that, whether the  several sculptures figured by one and another author are otters or not,  as here maintained, they most assuredly are not manatees. The most  important character possessed by the sculptures, which is not found in  the manatee, is an external ear. In this particular they all agree. Now,  the manatee has not the slightest trace of a pinna or external ear, a  small orifice, like a slit, representing that organ. To quote the  precise language of Murie in the Proceedings of the London Zoological  Society, vol. 8, p. 188: \"In the absence of pinna, a small orifice, a  line in diameter, into which a probe could be passed, alone represents  the external meatus.\" In the dried museum specimen this slit is wholly  invisible, and even in the live or freshly killed animal it is by no  means readily apparent. Keen observer of natural objects, as savage and  barbaric man certainly is, it is going too far to suppose him capable of  representing an earless animal--earless at least so far as the purposes  of sculpture are concerned--with prominent ears. If, then, it can be  assumed that these sculptures are to be relied upon as in the slightest  degree imitative, it must be admitted that the presence of ears would  alone suffice to show that they cannot have been intended to represent  the manatee. But the feet shown in each and all of them present equally  unquestionable evidence of their dissimilarity from the manatee. This  animal has instead of a short, stout fore leg, terminating in flexible  fingers or paws, as indicated in the several sculptures, a shapeless  paddle-like flipper. The nails with which the flipper terminates are  very small, and if shown at all in carving, which is wholly unlikely, as  being too insignificant, they would be barely indicated and would  present a very different appearance from the distinctly marked digits  common to the several sculptures.    Noticing that one of the carvings has a differently shaped tail from the  others, the authors of the \"Ancient Monuments\" attempt to reconcile the  discrepancy as follows: \"Only one of the sculptures exhibits a flat  truncated tail; the others are round. There is however a variety of the  lamantin (_Manitus Senigalensis_, Desm.) which has a round tail, and is  distinguished as the \"round-tailed manitus.\" (Ancient Monuments, p.  252.) The suggestion thus thrown out means, if it means anything, that  the sculpture exhibiting a flat tail is the only one referable to the  manatee of Florida and southward, the _M. Americanus_, while those with  round tails are to be identified with the so-called \"Round-tailed  Lamantin,\" the _M. Senegalensis_, which lives in the rivers of  Senegambia and along the coast of Western Africa. It is to be regretted  that the above authors did not go further and explain the manner in  which they suppose the Mound-Builders became acquainted with an animal  inhabiting the West African coast. Elastic as has proved to be the  thread upon which hangs the migration theory, it would seem to be hardly  capable of bearing the strain required for it to reach from the  Mississippi Valley to Africa.    Had the authors been better acquainted with the anatomy of the manatees  the above suggestion would never have been made, since the tails of the  two forms are, so far as known, almost exactly alike. A rounded tail is,  in fact, the first requisite of the genus _Manatus_, to which both the  manatees alluded to belong, in distinction from the forked tail of the  genus _Halicore_.    Whether the tails of the sculptured manatees be round or flat matters  little, however, since they bear no resemblance to manatee tails, either  of the round or flat tailed varieties, or, for that matter, to tails of  any sort. In many of the animal carvings the head alone engaged the  sculptor's attention, the body and members being omitted entirely, or  else roughly blocked out; as, for instance, in the case of the squirrel  given above, in which the hind parts are simply rounded off into  convenient shape, with no attempt at their delineation. Somewhat the  same method was evidently followed in the case of the supposed manatees,  only after the pipe cavities had been excavated the block was shaped off  in a manner best suited to serve the purpose of a handle. Without,  however, attempting to institute farther comparisons, two views of a  real manatee are here subjoined, which are fac-similes of Murie's  admirable photo-lithograph in Trans. London Zoological Society, vol. 8,  1872-'74. A very brief comparison of the supposed manatees, with a  modern artistic representation of that animal, will show the  irreconcilable differences between them better than any number of pages  of written criticism.    [Illustration: Fig. 10.--Manatee (_Manatus Americanus_, Cuv.).  Side view.]    [Illustration: Fig. 11.--Manatee (_Manatus Americanus_, Cuv.).  Front view.]    There would seem, then, to be no escape from the conclusion that the  animal sculptures which have passed current as manatees do not really  resemble that animal, which is so extraordinary in all its aspects and  so totally unlike any other of the animal creation as to render its  identification in case it had really served as a subject for sculpture,  easy and certain.    As the several sculptures bear a general likeness to each other and  resemble with considerable closeness the otter, the well known  fish-eating proclivities of this animal being shown in at least two of  them, it seems highly probable that it is the otter that is rudely  portrayed in all these sculptures.    The otter was a common resident of all the region occupied by the  Mound-Builders, and must certainly have been well known to them.  Moreover, the otter is one of the animals which figures largely in the  mythology and folk-lore of the natives of America, and has been adopted  in many tribes as their totem. Hence, this animal would seem to be a  peculiarly apt subject for embodiment in sculptured form. It matters  very little, however, whether these sculptures were intended as otters  or not, the main point in the present connection being that they cannot  have been intended as manatees.    Before leaving the subject of the manatee, attention may be called to a  curious fact in connection with the Cincinnati Tablet, \"of "]]]
