All this I did purposely in a very affable and obliging tone and  manner; for I hold that example is infinitely better than precept, and  always endeavour, if possible, to overcome evil with good.  I offered my  arm to the old woman, who thanked me and took it.    \"What!\" whispered Peterkin, \"you don't mean me to take this great ugly  gorilla in tow?\"    \"Of course,\" replied I, laughing, as I led the way.    Immediately I entered into conversation with my companion, and I heard  \"the gorilla\" attempt to do so with Peterkin; but from the few sharp  cross replies that reached my ear, I became aware that he was  unsuccessful.  In the course of a few minutes, however, he appeared to  have overcome his companion's ill-humour, for I overheard their voices  growing louder and more animated as they walked behind me.    Suddenly I heard a shout, and turning hastily round, observed Peterkin  struggling in the arms of the gorilla!  Amazed beyond measure at the  sight, and firmly persuaded that a cowardly assault had been made upon  my friend, I seized the old woman's umbrella, as the only available  weapon, and flew to the rescue.    \"Jack, my boy! can it be possible?\" gasped Peterkin.    \"I believe it is,\" replied Jack, laughing.--\"Ralph, my dear old fellow,  how are you?\"    I stood petrified.  I believed that I was in a dream.    I know not what occurred during the next five minutes.  All I could  remember with anything like distinctness was a succession of violent  screams from the little old woman, who fled shouting thieves and murder  at the full pitch of her voice.  We never saw that old woman again, but  I made a point of returning her umbrella to the \"white house.\"    Gradually we became collected and sane.    \"Why, Jack, how did you find us out?\" cried Peterkin, as we all hurried  on to my lodgings, totally forgetful of the little old woman, whom, as I  have said, we never saw again, but who, I sincerely trust, arrived at  the white house in safety.    \"Find you out!  I knew you the moment I set eyes on you.  Ralph puzzled  me for a second, he has grown so much stouter; but I should know your  nose, Peterkin, at a mile off.\"    \"Well, Jack, I did not know you,\" retorted Peterkin, \"but I'm safe never  again to forget you.  Such a great hairy Cossack as you have become!  Why, what do you mean by it?\"    \"I couldn't help it, please,\" pleaded Jack; \"I grew in spite of myself;  but I think I've stopped now.\"    \"It's time,\" remarked Peterkin.    Jack had indeed grown to a size that men seldom attain to without losing  in grace infinitely more than they gain in bulk, but he had retained all  the elegance of form and sturdy vigour of action that had characterised  him as a boy.  He was fully six feet two inches in his stockings, but so  perfect were his proportions that his great height did not become  apparent until you came close up to him.  Full half of his handsome  manly face was hid by a bushy black beard and moustache, and his curly  hair had been allowed to grow luxuriantly, so that his whole aspect was  more like to the descriptions we have of one of the old Scandinavian  Vikings than a gentleman of the present time.  In whatever company he  chanced to be he towered high above every one else, and I am satisfied  that, had he walked down Whitechapel, the Horse Guards would have  appeared small beside him, for he possessed not only great length of  limb but immense breadth of chest and shoulders.    During our walk to my lodgings Peterkin hurriedly stated his \"plan and  proposal,\" which caused Jack to laugh very much at first, but in a few  minutes he became grave, and said slowly, \"That will just suit--it will  do exactly.\"    \"What will do exactly?  Do be more explicit, man,\" said Peterkin, with  some impatience.    \"I'll go with you, my boy.\"    \"Will you?\" cried Peterkin, seizing his hand and shaking it violently;  \"I knew you would.  I said it; didn't I, Ralph?  And now we shall be  sure of a gorilla, if there's one in Africa, for I'll use you as a  stalking-horse.\"    \"Indeed!\" exclaimed Jack.    \"Yes; I'll put a bear-skin or some sort of fur on your shoulders, and  tie a lady's boa to you for a tail, and send you into the woods.  The  gorillas will be sure to mistake you for a relative until you get quite  close; then you'll take one pace to the left with the left foot (as the  volunteers say), I'll take one to the front with the right--at fifty  yards, ready--present--bang, and down goes the huge puggy with a bullet  right between its two eyes!  There.  And Ralph's agreed to go too.\"    \"O Peterkin, I've done nothing of the sort.  You _proposed_ it.\"    \"Well, and isn't that the same thing?  I wonder, Ralph that you can give  way to such mean-spirited prevarication.  What?  `It's not  prevarication!'  Don't say that now; you know it is.  Ah! you may laugh,  my boy, but you have promised to go with me and Jack to Africa, and go  you shall.\"    And so, reader, it was ultimately settled, and in the course of two  weeks more we three were on our way to the land of the slave, the black  savage, and the gorilla.        CHAPTER TWO.    LIFE IN THE WILD WOODS.    One night, about five or six weeks after our resolution to go to Africa  on a hunting expedition was formed, I put to myself the question, \"Can  it be possible that we are actually here, in the midst of it?\"    \"Certainly, my boy, in the very thick of it,\" answered Peterkin, in a  tone of voice which made Jack laugh, while I started and exclaimed--    \"Why, Peterkin, how did you come to guess my thoughts?\"    \"Because, Ralph, you have got into a habit of thinking aloud, which may  do very well as long as you have no secrets to keep but it may prove  inconvenient some day, so I warn you in time.\"    Not feeling disposed at that time to enter into a bantering conversation  with my volatile companion, I made no reply, but abandoned myself again  to the pleasing fancies and feelings which were called up by the  singular scene in the midst of which I found myself.    It seemed as if it were but yesterday when we drove about the crowded  streets of London making the necessary purchases for our intended  journey, and now, as I gazed around, every object that met my eye seemed  strange, and wild, and foreign, and romantic.  We three were reclining  round an enormous wood fire in the midst of a great forest, the trees  and plants of which were quite new to me, and totally unlike those of my  native land.  Rich luxuriance of vegetation was the feature that filled  my mind most.  Tall palms surrounded us, throwing their broad leaves  overhead and partially concealing the starlit sky.  Thick tough limbs of  creeping plants and wild vines twisted and twined round everything and  over everything, giving to the woods an appearance of tangled  impenetrability; but the beautiful leaves of some, and the delicate  tendrils of others, half concealed the sturdy limbs of the trees, and  threw over the whole a certain air of wild grace, as might a  semi-transparent and beautiful robe if thrown around the form of a  savage.    The effect of a strong fire in the woods at night is to give to  surrounding space an appearance of ebony blackness, against which dark  ground the gnarled stems and branches and pendent foliage appear as if  traced out in light and lovely colours, which are suffused with a rich  warm tone from the blaze.    We were now in the wilds of Africa, although, as I have said, I found it  difficult to believe the fact.  Jack and I wore loose brown shooting  coats and pantaloons; but we had made up our minds to give up waistcoats  and neckcloths, so that our scarlet flannel shirts with turned-down  collars gave to us quite a picturesque and brigand-like appearance as we  encircled the blaze--Peterkin smoking vigorously, for he had acquired  that bad and very absurd habit at sea.  Jack smoked too, but he was not  so inveterate as Peterkin.    Jack was essentially moderate in his nature.  He did nothing violently  or in a hurry; but this does not imply that he was slow or lazy.  He was  leisurely in disposition, and circumstances seldom required him to be  otherwise.  When Peterkin or I had to lift heavy weights, we were  obliged to exert our utmost strength and agitate our whole frames; but  Jack was so powerful that a comparatively slight effort was all that he  was usually obliged to make.  Again, when we two were in a hurry we  walked quickly, but Jack's long limbs enabled him to keep up with us  without effort.  Nevertheless there were times when he was called upon  to act quickly and with energy.  On those occasions he was as active as  Peterkin himself, but his movements were tremendous.  It was, I may  almost say, awful to behold Jack when acting under powerful excitement.  He was indeed a splendid fellow, and not by any means deserving of the  name of gorilla, which Peterkin had bestowed on him.    But to continue my description of our costume.  We all wore homespun  grey trousers of strong material.  Peterkin and Jack wore leggings in  addition, so that they seemed to have on what are now termed  knickerbockers.  Peterkin, however, had no coat.  He preferred a stout  grey flannel shirt hanging down to his knees and belted round his waist  in the form of a tunic.  Our tastes in headdress were varied.  Jack wore  a pork-pie cap; Peterkin and I had wide-awakes.  My facetious little  companion said that I had selected this species of hat because I was  always more than half asleep!  Being peculiar in everything, Peterkin  wore his wide-awake in an unusual manner--namely, turned up at the back,  down at the front, and curled "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2176"],[0,"Seven Discourses on Art (#3)"],[1,"advancing in his knowledge  of the human figure; and though he seems to superficial observers to make  a slower progress, he will be found at last capable of adding (without  running into capricious wildness) that grace and beauty which is  necessary to be given to his more finished works, and which cannot be got  by the moderns, as it was not acquired by the ancients, but by an  attentive and well-compared study of the human form.    What I think ought to enforce this method is, that it has been the  practice (as may be seen by their drawings) of the great masters in the  art.  I will mention a drawing of Raffaelle, \"The Dispute of the  Sacrament,\" the print of which, by Count Cailus, is in every hand.  It  appears that he made his sketch from one model; and the habit he had of  drawing exactly from the form before him appears by his making all the  figures with the same cap, such as his model then happened to wear; so  servile a copyist was this great man, even at a time when he was allowed  to be at his highest pitch of excellence.    I have seen also academy figures by Annibale Caracci, though he was often  sufficiently licentious in his finished works, drawn with all the  peculiarities of an individual model.    This scrupulous exactness is so contrary to the practice of the  academies, that it is not without great deference that I beg leave to  recommend it to the consideration of the visitors, and submit it to them,  whether the neglect of this method is not one of the reasons why students  so often disappoint expectation, and being more than boys at sixteen,  become less than men at thirty.    In short, the method I recommend can only be detrimental when there are  but few living forms to copy; for then students, by always drawing from  one alone, will by habit be taught to overlook defects, and mistake  deformity for beauty.  But of this there is no danger, since the council  has determined to supply the academy with a variety of subjects; and  indeed those laws which they have drawn up, and which the secretary will  presently read for your confirmation, have in some measure precluded me  from saying more upon this occasion.  Instead, therefore, of offering my  advice, permit me to indulge my wishes, and express my hope, that this  institution may answer the expectations of its royal founder; that the  present age may vie in arts with that of Leo X. and that \"the dignity of  the dying art\" (to make use of an expression of Pliny) may be revived  under the reign of George III.        A DISCOURSE  Delivered to the Students of the Royal Academy, on the Distribution of  the Prizes, December 11, 1769, by the President.      Gentlemen,--I congratulate you on the honour which you have just  received.  I have the highest opinion of your merits, and could wish to  show my sense of them in something which possibly may be more useful to  you than barren praise.  I could wish to lead you into such a course of  study as may render your future progress answerable to your past  improvement; and, whilst I applaud you for what has been done, remind you  of how much yet remains to attain perfection.    I flatter myself, that from the long experience I have had, and the  unceasing assiduity with which I have pursued those studies, in which,  like you, I have been engaged, I shall be acquitted of vanity in offering  some hints to your consideration.  They are indeed in a great degree  founded upon my own mistakes in the same pursuit.  But the history of  errors properly managed often shortens the road to truth.  And although  no method of study that I can offer will of itself conduct to excellence,  yet it may preserve industry from being misapplied.    In speaking to you of the theory of the art, I shall only consider it as  it has a relation to the method of your studies.    Dividing the study of painting into three distinct periods, I shall  address you as having passed through the first of them, which is confined  to the rudiments, including a facility of drawing any object that  presents itself, a tolerable readiness in the management of colours, and  an acquaintance with the most simple and obvious rules of composition.    This first degree of proficiency is, in painting, what grammar is in  literature, a general preparation to whatever species of the art the  student may afterwards choose for his more particular application.  The  power of drawing, modelling, and using colours is very properly called  the language of the art; and in this language, the honours you have just  received prove you to have made no inconsiderable progress.    When the artist is once enabled to express himself with some degree of  correctness, he must then endeavour to collect subjects for expression;  to amass a stock of ideas, to be combined and varied as occasion may  require.  He is now in the second period of study, in which his business  is to learn all that has hitherto been known and done.  Having hitherto  received instructions from a particular master, he is now to consider the  art itself as his master.  He must extend his capacity to more sublime  and general instructions.  Those perfections which lie scattered among  various masters are now united in one general idea, which is henceforth  to regulate his taste and enlarge his imagination.  With a variety of  models thus before him, he will avoid that narrowness and poverty of  conception which attends a bigoted admiration of a single master, and  will cease to follow any favourite where he ceases to excel.  This period  is, however, still a time of subjection and discipline.  Though the  student will not resign himself blindly to any single authority when he  may have the advantage of consulting many, he must still be afraid of  trusting his own judgment, and of deviating into any track where he  cannot find the footsteps of some former master.    The third and last period emancipates the student from subjection to any  authority but what he shall himself judge to be supported by reason.  Confiding now in his own judgment, he will consider and separate those  different principles to which different modes of beauty owe their  original.  In the former period he sought only to know and combine  excellence, wherever it was to be found, into one idea of perfection; in  this he learns, what requires the most attentive survey and the subtle  disquisition, to discriminate perfections that are incompatible with each  other.    He is from this time to regard himself as holding the same rank with  those masters whom he before obeyed as teachers, and as exercising a sort  of sovereignty over those rules which have hitherto restrained him.  Comparing now no longer the performances of art with each other, but  examining the art itself by the standard of nature, he corrects what is  erroneous, supplies what is scanty, and adds by his own observation what  the industry of his predecessors may have yet left wanting to perfection.  Having well established his judgment, and stored his memory, he may now  without fear try the power of his imagination.  The mind that has been  thus disciplined may be indulged in the warmest enthusiasm, and venture  to play on the borders of the wildest extravagance.  The habitual  dignity, which long converse with the greatest minds has imparted to him,  will display itself in all his attempts, and he will stand among his  instructors, not as an imitator, but a rival.    These are the different stages of the art.  But as I now address myself  particularly to those students who have been this day rewarded for their  happy passage through the first period, I can with no propriety suppose  they want any help in the initiatory studies.  My present design is to  direct your view to distant excellence, and to show you the readiest path  that leads to it.  Of this I shall speak with such latitude as may leave  the province of the professor uninvaded, and shall not anticipate those  precepts which it is his business to give and your duty to understand.    It is indisputably evident that a great part of every man's life must be  employed in collecting materials for the exercise of genius.  Invention,  strictly speaking, is little more than a new combination of those images  which have been previously gathered and deposited in the memory.  Nothing  can come of nothing.  He who has laid up no materials can produce no  combinations.    A student unacquainted with the attempts of former adventurers is always  apt to overrate his own abilities, to mistake the most trifling  excursions for discoveries of moment, and every coast new to him for a  new-found country.  If by chance he passes beyond his usual limits, he  congratulates his own arrival at those regions which they who have  steered a better course have long left behind them.    The productions of such minds are seldom distinguished by an air of  originality: they are anticipated in their happiest efforts; and if they  are found to differ in anything from their predecessors, it is only in  irregular sallies and trifling conceits.  The more extensive therefore  your acquaintance is with the works of those who have excelled the more  extensive will be your powers of invention; and what may appear still  more like a paradox, the more original will be your conceptions.  But the  difficulty on this occasion is to determine who ought to be proposed as  models of excellence, and who ought to be considered as the properest  guides.    To a young man just arrived in Italy, many of the present painters of  that country are ready enough to obtrude their precepts, and to offer  their own performances as examples of that perfection which they affect  to recommend.  The modern, however, who recommends _himself_ as a  standard, may justly be suspected as ignorant of the true end, and  unacquainted with the proper object of the art which he professes.  To  follow such a guide will not only retard the student, but mislead him. "]]]
