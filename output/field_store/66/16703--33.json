It was agreed that the vessel should leave the  landing and that a small boat should take the fugitives aboard at  night, as there were Kentucky spies in Sandusky that might apprehend  them. Henson said he watched the vessel leave the landing and then  lower a boat for the shore and in a few minutes his black friend and  two sailors landed and went with him to get his family. Thinking that  he had been captured his wife had grown despondent and had moved from  the spot where he left her. With a little difficulty, he found her,  but when she saw him approaching with those men, she was still more  frightened. She was reassured, however, and soon they were received on  board in the midst of hearty cheers. They arrived at Buffalo the next  evening too late to cross the river. The following morning they were  brought to Burnham and went on the ferry boat to Waterloo. The good  Captain Burnham paid the passage money and gave Henson a dollar  beside. They arrived in Canada on the 28th day of October, 1830.  Describing his exultation Henson said: \"I threw myself on the ground,  rolled in the sand, seized handfuls of it and kissed them, and danced  round till, in the eyes of several who were present, I passed for a  madman. 'He's some crazy fellow,' said a Colonel Warren, who happened  to be there. 'O, no, master! don't you know? I'm free!' He burst into  a shout of laughter. 'Well I never knew freedom make a man roll in the  sand in such a fashion,' Still I could not control myself. I hugged  and kissed my wife and children, and, until the first exuberant burst  of feeling was over, went on as before.\"    He soon found employment there with one Mr. Hibbard, whom he served  three years and was lodged in a cabin better than that in Kentucky.  His family, however, had been so exposed that during the first winter  they almost died of sickness, but his employer was kind to him. Mr.  Hibbard taught Henson's son Tom, then twelve years of age. Tom's  achievements were soon such that instead of reading the Bible to his  father to assist him in preaching he taught his father to read.  Henson then entered the service of one Mr. Risely, who had experienced  more elevation of mind than Mr. Hibbard. With this advantage Henson  not only realized more fully than ever the ignorance in which he  lived, but became interested in the elevation of his people there, who  had been content with the mere making a livelihood rather than solving  the economic problems of freedom. A good many, thereafter, agreed to  invest their savings in land. In this they had the cooperation of Mr.  Risely. Henson set out, therefore, in 1834 to explore the country and  finally selected a place for a settlement to the east of Lake St.  Clair and Detroit river later called Colchester.    Henson thereafter directed his attention to those whom he had left in  bondage. If he felt any compunction of conscience for having conducted  the party of Maryland slaves through a free State without making an  effort to free them, he made up for that in later years. Addressing an  audience of Negroes some years later at Fort Erie, Pennsylvania, he  took occasion to remind them of their duty to assist in the  emancipation of their fellowmen in the South. In the audience was a  young man named James Lightfoot, who had fled from a plantation near  Maysville, Kentucky. Seeing his duty as never before, he approached  Father Henson to arrange for the rescue of his enslaved kinsmen.  Knowing the agony in which he was, Henson undertook the perilous task  of bringing them to Canada. Leaving his family alone he traveled on  foot through New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio into Kentucky. He had  little difficulty in finding the Lightfoots. On presenting them a  small token of the loved one, who, they were told, had gone to the  land of freedom, they exhibited no little excitement. Unfortunately,  however, Lightfoot's parents were so far advanced in years and his  sisters had so many children that they could not travel. As the young  men, who could have gone, were not anxious to be separated from their  loved ones, all declined the invitation to make this effort for  freedom at that time, promising to undertake it a year thereafter, if  Henson returned for them.    Henson agreed to do so and in the meantime went forty or fifty miles  into Bourbon County in the interior of Kentucky in quest of a large  party of Negroes who were said to be ready to escape. After a search  for about a week he discovered that there were about thirty fugitives  collected from various States. With them he started on the return trip  to Canada, traveling by night and resting by day. They contrived to  cross the Ohio river and reached Cincinnati in three days. There they  were assisted and directed to Richmond, Indiana, a settlement of  Quakers, who helped them on their way. After a difficult journey of  two weeks they reached Toledo and took passage for Canada, which they  reached in safety.    Henson then remained on his farm in Canada some months, but when the  appointed time for the delivery of the enslaved kinsmen of James  Lightfoot arrived, he set out again for Kentucky. He passed through  Lancaster, Ohio, where the people were very much excited over a  meteoric shower, thinking that the day of judgment had come. Henson  thought so too, but believing that he was promoting a righteous cause,  he kept on. On arriving at Portsmouth on the Ohio, he narrowly escaped  being detected by Kentuckians in the town. He resorted to the  stratagem of binding his head with dried leaves in a cloth and  pretended to be so seriously afflicted that he could not speak.  Arriving at Maysville, he had little difficulty in finding the slaves  whom he was seeking. The second person whom he met was Jefferson  Lightfoot, the brother of James Lightfoot for whom Henson was making  this trip. Saturday night, as usual, was set as the time for the  execution of this affair, for the reason that they would not be missed  until Monday and would, therefore, have a day ahead. They started from  Maysville in a boat, hoping to reach Cincinnati before daylight, but  the boat sprang a leak and the party narrowly escaped being drowned.  They procured another boat, however, and got within ten miles of  Cincinnati before daylight. To avoid being detected, they abandoned  the boat and proceeded to walk to Cincinnati, but faced another  difficulty when they reached the Miami, which at that point was too  deep to be forded. But in going up the river seeking a shallow place  they were seemingly led providentially by a cow that waded across  before them. As the weather was cold and they were in a state of  perspiration on wading through, the youngest Lightfoot was seized with  serious contractions, but recovered after receiving such ministrations  as could be given on the way. They were assisted in Cincinnati and the  next day started on their journey to Canada. They had not gone far  before the young Lightfoot became so seriously ill that he had to be  carried on a litter, and this became so irksome that he himself begged  to be left in the wilderness to die alone rather than handicap the  whole party with such good prospects for freedom. With considerable  reluctance, they acceded to his request, and sad indeed was the  parting. But before they had gone more than two miles on their journey  one of the brothers of the sick man suddenly decided to return, as he  could not suffer to have his brother die thus in the wilderness, and  be devoured by wolves. They returned and found the young man seemingly  in a dying condition. They at once decided to resume their journey and  had not gone far before they saw a Quaker whose _thee_ and _thou_ led  them to believe that he was their friend. They then told him their  story, which was sufficient. He immediately returned home, taking them  with him. The fugitives remained there for the night and arranged for  the boy to remain with the Quaker until he should recover. They were  then provided with a sack of biscuit and a supply of meat, with which  they set out again for Canada. After proceeding a little further they  met a white man, who became helpful to them in escaping the slave  hunters who were then on their trail. This man while working for an  employer who undertook to punish him had used violence and had to run  off. The party, knowing the increasing danger of capture, walked all  night, trying to cover the distance of forty miles. At daybreak they  reached a wayside tavern near Lake Erie and ordered breakfast. While  the meal was in preparation they quickly fell asleep. Just as the  breakfast was ready, however, Henson had the peculiar presentiment  that some danger was near and that he should at once leave the house.  After experiencing some difficulty in persuading the fugitives to  leave the tavern quickly they agreed to follow his orders. They had  hardly left the tavern when they heard the tramping of the horses of  the slave hunters. They hid themselves in some bushes nearby which  overlooked the road. The Lightfoots quickly recognized the slave  hunters and whispered their names to Henson as they passed by. This  was the critical moment of their lives. Had they remained in the house  a few minutes longer they would have been apprehended. Their white  friend proceeded to the door in advance of the landlord and when asked  as to whether he had seen any slaves said that he had, that there were  six of them and that they had gone toward Detroit. The slave-hunters  at once set out in that direction. The fugitives returned to the  house, devoured their breakfast immediately and secured the assistance  of the landlord, who hearing their piteous story agreed to take them  in his boat to Canada. In the language of Henson, \"Their bosoms were  swelling with inexpressible joy as they mounted the seats of the boat,  ready, eager, to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20907"],[0,"The Best of the World's Classics,  Restricted to prose. Volume I (of X) - Greece (#3)"],[1,"golden embroidery, as Macaulay says, and  in the touching and beautiful simplicity of Bunyan's childlike  sentences. Thence we pass to the eighteenth century, when English  prose was freed from its involutions and irregularities and brought to  uniformity and to a standard. The age of Anne gave to English prose  balance, precision and settled form. There have been periods of  greater originality, but the eighteenth century at least lived up to  Pope's doctrine, set forth in the familiar line:        \"What oft was thought but ne'er so well exprest.\"    As there is no better period to turn to for instruction than the age  of Anne, so, if we must choose a single writer there is no better  master to be studied than Swift. There have been many great writers  and many fine and beautiful styles since the days of the terrible Dean  of St. Patrick's, from the imposing and finely balanced sentences of  Gibbon to the subtle delicacy of Hawthorne and the careful finish of  Robert Louis Stevenson. But in Swift better than in any one writer can  we find the lessons which are so sorely needed now. He had in the  highest degree force, clearness and concentration all combined with a  marvelous simplicity. Swift's style may have lacked richness, but it  never failed in taste. There is not a line of false fine-writing in  all his books. Those are the qualities which are so needed now,  simplicity and clearness and a scrupulous avoidance of that would-be  fine writing which is not at all fine but merely vulgar and insincere.    The writing in our newspapers is where reform is particularly needed.  There are great journals here and there which maintain throughout a  careful standard of good and sober English. Most of them, unhappily,  are filled in the news columns at least with a strange jargon found  nowhere else, spoken by no one and never used in daily life by those  who every night furnish it to the compositors. It is happily  compounded in about equal parts of turgid fine writing, vulgar  jauntiness and indiscriminate slang.    I can best show my meaning by example. A writer in a newspaper wished  to state that a man who had once caused excitement by a book of  temporary interest and who, after the days of his notoriety were over,  lived a long and checkered career, had killed himself. This is the way  he said it:         His life's work void of fruition and dissipated into       emptiness, his fondest hopes and ambitions crumbled and       scattered, shunned as a fanatic, and unable to longer wage       life's battle, Hinton Rowan Helper, at one time United       States consul general to Buenos Ayres, yesterday sought the       darkest egress from his woes and disappointments--a       suicide's death.         In an unpretentious lodging-house in Pennsylvania avenue,       near the Capitol, the man who as much, if not more than any       other agitator, is said to have blazed the way to the Civil       War, the writer who stirred this nation to its core by his       anti-slavery philippics, and the promoter with the most       gigantic railroad enterprise projected in the history of the       world, was found gript in the icy hand of death. The brain       which gave birth to his historic writings had willed the       stilling of the heart which for three-quarters of a century       had palpitated quick and high with roseate hopes.    That passage, taken at hazard from a newspaper, is intended, I think,  to be fine writing of an imposing and dramatic kind. Why could not  the writer have written it, a little more carefully perhaps, but still  in just the language which he would have used naturally in describing  the event to his wife or friend? Simply stated, it would have been far  more solemn and impressive than this turgid, insincere account with  its large words, its forced note of tragedy and its split infinitive.  Let me put beneath it another description of a death-bed:         The blood and spirits of Le Fevre, which were waxing cold       and slow, and were retreating to their last citadel, the       heart--rallied back,--the film forsook his eyes for a       moment,--he looked up wishfully into my Uncle Toby's       face,--then cast a look upon his boy,--and that ligament,       fine as it was,--was never broken.         Nature instantly ebbed again,--the film returned to its       place,--the pulse fluttered,--stopt,--went       on,--throbbed,--stopt again,--moved,--stopt,--shall I go on?       No.    This famous passage is neither unintentional sentiment nor unaffected  pathos. The art is apparent even in the punctuation. The writer meant  to be touching and pathetic and to awaken emotions of tenderness and  pity and he succeeded. The description is all he meant it to be. The  extract from the newspaper arouses no emotion, unless it be  resentment at its form and leaves us cold and unmoved. The other is  touching and pitiful. Observe the manner in which Sterne obtains his  effect, the perfect simplicity and good taste of every word, the  reserve, the gentleness, the utter absence of any straining for  effect. The one description died the day it appeared. The other has  held its place for a century and a half. Are not the qualities which  produced such a result worth striving for?    Let me take another haphazard selection from a description of a young  girl entitled as such to every one's kindness, courtesy and respect.  In it occurs this sentence: \"The college girl is grammatical in  speech, but she has the jolliest, chummiest jargon of slang that ever  rolled from under a pink tongue.\" That articulate sounds come from  beneath the tongue is at least novel and few persons are fortunate  enough to be able to talk with that portion of their mouths. But I  have no desire to dwell either upon the anatomical peculiarities of  the sentence or upon its abysmal vulgarity. It is supposed to be  effective, it is what is appropriately called \"breezy,\" it is a form  of words which can be heard nowhere in the speech of men and women.  Why should it be consigned to print? It is possible to describe a  young girl attractively and effectively in much simpler fashion. Let  me give an example, not a famous passage at all, from another writer:         She shocked no canon of taste; she was admirably in keeping       with herself, and never jarred against surrounding       circumstances. Her figure, to be sure--so small as to be       almost childlike and so elastic that motion seemed as easy       or easier to it than rest--would hardly have suited one's       idea of a countess. Neither did her face--with brown       ringlets on either side and a slightly piquant nose, and the       wholesome bloom, and the clear shade of tan, and the half       dozen freckles, friendly remembrancers of the April sun and       breeze--precisely give us the right to call her beautiful.       But there was both luster and depth in her eyes. She was       very pretty; as graceful as a bird and graceful much in the       same way; as pleasant about the house as a gleam of sunshine       falling on the floor through a shadow of twinkling leaves,       or as a ray of firelight that dances on the wall while       evening is drawing nigh.    Contrast this with the newspaper sentence and the sensation is one of  pain. Again I say, observe the method by which Hawthorne gets his  effect, the simplicity of the language, the balance of the sentences,  the reserve, the refinement, and the final imaginative touch in the  charming comparison with which the passage ends.    To blame the hard working men who write for the day which is passing  over them because they do not write like Sterne and Hawthorne would be  as absurd as it would be unjust. But they ought to recognize the  qualities of fine English prose, they ought to remember that they can  improve their readers by giving them good, simple English, pure and  undefiled, and they ought not to debauch the public taste by vulgar  fine writing and even more vulgar light writing. In short, they ought  to write for the public as they would talk to their wives and children  and friends; a little more formally and carefully perhaps, but in the  same simple and direct fashion.    For the prolific authors of the flood of stories, which every month  bears on its broad bosom many tons of advertisements, no such  allowance need be made. They are not compelled to furnish copy between  daylight and dark. They need a course of study in English prose more  than anyone else, and they would profit by the effort. As a class  they seem to be like the young man in Du Maurier's picture, who, being  asked if he had read Thackeray, replies, \"No. I nevah read novels; I  write them.\"    In this age of quickening movement and restless haste it is, above all  things, important to struggle against the well-nigh universal  inclination to abandon all efforts for form and style. They are the  great preservers of what is best in literature, the salt which ought  never to lose its savor. Those who use English in public speech and  public writing have a serious responsibility too generally forgotten  and disregarded. I would fain call attention to it altho no single man  can hope to effect much by any plea he can make in behalf of the use  of good English, whether written or spoken. Yet no one, I think, can  read the great masterpieces of English prose and not have both lesson  and responsibility brought home to him. He would be insensible,  indeed, if he did not feel after such reading that he was a sharer in  a noble heritage which it behooved him to guard and cherish. If this  series serves no other purpose, it will exhibit to those who read it  some of the splendors and the beauties of English prose. It will at  least open the gates of literature and perhaps lead its readers to  authors they have not known before, or recall the words of writers who  have entered into their lives and thoughts and thus make them more  mindful of the"]]]
