[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18458"],[0,"Star Born (#3)"],[1," he caught Sssuri's added  puzzlement.    \"Danger--\" The merman's verdict fed his own unease.    Danger had crossed the night, from east to west. And to the west lay  what they had always feared. What was going to happen now?          2    PLANETFALL      Raf Kurbi, flitter pilot and techneer, lay on the padded shock cushion  of his assigned bunk and stared with wide, disillusioned eyes at the  stretch of stark, gray metal directly overhead. He tried to close his  ears to the mutter of meaningless words coming from across the narrow  cabin. Raf had known from the moment his name had been drawn as crew  member that the whole trip would be a gamble, a wild gamble with the  odds all against them. _RS 10_--those very numbers on the nose of the  ship told part of the story. Ten exploring fingers thrust in turn out  into the blackness of space. _RS 3_'s fate was known--she had  blossomed into a pinpoint of flame within the orbit of Mars. And _RS  7_ had clearly gone out of control while instruments on Terra could  still pick up her broadcasts. Of the rest--well, none had returned.    But the ships were built, manned by lot from the trainees, and sent  out, one every five years, with all that had been learned from the  previous job, each refinement the engineers could discover  incorporated into the latest to rise from the launching cradle.    _RS 10_--Raf closed his eyes with weary distaste. After months of  being trapped inside her ever-vibrating shell, he felt that he knew  each and every rivet, seam, and plate in her only too well. And there  was no reason yet to believe that the voyage would ever end. They  would just go on and on through empty space until dead men manned a  drifting hulk--    There--to picture that was a danger signal. Whenever his thoughts  reached that particular point, Raf tried to think of something else,  to break the chain of dismal foreboding. How? By joining in Wonstead's  monologue of complaint and regret? Raf had heard the same words over  and over so often that they no longer had any meaning--except as a  series of sounds he might miss if the man who shared this pocket were  suddenly stricken dumb.    \"Should never have put in for training--\" Wonstead's whine went up the  scale.    That was unoriginal enough. They had all had that idea the minute  after the sorter had plucked their names for crew inclusion. No matter  what motive had led them into the stiff course of training--the  fabulous pay, a real interest in the project, the exploring fever--Raf  did not believe that there was a single man whose heart had not sunk  when he had been selected for flight. Even he, who had dreamed all his  life of the stars and the wonders which might lie just beyond the big  jump, had been honestly sick on the day he had shouldered his bag  aboard and had first taken his place on this mat and waited, dry  mouthed and shivering, for blast-off.    One lost all sense of time out here. They ate sparingly, slept when  they could, tried to while away the endless hours artificially divided  into set periods. But still weeks might be months, or months weeks.  They could have been years in space--or only days. All they knew was  the unending monotony which dragged upon a man until he either lapsed  into a dreamy rejection of his surroundings, as had Hamp and Floy, or  flew into murderous rages, such as kept Morris in solitary confinement  at present. And no foreseeable end to the flight--    Raf breathed shallowly. The air was stale, he could almost taste it.  It was difficult now to remember being in the open air under a sky,  with fresh winds blowing about one. He tried to picture on that dull  strip of metal overhead a stretch of green grass, a tree, even the  blue sky and floating white clouds. But the patch remained stubbornly  gray, the murmur of Wonstead went on and on, a drone in his aching  ears, the throb of the ship's life beat through his own thin body.    What had it been like on those legendary early flights, when the  secret of the overdrive had not yet been discovered, when any who  dared the path between star and star had surrendered to sleep, perhaps  to wake again generations later, perhaps never to rouse again? He had  seen the few documents discovered four or five hundred years ago in  the raided headquarters of the scientific outlaws who had fled the  regimented world government of Pax and dared space on the single hope  of surviving such a journey in cold sleep, the secret of which had  been lost. At least, Raf thought, they had escaped the actual  discomfort of the voyage.    Had they found their new world or worlds? The end of their ventures  had been debated thousands of times since those documents had been  made public, after the downfall of Pax and the coming into power of  the Federation of Free Men.    In fact it was the publication of the papers which had given the  additional spur to the building of the _RS_ armada. What man had dared  once he could dare anew. And the pursuit of knowledge which had been  so long forbidden under Pax was heady excitement for the world.  Research and discovery became feverish avenues of endeavor. Even the  slim hope of a successful star voyage and the return to Terra with  such rich spoils of information was enough to harness three quarters  of the planet's energy for close to a hundred years. And if the _RS  10_ was not successful, there would be _11_, _12_, more--flaming into  the sky and out into the void, unless some newer and more intriguing  experiment developed to center public imagination in another  direction.    Raf's eyes closed wearily. Soon the gong would sound and this period  of rest would be officially ended. But it was hardly worth rising. He  was not in the least hungry for the concentrated food. He could repeat  the information tapes they carried dull word for dull word.    \"Nothing to see--nothing but these blasted walls!\" Again Wonstead's  voice arose in querulous protest.    Yes, while in overdrive there was nothing to see. The ports of the  ship would be sealed until they were in normal space once more. That  is, if it worked and they were not caught up forever within this thick  trap where there was no time, light, or distance.    The gong sounded, but Raf made no move to rise. He heard Wonstead  move, saw from the corner of his eye the other's bulk heave up  obediently from the pad.    \"Hey--mess gong!\" He pointed out the obvious to Raf.    With a sigh the other levered himself up on his elbows. If he did not  move, Wonstead was capable of reporting him to the captain for strange  behavior, and they were all too alert to a divagation which might mean  trouble. He had no desire to end in confinement with Morris.    \"I'm coming,\" Raf said sullenly. But he remained sitting on the edge  of the pad until Wonstead left the cabin, and he followed as slowly as  he could.    So he was not with the others when a new sound tore through the  constant vibrating hum which filled the narrow corridors of the ship.  Raf stiffened, the icy touch of fear tensing his muscles. Was that the  red alarm of disaster?    His eyes went to the light at the end of the short passage. But no  blink of warning red shown there. Not danger--then what--?    It took him a full moment to realize what he had heard, not the signal  of doom, but the sound which was to herald the accomplishment of their  mission--the sound which unconsciously they had all given up any hope  of ever hearing. They had made it!    The pilot leaned weakly against the wall, and his eyes smarted, his  hands were trembling. In that moment he knew that he had never really,  honestly, believed that they would succeed. But they had! _RS 10_ had  reached the stars!    \"Strap down for turnout--strap down for turnout--!\" The disembodied  voice screaming through the ship's speecher was that of Captain  Hobart, but it was almost unrecognizable with emotion. Raf turned and  stumbled back to his cabin, staggered to throw himself once more on  his pad as he fumbled with the straps he must buckle over him.    He heard rather than saw Wonstead blunder in to follow his example,  and for the first time in months the other was dumb, not uttering a  word as he stowed away for the breakthrough which should take them  back into normal space and the star worlds. Raf tore a nail on a  fastening, muttered.    \"Condition red--condition red--Strap down for breakthrough--\" Hobart  chanted at them from the walls. \"One, two, three\"--the count swung on  numeral by numeral; then--\"ten--Stand by--\"    Raf had forgotten what breakthrough was like. He had gone through it  the first time when still under take-off sedation. But this was worse  than he remembered, so much worse. He tried to scream out his protest  against the torture which twisted mind and body, but he could not  utter even a weak cry. This, this was unbearable--a man could go mad  or die--die--die....    He aroused with the flat sweetness of blood on his tongue, a splitting  pain behind the eyes he tried to focus on the too familiar scrap of  wall. A voice boomed, receded, and boomed again, filling the air and  at last making sense, in it a ring of wild triumph!    \"Made it! This is it, men, we've made it; Sol-class sun--three  planets. We'll set an orbit in--\"    Raf licked his lips. It was still too much to swallow in one mental  gulp. So, they had made it--half of their venture was accomplished.  They had broken out of their own solar system, made the big jump, and  before them lay the unknown. Now it was within their reach.    \"D'you hear that, kid?\" demanded Wonstead, his voice no longer an  accusing whine, more steady than Raf ever remembered hearing it. \"We  got through! We'll hit dirt again! Dirt--\" his words trailed away as  if he were sinking into some blissful daydream.    There was a different feeling to the ship herself.
