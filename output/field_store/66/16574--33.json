There was a confused patch, trailing  off to the west; then this became indistinct, and was finally lost,  upon the hard ground outside the group.    For perhaps a minute, or more, we ran about from tree to tree, and  from bush to bush, searching like hounds for a scent, and fearful of  what we might find. We found nothing; and fully in the moonlight we  stood facing one another. The night was profoundly still.    Nayland Smith stepped back into the shadows, and began slowly to turn  his head from left to right, taking in the entire visible expanse of  the common. Towards a point where the road bisected it he stared  intently. Then, with a bound, he set off!    \"Come on, Petrie!\" he cried. \"There they are!\"    Vaulting a railing he went away over a field like a madman. Recovering  from the shock of surprise, I followed him, but he was well ahead of  me, and making for some vaguely seen objects moving against the lights  of the roadway.    Another railing was vaulted, and the corner of a second, triangular  grass patch crossed at a hot sprint. We were twenty yards from the  road when the sound of a starting motor broke the silence. We gained  the gravelled footpath only to see the tail-light of the car dwindling  to the north!    Smith leant dizzily against a tree.    \"Eltham is in that car!\" he gasped. \"Just God! are we to stand here  and see him taken away to--?\"    He beat his fist upon the tree, in a sort of tragic despair. The  nearest cab-rank was no great distance away, but, excluding the  possibility of no cab being there, it might, for all practicable  purposes, as well have been a mile off.    The beat of the retreating motor was scarcely audible; the lights  might but just be distinguished. Then, coming in an opposite  direction, appeared the headlamp of another car, of a car that raced  nearer and nearer to us, so that, within a few seconds of its first  appearance, we found ourselves bathed in the beam of its headlights.    Smith bounded out into the road, and stood, a weird silhouette, with  upraised arms, fully in its course!    The brakes were applied hurriedly. It was a big limousine, and its  driver swerved perilously in avoiding Smith and nearly ran into me.  But, the breathless moment past, the car was pulled up, head on to the  railings; and a man in evening clothes was demanding excitedly what  had happened. Smith, a hatless, dishevelled figure, stepped up to the  door.    \"My name is Nayland Smith,\" he said rapidly--\"Burmese Commissioner.\"  He snatched a letter from his pocket and thrust it into the hands of  the bewildered man. \"Read that. It is signed by another  Commissioner--the Commissioner of Police.\"    With amazement written all over him, the other obeyed.    \"You see,\" continued my friend tersely, \"it is _carte blanche_. I wish  to commandeer your car, sir, on a matter of life and death!\"    The other returned the letter.    \"Allow me to offer it!\" he said, descending. \"My man will take your  orders. I can finish my journey by cab. I am--\"    But Smith did not wait to learn whom he might be.    \"Quick!\" he cried to the stupefied chauffeur. \"You passed a car a  minute ago--yonder. Can you overtake it?\"    \"I can try, sir, if I don't lose her track.\"    Smith leapt in, pulling me after him.    \"Do it!\" he snapped. \"There are no speed limits for me. Thanks! Good  night, sir!\"    We were off! The car swung around and the chase commenced.    One last glimpse I had of the man we had dispossessed, standing alone  by the roadside, and at ever-increasing speed, we leapt away in the  track of Eltham's captors.    Smith was too highly excited for ordinary conversation, but he threw  out short, staccato remarks.    \"I have followed Fu-Manchu from Hong-Kong,\" he jerked. \"Lost him at  Suez. He got here a boat ahead of me. Eltham has been corresponding  with some mandarin up-country. Knew that. Came straight to you. Only  got in this evening. He--Fu-Manchu--has been sent here to get Eltham.  My God! and he has him! He will question him! The interior of China--a  seething pot, Petrie! They had to stop the leakage of information.  _He_ is here for that.\"    The car pulled up with a jerk that pitched me out of my seat, and the  chauffeur leapt to the road and ran ahead. Smith was out in a trice,  as the man, who had run up to a constable, came racing back.    \"Jump in, sir--jump in!\" he cried, his eyes bright with the lust of  the chase; \"they are making for Battersea!\"    And we were off again.    Through the empty streets we roared on. A place of gasometers and  desolate waste lots slipped behind and we were in a narrow way where  gates of yards and a few lowly houses faced upon a prospect of high  blank wall.    \"Thames on our right,\" said Smith, peering ahead. \"His rathole is by  the river as usual. _Hi_!\"--he grabbed up the speaking-tube--\"Stop!  Stop!\"    The limousine swung into the narrow sidewalk, and pulled up close by a  yard gate. I, too, had seen our quarry--a long, low-bodied car,  showing no inside lights. It had turned the next corner, where a  street lamp shone greenly not a hundred yards ahead.    Smith leapt out, and I followed him.    \"That must be a cul-de-sac,\" he said, and turned to the eager-eyed  chauffeur. \"Run back to that last turning,\" he ordered, \"and wait  there, out of sight. Bring the car up when you hear a police-whistle.\"    The man looked disappointed, but did not question the order. As he  began to back away, Smith grasped me by the arm and drew me forward.    \"We must get to that corner,\" he said, \"and see where the car stands,  without showing ourselves.\"          CHAPTER III    THE WIRE JACKET      I suppose we were not more than a dozen paces from the lamp when we  heard the thudding of the motor. The car was backing out!    It was a desperate moment, for it seemed that we could not fail to be  discovered. Nayland Smith began to look about him, feverishly, for a  hiding place, a quest which I seconded with equal anxiety. And Fate  was kind to us--doubly kind as after events revealed. A wooden gate  broke the expanse of wall hard by upon the right, and, as the result  of some recent accident, a ragged gap had been torn in the panels  close to the top.    The chain of the padlock hung loosely; and in a second Smith was up,  with his foot in this as in a stirrup. He threw his arm over the top  and drew himself upright. A second later he was astride the broken  gate.    \"Up you come, Petrie!\" he said, and reached down his hand to aid me.    I got my foot into the loop of chain, grasped at a projection in the  gate-post, and found myself up.    \"There is a crossbar, on this side to stand on,\" said Smith.    He climbed over and vanished in the darkness. I was still astride the  broken gate when the car turned the corner, slowly, for there was  scanty room; but I was standing upon the bar on the inside and had my  head below the gap ere the driver could possibly have seen me.    \"Stay where you are until he passes,\" hissed my companion, below.  \"There is a row of kegs under you.\"    The sound of the motor passing outside grew loud--louder--then began  to die away. I felt about with my left foot, discerned the top of a  keg, and dropped, panting, beside Smith.    \"Phew!\" I said--\"that was a close thing! Smith--how do we know--?\"    \"That we have followed the right car?\" he interrupted. \"Ask yourself  the question: what would any ordinary man be doing motoring in a place  like this at two o'clock in the morning?\"    \"You are right, Smith,\" I agreed. \"Shall we get out again?\"    \"Not yet. I have an idea. Look yonder.\"    He grasped my arm, turning me in the desired direction.    Beyond a great expanse of unbroken darkness a ray of moonlight slanted  into the place wherein we stood, spilling its cold radiance upon rows  of kegs.    \"That's another door,\" continued my friend. I now began dimly to  perceive him beside me. \"If my calculations are not entirely wrong, it  opens on a wharf gate--\"    A steam siren hooted dismally, apparently from quite close at hand.    \"I'm right!\" snapped Smith. \"That turning leads down to the gate. Come  on, Petrie!\"    He directed the light of the electric torch upon a narrow path through  the ranks of casks, and led the way to the farther door. A good two  feet of moonlight showed along the top. I heard Smith straining;  then--    \"These kegs are all loaded with grease,\" he said, \"and I want to  reconnoitre over that door.\"    \"I am leaning on a crate which seems easy to move,\" I reported. \"Yes,  it's empty. Lend a hand.\"    We grasped the empty crate, and, between us, set it up on a solid  pedestal of casks. Then Smith mounted to this observation platform and  I scrambled up beside him, and looked down upon the lane outside.    It terminated as Smith had foreseen at a wharf gate some six feet to  the right of our post. Piled up in the lane beneath us, against the  warehouse door, was a stack of empty casks. Beyond, over the way, was  a kind of ramshackle building that had possibly been a dwelling-house  at some time. Bills were stuck in the ground-floor windows indicating  that the three floors were to let as offices; so much was discernible  in that reflected moonlight.    I could hear the tide lapping upon the wharf, could feel the chill  from the near river and hear the vague noises which, night nor day,  never cease upon the great commercial waterway.    \"Down!\" whispered Smith. \"Make no noise! I suspected it. They heard  the car following!\"    I obeyed, clutching at him for support; for I was suddenly dizzy, and  my heart was leaping wildly--furiously.    \"You saw her?\" he whispered.    Saw her! Yes, I had seen her! And my poor dream-world was toppling  about me, its cities ashes and its fairness dust.    Peering from the window, her great eyes wondrous in the moonlight and  her red lips parted, hair gleaming like burnished foam and her anxious  gaze set upon the corner of the lane--w"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19145"],[0,"The Time Traders (#3)"],[1,"to Ross.    The stranger was oddly dressed--too lightly dressed if one judged the  climate by the frequent snow patches and the biting cold. A strip of  coarse cloth, extending from his armpit to about four inches above the  knee, was wound about his body and pulled in at the waist by a belt. The  belt, far more ornate than the cumbersome wrapping, was made of many  small chains linking metal plates and supported a long dagger which  hung straight in front. The man also wore a round blue cloak, now swept  back on his shoulders to free his bare arms, which was fastened by a  large pin under his chin. His footgear, which extended above his calves,  was made of animal hide, still bearing patches of shaggy hair. His face  was beardless, though a shadowy line along his chin suggested that he  had not shaved that particular day. A fur cap concealed most of his  dark-brown hair.    Was he an Indian? No, for although his skin was tanned, it was as fair  as Ross's under that weathering. And his clothing did not resemble any  Indian apparel Ross had ever seen. Yet, in spite of his primitive  trappings, the man had such an aura of authority, of self-confidence,  and competence that it was clear he was top dog in his own section of  the world.    Soon another man, dressed much like the first, but with a rust-brown  cloak, came along, pulling behind him two very reluctant donkeys, whose  eyes rolled fearfully at sight of the dead wolf. Both animals wore packs  lashed on their backs by ropes of twisted hide. Then another man came  along, with another brace of donkeys. Finally, a fourth man, wearing  skins for covering and with a mat of beard on his cheeks and chin,  appeared. His uncovered head, a bush of uncombed flaxen hair, shone  whitish as he knelt beside the dead beast, a knife with a dull-gray  blade in his hand, and set to work skinning the wolf with appreciable  skill. Three more pairs of donkeys, all heavily laden, were led past the  scene before he finished his task. Finally, he rolled the bloody skin  into a bundle and gave the flayed body a kick before he ran lightly  after the disappearing train of pack animals.          CHAPTER 2      Ross, absorbed in the scene before him, was not prepared for the sudden  and complete darkness which blotted out not only the action but the  light in his own room as well.    \"What--?\" His startled voice rang loudly in his ears, too loudly, for  all sound had been wiped out with the light. The faint swish of the  ventilating system, of which he had not been actively aware until it had  disappeared, was also missing. A trace of the same panic he had known in  the cockpit of the atomjet tingled along his nerves. But this time he  could meet the unknown with action.    Ross slowly moved through the dark, his hands outstretched before him to  ward off contact with the wall. He was determined that somehow he would  discover the hidden door, escape from this dark cell....    There! His palm struck flat against a smooth surface. He swept out his  hand--and suddenly it passed over emptiness. Ross explored by touch.  There _was_ a door and now it was open. For a moment he hesitated, upset  by a nagging little fear that if he stepped through he would be out on  the hillside with the wolves.    \"That's stupid!\" Again he spoke aloud. And, just because he did feel  uneasy, he moved. All the frustrations of the past hours built up in him  a raging desire to do something--anything--just so long as it was what  _he_ wanted to do and not at another's orders.    Nevertheless, Ross continued to move slowly, for the space beyond that  open door was as deep and dark a pit as the room he left. To squeeze  along one wall, using an outstretched arm as a guide, was the best  procedure, he decided.    A few feet farther on, his shoulder slipped from the surface and he half  tumbled into another open door. But there was the wall again, and he  clung to it thankfully. Another door ... Ross paused, trying to catch  some faint sound, the slightest hint that he was not alone in this  blindman's maze. But without even air currents to stir it, the blackness  itself took on a thick solidity which encased him as a congealing jelly.    The wall ended. Ross kept his left hand on it, flailed out with his  right, and felt his nails scrape across another surface. The space  separating the two surfaces was wider than any doorway. Was it a  cross-corridor? He was about to make a wider arm sweep when he heard a  sound. He was not alone.    Ross went back to the wall, flattening himself against it, trying to  control the volume of his own breathing in order to catch the slightest  whisper of the other noise. He discovered that lack of sight can confuse  the ear. He could not identify those clicks, the wisp of fluttering  sound that might be air displaced by the opening of another door.    Finally, he detected something moving at floor level. Someone or  something must be creeping, not walking, toward him. Ross pushed back  around the corner. It never occurred to him to challenge that crawler.  There was an element of danger in this strange encounter in the dark; it  was not meant to be a meeting between fellow explorers.    The sound of crawling was not steady. There were long pauses, and Ross  became convinced that each rest was punctuated by heavy breathing as if  the crawler was finding progress a great and exhausting effort. He  fought the picture that persisted in his imagination--that of a wolf  snuffling along the blacked-out hall. Caution suggested a quick retreat,  but Ross's urge to rebellion held him where he was, crouching, straining  to see what crept toward him.    Suddenly there was a blinding flare of light, and Ross's hands went to  cover his dazzled eyes. And he heard a despairing, choked exclamation  from near to floor level. The same steady light that normally filled  hall and room was bright again. Ross found himself standing at the  juncture of two corridors--momentarily, he was absurdly pleased that he  had deduced that correctly--and the crawler--?    A man--at least the figure was a two-legged, two-armed body reasonably  human in outline--was lying several yards away. But the body was so  wrapped in bandages and the head so totally muffled, that it lacked all  identity. For that reason it was the more startling.    One of the mittened hands moved slightly, raising the body from the  ground so it could squirm forward an inch or so. Before Ross could move,  a man came running into the corridor from the far end. Murdock  recognized Major Kelgarries. He wet his lips as the major went down on  his knees beside the creature on the floor.    \"Hardy! Hardy!\" That voice, which carried the snap of command whenever  it was addressed to Ross, was now warmly human. \"Hardy, man!\" The  major's hands were on the bandaged body, lifting it, easing the head and  shoulders back against his arm. \"It's all right, Hardy. You're  back--safe. This is the base, Hardy.\" He spoke slowly, soothingly, with  the steadiness one would use to comfort a frightened child.    Those mittened paws which had beat feebly into the air fell onto the  bandage-wreathed chest. \"Back--safe--\" The voice from behind the face  mask was a rusty croak.    \"Back, safe,\" the major assured him.    \"Dark--dark all around again--\" protested the croak.    \"Just a power failure, man. Everything's all right now. We'll get you  into bed.\"    The mitten pawed again until it touched Kelgarries' arm; then it flexed  a little as if the hand under it was trying to grip.    \"Safe--?\"    \"You bet you are!\" The major's tone carried firm reassurance. Now  Kelgarries looked up at Ross as if he knew the other had been there all  the time.    \"Murdock, get down to the end room. Call Dr. Farrell!\"    \"Yes, sir!\" The \"sir\" came so automatically that Ross had already  reached the end room before he realized he had used it.    Nobody explained matters to Ross Murdock. The bandaged Hardy was claimed  by the doctor and two attendants and carried away, the major walking  beside the stretcher, still holding one of the mittened hands in his.  Ross hesitated, sure he was not supposed to follow, but not ready either  to explore farther or return to his own room. The sight of Hardy,  whoever he might be, had radically changed Ross's conception of the  project he had too speedily volunteered to join.    That what they did here was important, Ross had never doubted. That it  was dangerous, he had early suspected. But his awareness had been an  abstract concept of danger, not connected with such concrete evidence as  Hardy crawling through the dark. From the first, Ross had nursed vague  plans for escape; now he knew he must get out of this place lest he end  up a twin for Hardy.    \"Murdock?\"    Having heard no warning sound from behind, Ross whirled, ready to use  his fists, his only weapons. But he did not face the major, or any of  the other taciturn men he knew held positions of authority. The  newcomer's brown skin was startling against the neutral shade of the  walls. His hair and brows were only a few shades darker; but the general  sameness of color was relieved by the vivid blue of his eyes.    Expressionless, the dark stranger stood quietly, his arms hanging  loosely by his sides, studying Ross, as if the younger man was some  problem he had been assigned to solve. When he spoke, his voice was a  monotone lacking any modulation of feeling.    \"I am Ashe.\" He introduced himself baldly; he might have been saying  \"This is a table and that is a chair.\"    Ross's quick temper took spark from the other's indifference. \"All  right--so you're Ashe!\" He strove to make a challenge of it. \"And what  is that supposed to mean?\"    But the other did not rise to the bait. He shrugged. \"For the time being  we have been partnered----\"    \"Partnered for what?\" demanded Ross, controlling his temper.    \"We work in pairs here. The machine sorts us ...\" he answered briefly  and"]]]
