The turkey and iguana  glyphs are very often found with a _Kan_ sign indicating an offering of  maize and bread as well as that of the animal. In connection with glyphs  showing various offerings of food, there is one which occurs especially  in the Tro-Cortesianus (as in 106a). This shows a row of points  themselves running to a point over a _Kan_ sign. This, as will be  pointed out later (p. 318) may also represent an iguana. The jar  containing a representation of the honey comb (as in Tro-Cortesianus  107b) might come in here in the consideration of the offering-glyphs.    In many instances the common offerings shown by glyphs are found  associated with the signs for the four cardinal points but there does  not seem to be any strict uniformity as to the special offering  associated with each direction. In Dresden 29b, the lizard glyph is  found in the same group with the sign commonly assigned to the east, the  turkey with the south, the iguana with the west, and the fish with the  north while in Dresden 29c, the deer is associated with the east, the  fish with the south, the iguana with the west, and the turkey with the  north. The iguana is usually found with the sign for the west and the  fish with that of the south. The others vary greatly in the assignment  of the various directions.    Schellhas (1904, p. 17) considers that the fish, the lizard, \"the  sprouting kernel of maize or (according to Foerstemann, parts of a  mammal, game)\" and a vulture's head are symbols of the four elements.  The head which Schellhas interprets as that of the vulture is certainly  the head of a turkey. He remarks that these signs of the four elements  appear with god B in the Dresden manuscript. Other gods, as he also  notes, are found with these four offering-glyphs. There seems to be a  fifth glyph, however, (as in Dresden 29b) which we have interpreted as  that of a lizard.    ANIMALS AS RAIN BEARERS. Various animals are associated with the rain  and water. The serpent is most frequently represented in this  connection. Snails, fish, the turtle, and the frog, as well as the  lizard-crocodile figure in Dresden 74 are naturally found associated  with water. The vulture-headed figure in Dresden 38b and the vulture as  a bird in Tro-Cortesianus 10a both appear in the rain. The peccary  (Dresden 68a), and the turkey (Tro-Cortesianus 10b) appear associated  with the rain as well as with the constellation bands. The scorpion  (Tro-Cortesianus 7a) encloses the rain within its legs.    The connection of an old female figure occurring in many places in the  codices with the rain will be discussed later (p. 316) when considering  the serpent. It remains at this place to comment upon the woman in  Tro-Cortesianus 30b from whose breasts water is flowing. She is  represented as having animal figures seated on her two outstretched  hands and on her right foot together with another animal at her side.  God B sits on her left foot. This picture immediately recalls  representations in the Mexican codices where the various parts of the  body of a god are associated with various day signs, ten of which have  animal names. In the Maya picture, a jaguar is shown on the right hand,  a peccary on the left, a dog on the right foot, and a rabbit beside the  body at her right. The peccary is not represented among the Nahua day  signs but the other three are found, namely the _oceolotl_ (jaguar),  _itzcuintli_ (dog), and _tochtli_ (rabbit).    ANIMAL HEAD-DRESSES. Animal figures appear perhaps most frequently as  head-dresses of the various gods in the codices. Here, as elsewhere,  from all that can be made out, the religious character is uppermost as  in addition to being a decoration, they undoubtedly have some religious  signification. Birds occur by far most commonly in this connection. Both  male and female figures seems to have these head-dresses. The same bird  is often found as the head-dress of several different gods as, for  example, the turkey which appears with gods A, B, C, E, and N. The  vulture, on the other hand, when used as a head-dress for male figures,  appears exclusively with god F. The whole bird is seldom represented on  the head-dress of the male figures. It is usually only the head and a  part of the body of the bird which forms but a portion of the whole  head-covering. Landa (1864, p. 148)[292-*] notes the dress of the leader  in the rites. He wears a jacket of red feathers worked with other  feathers and from it hang long plumes. He also wears a feather  head-dress.    Entire birds appear as the sole head-covering only in connection with  female figures and then only in one section of the Dresden (16-18) and a  parallel passage in the Tro-Cortesianus (94-95). In both these places  the conception and the bearing of children are shown together with their  baptism. The bird above the head of each female figure seems to be a  badge of office, possibly the totems which are held by the women and  given to the children. The parrot, quetzal, vulture, screech owl and the  horned owl appear in this connection. It is to be noted that the birds  associated with these women are not really represented as head-dresses  at all. They are quite different from the head decoration composed of a  bird's head and feathers seen in other parts of the manuscripts. In the  Dresden especially, these birds above the women's heads are shown in  almost every case standing with the claws clasping the necklace at the  back of the neck. Landa (1864, pp. 144-154) gives an interesting account  of the method of baptising children. He also states (p. 304)[292-[+]]  that in the month _Yaxkin_ an old woman brought the little girls to the  general feast. This old woman was dressed in a garment of feathers. It  was understood that this devoted old woman was not permitted to become  intoxicated[293-*] lest she should lose in the road the plume of her  office.    The serpent appears as a head-dress exclusively with female figures and  then usually when the woman is in the act of offering something or is  associated with water or rain. The centipede occurs only with god D.  Quadrupeds are employed as head-dresses only very seldom. The head of a  deer is, in three places, used as a part of the head decoration of god M  and the head of a jaguar appears in two places only.    SECULAR OCCUPATIONS. Animals appear frequently in scenes showing various  occupations. These, although appearing at first sight as secular, have  to do with the religion of the people and they show in every case acts  undertaken in behalf of the deities. It is almost exclusively in the  Tro-Cortesianus that these religious-secular occupations are shown.    Hunting scenes occur in one section of this codex (38-49). The whole aim  of the hunt in these pages is to obtain animals for sacrifice. In almost  every case the various animals are shown as being captured alive, either  in a pitfall or a trap of the \"jerk-up\" type. This was undoubtedly in  order that the animal might be killed the moment it was offered to the  gods by having its heart cut out. Deer are most commonly represented in  this hunting section although peccaries and armadillos also appear.  Fishing is shown in one place at least (Dresden 33a).    The practice of agriculture is shown in Tro-Cortesianus 24-28. The  sprouting grain is represented as being eaten by a vulture and a jaguar.  Certain gods in this section which relates to the planting of maize are  shown as being attacked by vultures and blow-flies. Another occupation  of the natives depicted in the Tro-Cortesianus (103-112) is apiculture.  This, again, has clearly some religious significance. Pottery-making is  shown in the same manuscript (95-101). It is, however, a purely  religious ceremony. The renewal of the incense-burners is shown.  Animals occur very infrequently in this section. The quetzal and two  vultures are noted seated on top of an oven-like covering under which is  the head of god C, probably representing the idol. There are several  other occupations shown in this codex such as weaving (79c) and the  gathering of the sap of the rubber tree (102b), but as animals do not  occur in any connection with these operations, it is not necessary to  dwell upon them.    ANIMAL GLYPHS. It remains finally to speak of the various animals which  are represented in glyph form as well as drawn in full in the pictures  proper. The creatures pictured in the codices are often accompanied by  their glyphs which appear in the lines of signs directly above. In many  cases, the animal pictured below is not represented by its glyph above  and, vice versa, the animal glyph may appear without its picture below.  The same is seen also in connection with the representation of the gods  and their glyphs. Both the picture and the glyph usually appear but  either may appear alone. Many times when the glyph, either of a god or  an animal, is shown with no accompanying picture, the reason seems to be  that there is no room for the latter on account of the numerical  calculations which take up all the space.    There are some animals in the codices which are represented by glyphs  very frequently. Among these are the screech owl (the Moan, the bird of  death), which has several different glyphs by which it is recognized,  the dog which, in addition to its own glyph, may be represented by the  day sign _Oc_, the king vulture, the turtle, the bee (if we consider the  day sign _Cauac_ stands for this insect), and the centipede. Among the  animals whose glyphs only seldom appear may be mentioned the macaw, the  peccary, the tree-toad (god P), the quetzal, and the jaguar. The glyph  for the black vulture (Tro-Cortesianus 26c), the ape (Tro-Cortesianus  88c), the deer (Peresianus 10), the eagle (Tro-Cortesianus 107c), and  the serpent (Tro-Cortesianus 106c) seem to appear but once.

And in the same  way, the eminent Dr. Cartwright, then of Natchez, and President of the  State Medical Association of Mississippi, came to a knowledge of those  principles, which, as we shall hereafter show, he so remarkably  elucidated.    In September, 1846, the _New York Journal of Medicine_, then edited by  Dr. Charles A. Lee, contained a review or critique on my work, which, if  the history of the theory shall hereafter become a matter of special  interest, may, with my reply, contained in the March number of 1847,  furnish any examiner with the full state of the question at that period.    The learned reviewer showed himself acquainted with the subject as it  then stood, and with its history in the past. He held that the heart's  action, \"the contractile power of the cardiac walls,\" is the main spring  or _primum mobile_, from which the circulating force proceeds,  notwithstanding the great discrepancies as to what that force is; and  while he objected to my theory, that it did not show any distinct  measure of force, he said that, while Borelli estimated the contractive  power of the heart at 180,000 pounds, Keill stated it at five ounces,  Sir Charles Bell at 51 pounds, Carpenter at 511/2, and Hales at 50. He  abandoned, however, Harvey's idea that the heart was the only organ of  circulation. He believed that it was assisted by the contractile power  of the arteries, by the movement of the ribs and chest in respiration,  by capillary attraction, muscular contraction in exercise, and several  other forces; one of which, the attraction of the venous blood for the  pulmonary cells, had been recently pointed out by Dr. Draper. The author  did not suppose he was bringing forward any new truths; \"but,\" said he,  as an introduction to his account of my theory, \"are we not sometimes in  danger of forsaking old truths for new theories?\"    Of my theory, he says: \"The mere statement of it must satisfy our  readers that it is wholly untenable. It is well known that heat is  generated in every part of the system as well as the lungs. Whenever  oxygen and carbon unite, there it is developed; but it is imparted to  the _solids_ equally with the fluids; it maintains the temperature of  the whole body by radiations from the points where it is generated.\" ...  \"It is believed that all those functions of the organism which are  necessary for the preservation of life, contribute directly or  indirectly to the production of animal heat; so that it is developed at  every point at which metamorphosis is occurring, and therefore not  merely in the lungs, but in the whole peripheral system.\"    The writer then observes, that \"the heat of the venous blood as it  reaches the right side of the heart (according to Davy), varies only two  or three degrees from that of the aorta. Granting, then, that the blood  receives three degrees in the lungs, it is very evident that the  expansion produced by it would be too small to be appreciable. The  cause, then, is insufficient to produce the effects.\" The writer gives  me credit for having ingeniously supported my theory, and then politely  bows me out of the department of physiology into my more appropriate  sphere of educating girls.    In my reply, this sentence from Cuvier was chosen as a motto:  \"Respiration is the function essential to the constitution of an animal  body; it is that which, in a manner, animalizes it; and we shall see  that animals exercise their peculiar functions more completely according  as they enjoy greater powers of respiration.\"[5] My reasoning was to  this effect: \"It is in vain to say that cannot be, which is.\" When  two events are so conjoined in nature that one is the only invariable  antecedent of the other, then, according to all logic, we are bound to  conclude that the first is the physical cause of the second, even though  we cannot understand how it should be. Of the circulation, such living  respiration as produces heat is the invariable antecedent, and nothing  else is. The heart's action, as stated by our reviewer himself, is not  therefore respiration, and not the heart's action or anything else, is  the cause of the circulation. This argument is upheld by the fact that  circulation, varies not only as respiration, but as its products  digestion, strength, and, according to Cuvier, animal vitality vary. All  begin with respiration, end with it, and are as it is. If respiration  ceases, restore it before the organism is deranged, and they are all  restored. We must conclude, then, that respiration is the cause of  circulation, although we could not see how it should be. Much more, when  we discern a mighty power, that of expansion, and see how the Almighty  has made our frame in reference to its production by caloric--the lungs  allowing of heat within them like wet cloth, and the nerves, bones and  muscles all made and arranged, so that oxygen shall be brought to them  by respiration on the one hand, and carbon by the numerous digestive and  circulatory organs on the other.    As to any deficiency of power, my reviewer had omitted to notice that  not only the ordinary expansion of the water of the blood by calorie had  been assumed, but also its vaporization, or the change of such a portion  as was needed into steam, the lungs being _in vacuo_; so that nature  here had not failed of her usual abundance. And had not this power been  kept in check by the pressure of the surrounding air hindering the  perfect vacuum of the lungs, there was reason to fear, rather its excess  than its deficiency. As to the reviewer's assertion that heat is  generated in every part of the system, and imparted to the _solids_  equally with the fluids--that I positively denied, in the name of common  sense. For who does not know that, although there may be some heat  elaborated in the stomach, and some during the processes by which the  fluids change to solids, that the great source of heat to the system, is  in the fluid blood, and not in solid flesh or bone? Our senses of sight  and feeling show us, in the case of blushing, that heat comes and goes  with the blood. No one believes that the solid parts of his leg warm the  blood as much as it warms them. Finally, it discredited the old theory,  that it showed no adequate use for the great primary function of  respiration, and its constant attendant, animal heat. Breathing and  warmth are not ultimate ends. Man breathes to live; he does not live to  breathe. He is warm to live; he does not live merely to be warm. Our  theory shows that it is these primary agencies which sustain his being;  and it sets forth the manner in which they operate for this end. And  thus, while it indicates the wisdom of the Almighty in the formation of  the animal frame, it shows itself to be His true interpreter.      SECTION III.    Uses of the Theory--Proofs.--Publication of a Work, in 1849, entitled      \"Respiration and its Effects, more, especially in relation to      Asiatic Cholera and other Sinking Diseases.\"--Examples.    TO DR. MARCY.--The theory of the two chief motive powers which operate  at the centre was, we conceive, completed by the addition of steam  formed in the vacuum of the lungs, as available to give to the blood its  due velocity. We also believe that complete proof _a priori_ had been  adduced of the fallacy of the theory that the _primum mobile_ is in the  heart; and, also, that proof _a priori_ had been given that it begins at  the lungs, and is the product of respiration. It remained to apply this  theory to use, and to find proofs _a posteriori_.    Although some of my friends regarded my theory as an _ignis fatuus_  which led me into nothing but evil, yet it has enabled me, by plans of  exercise, to endure for many years, in-door sedentary labor--and yet  enjoy health; and in unusual emergencies, more than once to save my own  life and that of others.    In the cold winter of 1835, I took, at Troy, the old summer stage, at  midnight, to cross the Green Mountains. I was alone in the large and  ill-closed vehicle; the thermometer was sinking as I proceeded on my  way, until it had reached 25 deg. below zero, a degree of cold to which I  had never before been subjected. When I had traveled alone twenty miles,  I found myself in imminent danger of perishing. Ordinary expedients to  get warmth were no longer availing; numbness and cold at the vitals were  overcoming me; and I knew that to give way to them was to die. I thought  of my theory; but I was fearful that I should commit sin if I tampered  with the sacred \"breath of life.\" But my necessity was urgent, and I  aroused, stood up, and breathed that dense air with violence. It felt  for the moment cold to my lungs, but soon came heat with a rush, and  with it pain, as if the whole surface of the throat and lungs were  blistered; and my first thought was that I should die, justly punished  for my temerity. But soon I was restored to genial warmth; and rejoiced  in having successfully made an important physiological experiment.    Afterwards, having been instrumental in relieving a woman who was  perishing from having breathed the fumes of charcoal, I was led to  reflect that in such cases there was something to be taken away from the  lungs, as well as warmth to be added. This woman's extreme coldness, and  feeble, fluttering pulse, showed that she was dying for want of right  breathing; and in her case there was no doubt that the cause was the  same as that of death by drowning. The carbonic acid gas which she had  inspired, being heavier than atmospheric air, settled as water in her  lungs, and in the same manner prevented the access of oxygen to their  living tissues. And hence arose the reflection that the ordinary  carbonic acid gas, which is always the residuum of respiration, might,  from weakness, settle in the lungs, and thus become the cause of disease  and death. The presence of carbonic acid in the lower bronchial tubes  and cells, existing "]]]
