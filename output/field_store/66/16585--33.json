Therefore those who were attached and held tenaciously to  the name Abraham were deprived when the Abrahamic virtues reappeared in  Moses. Similarly the Jews were believers in His Holiness Moses, awaiting  the coming of the Messiah. The virtues and perfections of Moses became  apparent in His Holiness Jesus Christ most effulgently but the Jews held  to the name Moses, not adoring the virtues and perfections manifest in  him. Had they been adoring these virtues and seeking these perfections  they would assuredly have believed in His Holiness Jesus Christ when the  same virtues and perfections shone in him. If we are lovers of the light  we adore it in whatever lamp it may become manifest but if we love the  lamp itself and the light is transferred to another lamp we will neither  accept nor sanction it. Therefore we must follow and adore the virtues  revealed in the messengers of God whether in Abraham, Moses, Jesus or  other prophets but we must not adhere to and adore the lamp. We must  recognize the sun no matter from what dawning-point it may shine forth, be  it Mosaic, Abrahamic or any personal point of orientation whatever, for we  are lovers of sunlight and not of orientation. We are lovers of  illumination and not of lamps and candles. We are seekers for water no  matter from what rock it may gush forth. We are in need of fruit in  whatsoever orchard it may be ripened. We long for rain it matters not  which cloud pours it down. We must not be fettered. If we renounce these  fetters we shall agree, for all are seekers of reality. The counterfeit or  imitation of true religion has adulterated human belief and the  foundations have been lost sight of. The variance of these imitations has  produced enmity and strife, war and bloodshed. Now the glorious and  brilliant twentieth century has dawned and the divine bounty is radiating  universally. The Sun of Truth is shining forth in intense enkindlement.  This is verily the century when these imitations must be forsaken,  superstitions abandoned and God alone worshiped. We must look at the  reality of the prophets and their teachings in order that we may agree.    Praise be to God! the springtime of God is at hand. This century is verily  the spring season. The world of mind and the kingdom of soul have become  fresh and verdant by its bestowals. It has resuscitated the whole realm of  existence. On one hand the lights of reality are shining; on the other the  clouds of divine mercy are pouring down the fullness of heavenly bounty.  Wonderful material progress is evident and great spiritual discoveries are  being made. Truly this can be called the miracle of centuries for it is  replete with manifestations of the miraculous. The time has come when all  mankind shall be united, when all races shall be loyal to one fatherland,  all religions become one religion and racial and religious bias pass away.  It is a day in which the oneness of humankind shall uplift its standard  and international peace like the true morning flood the world with its  light. Therefore we offer supplications to God, asking him to dispel these  gloomy clouds and uproot these imitations in order that the East and West  may become radiant with love and unity; that the nations of the world  shall embrace each other and the ideal spiritual brotherhood illumine the  world like the glorious sun of the high heavens.            THE CAUSE OF STRIFE      In the estimation of historians this radiant century is equivalent to one  hundred centuries of the past. If comparison be made with the sum total of  all former human achievements it will be found that the discoveries,  scientific advancement and material civilization of this present century  have equaled, yea far exceeded the progress and outcome of one hundred  former centuries. The production of books and compilations of literature  alone bear witness that the output of the human mind in this century has  been greater and more enlightening than all the past centuries together.  It is evident therefore that this century is of paramount importance.  Reflect upon the miracles of accomplishment which have already  characterized it, the discoveries in every realm of human research,  inventions, scientific knowledge, ethical reforms and regulations  established for the welfare of humanity, mysteries of nature explored,  invisible forces brought into visibility and subjection, a veritable  wonder-world of new phenomena and conditions heretofore unknown to man now  open to his uses and further investigation. The East and West can  communicate instantly. A human being can soar in the skies or speed in  submarine depths. The power of steam has linked the continents. Trains  cross the deserts and pierce the barriers of mountains; ships find  unerring pathways upon the trackless oceans. Day by day discoveries are  increasing. What a wonderful century this is! It is an age of universal  re-formation. Laws and statutes of governments civil and federal are in  process of change and transformation. Sciences and arts are being moulded  anew. Thoughts are metamorphosed. The foundations of human society are  changing and strengthening. Today sciences of the past are useless. The  ptolemaic system of astronomy, numberless other systems and theories of  scientific and philosophical explanation are discarded, known to be false  and worthless. Ethical precedents and principles cannot be applied to the  needs of the modern world. Thoughts and theories of past ages are  fruitless now. Thrones and governments are crumbling and falling. All  conditions and requisites of the past unfitted and inadequate for the  present time, are undergoing radical reform.    It is evident therefore that counterfeit and spurious religious teaching,  antiquated forms of belief and ancestral imitations which are at variance  with the foundations of divine reality must also pass away and be  re-formed. They must be abandoned and new conditions be recognized. The  morals of humanity must undergo change. New remedy and solution for human  problems must be adopted. Human intellects themselves must change and be  subject to the universal reformation. Just as the thoughts and hypotheses  of past ages are fruitless today, likewise dogmas and codes of human  invention are obsolete and barren of product in religion. Nay, it is true  that they are the cause of enmity and conducive to strife in the world of  humanity; war and bloodshed proceed from them and the oneness of mankind  finds no recognition in their observance. Therefore it is our duty in this  radiant century to investigate the essentials of divine religion, seek the  realities underlying the oneness of the world of humanity and discover the  source of fellowship and agreement which will unite mankind in the  heavenly bond of love. This unity is the radiance of eternity, the divine  spirituality, the effulgence of God and the bounty of the Kingdom. We must  investigate the divine source of these heavenly bestowals and adhere unto  them steadfastly. For if we remain fettered and restricted by human  inventions and dogmas, day by day the world of mankind will be degraded,  day by day warfare and strife will increase and satanic forces converge  toward the destruction of the human race.    If love and agreement are manifest in a single family, that family will  advance, become illumined and spiritual; but if enmity and hatred exist  within it destruction and dispersion are inevitable. This is likewise true  of a city. If those who dwell within it manifest a spirit of accord and  fellowship it will progress steadily and human conditions become brighter  whereas through enmity and strife it will be degraded and its inhabitants  scattered. In the same way the people of a nation develop and advance  toward civilization and enlightenment through love and accord, and are  disintegrated by war and strife. Finally, this is true of humanity itself  in the aggregate. When love is realized and the ideal spiritual bonds  unite the hearts of men, the whole human race will be uplifted, the world  will continually grow more spiritual and radiant and the happiness and  tranquillity of mankind be immeasurably increased. Warfare and strife will  be uprooted, disagreement and dissension pass away and universal peace  unite the nations and peoples of the world. All mankind will dwell  together as one family, blend as the waves of one sea, shine as stars of  one firmament and appear as fruits of the same tree. This is the happiness  and felicity of humankind. This is the illumination of man, the glory  eternal and life everlasting; this is the divine bestowal. I desire this  station for you and I pray God that the people of America may achieve this  great end in order that the virtue of this democracy may be insured and  their names be glorified eternally.            UNIVERSAL PEACE      Today there is no greater glory for man than that of service in the cause  of the \"Most Great Peace\". Peace is light whereas war is darkness. Peace  is life; war is death. Peace is guidance; war is error. Peace is the  foundation of God; war is satanic institution. Peace is the illumination  of the world of humanity; war is the destroyer of human foundations. When  we consider outcomes in the world of existence we find that peace and  fellowship are factors of upbuilding and betterment whereas war and strife  are the causes of destruction and disintegration. All created things are  expressions of the affinity and cohesion of elementary substances, and  non-existence is the absence of their attraction and agreement. Various  elements unite harmoniously in composition but when these elements become  discordant, repelling each other, decomposition and non-existence result.  Everything partakes of this nature and is subject to this principle, for  the creative foundation in all its degrees and kingdoms is an expression  or outcome of love. Consider the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19239"],[0,"Bahá'í World Faith (#3)"],[1,"He  was exiled in the expectation that Iran would become quiet. His  banishment, however, produced the opposite effect. New tumult arose and  the mention of His greatness and influence spread everywhere throughout  the country. The proclamation of His manifestation and mission was made in  Ba_gh_dad. He called his friends together there and spoke to them of God.  Afterward He left the city and went alone into the mountains of Kurdistan  where He made his abode in caves and grottoes. A part of this time He  lived in the city of Sulimaniyye. Two years passed during which neither  His friends nor family knew just where He was.    Although solitary, secluded and unknown in His retirement, the report  spread throughout Kurdistan that this was a most remarkable and learned  personage gifted with a wonderful power of attraction. In a short time  Kurdistan was magnetized with His love. During this period Baha'u'llah  lived in poverty. His garments were those of the poor and needy. His food  was that of the indigent and lowly. An atmosphere of majesty haloed Him as  the sun at midday. Everywhere He was greatly revered and beloved.    After two years He returned to Ba_gh_dad. Friends He had known in  Sulimaniyye came to visit Him. They found Him in his accustomed  environment of ease and affluence and were astonished at the appointments  of one who had lived in seclusion under such frugal conditions in  Kurdistan.    The Iranian government believed the banishment of the Blessed Perfection  from Iran would be the extermination of His Cause in that country. These  rulers now realized that it spread more rapidly. His prestige increased,  His teachings became more widely circulated. The chiefs of Iran then used  their influence to have Baha'u'llah exiled from Ba_gh_dad. He was summoned  to Constantinople by the Turkish authorities. While in Constantinople He  ignored every restriction, especially the hostility of ministers of state  and clergy. The official representatives of Iran again brought their  influence to bear upon the Turkish authorities and succeeded in having  Baha'u'llah banished from Constantinople to Adrianople, the object being  to keep Him as far away as possible from Iran and render His communication  with that country more difficult. Nevertheless the Cause still spread and  strengthened.    Finally they consulted together and said: \"We have banished Baha'u'llah  from place to place but each time he is exiled his cause is more widely  extended, his proclamation increases in power and day by day his lamp is  becoming brighter. This is due to the fact that we have exiled him to  large cities and populous centers. Therefore we will send him to a penal  colony as a prisoner so that all may know he is the associate of  murderers, robbers and criminals; in a short time he and his followers  will perish.\" The sultan of Turkey then banished Him to the prison of Akka  in Syria.    When Baha'u'llah arrived at Akka, through the power of God He was able to  hoist His banner. His light at first had been a star; now it became a  mighty sun and the illumination of His Cause expanded from the east to the  west. Inside prison walls He wrote epistles to all the kings and rulers of  nations summoning them to arbitration and Universal Peace. Some of the  kings received His words with disdain and contempt. One of these was the  sultan of the Ottoman kingdom. Napoleon III of France did not reply. A  second epistle was addressed to him. It stated: \"I have written you an  epistle before this, summoning you to the cause of God but you are of the  heedless. You have proclaimed that you were the defender of the oppressed;  now it hath become evident that you are not. Nor are you kind to your own  suffering and oppressed people. Your actions are contrary to your own  interests and your kingly pride must fall. Because of your arrogance God  shortly will destroy your sovereignty. France will flee away from you and  you will be overwhelmed by a great conquest. There will be lamentation and  mourning, women bemoaning the loss of their sons.\" This arraignment of  Napoleon III was published and spread.    Read it and consider: One prisoner, single and solitary, without assistant  or defender, a foreigner and stranger imprisoned in the fortress of Akka  writing such letters to the emperor of France and sultan of Turkey.  Reflect upon this how Baha'u'llah upraised the standard of His Cause in  prison. Refer to history. It is without parallel. No such thing has  happened before that time nor since; a prisoner and an exile advancing His  Cause and spreading His teachings broadcast so that eventually He became  powerful enough to conquer the very king who banished Him.    His Cause spread more and more. The Blessed Perfection was a prisoner  twenty-five years. During all this time He was subjected to the  indignities and revilement of the people. He was persecuted, mocked and  put in chains. In Iran His properties were pillaged and His possessions  confiscated. First, banishment from Iran to Ba_gh_dad; then to  Constantinople; then Adrianople; finally from Roumelia to the prison  fortress of Akka.    During His lifetime He was intensely active. His energy was unlimited.  Scarcely one night was passed in restful sleep. He bore these ordeals,  suffered these calamities and difficulties in order that a manifestation  of selflessness and service might become apparent in the world of  humanity; that the Most Great Peace should become a reality; that human  souls might appear as the angels of heaven; that heavenly miracles would  be wrought among men; that human faith should be strengthened and  perfected; that the precious, priceless bestowal of God, the human mind,  might be developed to its fullest capacity in the temple of the body; and  man become the reflection and likeness of God, even as it hath been  revealed in the Bible: \"We shall create man in Our own image.\"    Briefly; the Blessed Perfection bore all these ordeals and calamities in  order that our hearts might become enkindled and radiant, our spirits be  glorified, our faults become virtues, our ignorance transformed into  knowledge; in order that we might attain the real fruits of humanity and  acquire heavenly graces; although pilgrims upon earth we should travel the  road of the heavenly kingdom; although needy and poor we might receive the  treasures of life eternal. For this has He borne these difficulties and  sorrows.    Trust all to God. The lights of God are resplendent. The blessed epistles  are spreading. The blessed teachings are promulgated throughout the east  and west. Soon you will see that the heavenly words have established the  oneness of the world of humanity. The banner of the Most Great Peace has  been unfurled and the \"great community\" is appearing.          RELIGION IS PROGRESSIVE      Religion is the outer expression of the divine reality. Therefore it must  be living, vitalized, moving and progressive. If it be without motion and  non-progressive it is without the divine life; it is dead. The divine  institutes are continuously active and evolutionary; therefore the  revelation of them must be progressive and continuous. All things are  subject to re-formation. This is a century of life and renewal. Sciences  and arts, industry and invention have been reformed. Law and ethics have  been reconstituted, reorganized. The world of thought has been  regenerated. Sciences of former ages and philosophies of the past are  useless today. Present exigencies demand new methods of solution; world  problems are without precedent. Old ideas and modes of thought are fast  becoming obsolete. Ancient laws and archaic ethical systems will not meet  the requirements of modern conditions, for this is clearly the century of  a new life, the century of the revelation of the reality and therefore the  greatest of all centuries. Consider how the scientific developments of  fifty years have surpassed and eclipsed the knowledge and achievements of  all the former ages combined. Would the announcements and theories of  ancient astronomers explain our present knowledge of the sun-worlds and  planetary systems? Would the mask of obscurity which beclouded mediaeval  centuries meet the demand for clear-eyed vision and understanding which  characterizes the world today? Will the despotism of former governments  answer the call for freedom which has risen from the heart of humanity in  this cycle of illumination? It is evident that no vital results are now  forthcoming from the customs, institutions and standpoints of the past. In  view of this, shall blind imitations of ancestral forms and theological  interpretations continue to guide and control the religious life and  spiritual development of humanity today? Shall man gifted with the power  of reason unthinkingly follow and adhere to dogma, creeds and hereditary  beliefs which will not bear the analysis of reason in this century of  effulgent reality? Unquestionably this will not satisfy men of science,  for when they find premise or conclusion contrary to present standards of  proof and without real foundation, they reject that which has been  formerly accepted as standard and correct and move forward from new  foundations.    The divine prophets have revealed and founded religion. They have laid  down certain laws and heavenly principles for the guidance of mankind.  They have taught and promulgated the knowledge of God, established  praiseworthy ethical ideals and inculcated the highest standards of  virtues in the human world. Gradually these heavenly teachings and  foundations of reality have been beclouded by human interpretations and  dogmatic imitations of ancestral beliefs. The essential realities which  the prophets labored so hard to establish in human hearts and minds while  undergoing ordeals and suffering tortures of persecution, have now well  nigh vanished. Some of these heavenly messengers have been killed, some"]]]
