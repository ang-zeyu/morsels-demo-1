Pandulf, who was restored to his legateship, was active in  suppressing this rebellion; and with the concurrence of eleven bishops,  he pronounced the sentence of excommunication against Albemarle and his  adherents:[*] an army was levied: a scutage of ten shillings a knight's  fee was imposed on all the military tenants. Albemarle's associates  gradually deserted him; and he himself was obliged at last to sue for  mercy. He received a pardon, and was restored to his whole estate.    This impolitic lenity, too frequent in those times, was probably the  result of a secret combination among the barons, who never could endure  to see the total ruin of one of their own order: but it encouraged  Fawkes de Breaute, a man whom King John had raised from a low origin, to  persevere in the course of violence to which he had owed his fortune and  to set at nought all law and justice. When thirty-five verdicts were at  one time found against him, on account of his violent expulsion of so  many freeholders from their possessions, he came to the court of justice  with an armed force, seized the judge who had pronounced the verdicts,  and imprisoned him in Bedford Castle. He then levied open war against  the king; but being subdued and taken prisoner, his life was  granted him; but his estate was confiscated, and he was banished the  kingdom.[**]         * Chron. Dunst. vol. i. p. 102.         ** Rymer, vol. i. p. 198. M. Paris, p. 221, 224. Ann. Waverl       p. 188, Chron. Dunst vol. i. p. 141, 146. M. West, p. 283.    {1222.} Justice was executed with greater severity against disorders  less premeditated, which broke out in London. A frivolous emulation in  a match of wrestling, between the Londoners on the one hand, and the  inhabitants of Westminster and those of the neighboring villages on the  other, occasioned this commotion. The former rose in a body, and pulled  down some houses belonging to the abbot of Westminster: but this riot,  which, considering the tumultuous disposition familiar to that capital,  would have been little regarded, seemed to become more serious by the  symptoms which then appeared of the former attachment of the citizens to  the French interest. The populace, in the tumult, made use of the cry  of war commonly employed by the French troops: \"Mountjoy, Mountjoy,  God help us and our lord Lewis.\" The justiciary made inquiry into the  disorder; and finding one Constantine Fitz-Arnulf to have been the  ring-*leader, an insolent man, who justified his crime in Hubert's  presence, he proceeded against him by martial law, and ordered him  immediately to be hanged, without trial or form of process. He also cut  off the feet of some of Constantine's accomplices.[*]    This act of power was complained of as an infringement of the Great  Charter: yet the justiciary, in a parliament summoned at Oxford, (for  the great councils about this time began to receive that appellation,)  made no scruple to grant in the king's name a renewal and confirmation  of that charter. When the assembly made application to the crown for  this favor,--as a law in those times seemed to lose its validity if not  frequently renewed,--William de Briewere, one of the council of regency,  was so bold as to say openly, that those liberties were extorted by  force, and ought not to be observed: but he was reprimanded by the  archbishop of Canterbury, and was not countenanced by the king or his  chief ministers.[**] A new confirmation was demanded and granted two  years after; and an aid, amounting to a fifteenth of all movables, was  given by the parliament, in return for this indulgence. The king issued  writs anew to the sheriffs, enjoining the observance of the charter; but  he inserted a remarkable clause in the writs, that those who paid not  the fifteenth should not for the future be entitled to the benefit of  those liberties.[***]         * M. Paris, p. 217, 218, 259. Ann. Waverl. p. 187. Chron.       Dunst. vol. i. p. 129.         ** M. West. p. 282.         *** Clause ix. H. 3, m. 9, and m. 6, d.    The low state into which the crown was fallen, made it requisite for a  good minister to be attentive to the preservation of the royal  prerogatives, as well as to the security of public liberty. Hubert  applied to the pope, who had always great authority in the kingdom, and  was now considered as its superior lord, and desired him to issue a  bull, declaring the king to be of full age, and entitled to exercise in  person all the acts of royalty.[*] In consequence of this declaration,  the justiciary resigned into Henry's hands the two important fortresses  of the Tower and Dover Castle, which had been intrusted to his custody;  and he required the other barons to imitate his example. They refused  compliance: the earls of Chester and Albemarle, John Constable of  Chester, John de Lacy, Brian de l'Isle, and William de Cantel, with some  others, even formed a conspiracy to surprise London, and met in arms at  Waltham with that intention: but finding the king prepared for defence,  they desisted from their enterprise. When summoned to court in order to  answer for their conduct, they scrupled not to appear, and to confess  the design: but they told the king that they had no bad intentions  against his person, but only against Hubert de Burgh, whom they were  determined to remove from his office.[**] They appeared too formidable  to be chastised; and they were so little discouraged by the failure of  their first enterprise, that they again met in arms at Leicester, in  order to seize the king, who then resided at Northampton: but Henry,  informed of their purpose, took care to be so well armed and attended,  that the barons found it dangerous to make the attempt; and they sat  down and kept Christmas in his neighborhood.[***] The archbishop and the  prelates, finding every thing tend towards a civil war, interposed with  their authority, and threatened the barons with the sentence of  excommunication, if they persisted in detaining the king's castles. This  menace at last prevailed: most of the fortresses were surrendered;  though the barons complained that Hubert's castles were soon after  restored to him, while the king still kept theirs in his own custody.  There are said to have been one thousand one hundred and fifteen castles  at that time in England.[****]         * M. Paris, p. 220.         ** Chron. Dunst. vol. i. p. 137.         *** M. Paris, p. 221. Chron. Dunst. vol. i. p. 138.         **** Coke's Comment on Magna Charta, chap. 17.    It must be acknowledged that the influence of the prelates and the  clergy was often of great service to the public.    Though the religion of that age can merit no better name than that of  superstition, it served to unite together a body of men who had great  sway over the people, and who kept the community from falling to pieces,  by the factions and independent power of the nobles. And what was of  great importance, it threw a mighty authority into the hands of men, who  by their profession were averse to arms and violence, who tempered by  their mediation the general disposition towards military enterprises;  and who still maintained, even amidst the shock of arms, those secret  links, without which it is impossible for human society to subsist.    Notwithstanding these intestine commotions in England, and the  precarious authority of the crown, Henry was obliged to carry on war  in France; and he employed to that purpose the fifteenth which had been  granted him by parliament. Lewis VIII., who had succeeded to his father  Philip, instead of complying with Henry's claim, who demanded the  restitution of Normandy and the other provinces wrested from England,  made an irruption into Poictou, took Rochelle[*] after a long siege,  and seemed determined to expel the English from the few provinces  which still remained to them. Henry sent over his uncle, the earl of  Salisbury, together with his brother, Prince Richard, to whom he had  granted the earldom of Cornwall, which had escheated to the crown.  Salisbury stopped the progress of Lewis's arms, and retained the  Poictevin and Gascon vassals in their allegiance: but no military action  of any moment was performed on either side. The earl of Cornwall, after  two years' stay in Guienne, returned to England.         * Rymer, vol i. p. 269. Trivet, p. 179.    {1227.} This prince was nowise turbulent or factious in his disposition:  his ruling passion was to amass money, in which he succeeded so well as  to become the richest subject in Christendom: yet his attention to gain  threw him sometimes into acts of violence, and gave disturbance to  the government. There was a manor, which had formerly belonged to the  earldom of Cornwall but had been granted to Waleran de Ties, before  Richard had been invested with that dignity, and while the earldom  remained in the crown. Richard claimed this manor, and expelled the  proprietor by force: Waleran complained: the king ordered his brother to  do justice to the man, and restore him to his rights: the earl said that  he would not submit to these orders, till the cause should be decided  against him by the judgment of his peers: Henry replied, that it was  first necessary to reinstate Waleran in possession, before the cause  could be tried; and he reiterated his orders to the earl.[*] We may  judge of the state of the government, when this affair had nearly  produced a civil war The earl of Cornwall, finding Henry peremptory in  his commands, associated himself with the young earl of Pembroke who  had married his sister, and who was displeased on account of the  king's requiring him to deliver up some royal castles which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19213"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol. I., Part C. (#3)"],[1,"it, future  incidents would open the way for the decision.    But even after all these precautions, the king was so little satisfied  with his own title, that in the following year, he applied to papal  authority for a confirmation of it; and as the court of Rome gladly laid  hold of all opportunities which the imprudence, weakness, or necessities  of princes afforded it to extend its influence, Innocent VIII., the  reigning pope, readily granted a bull, in whatever terms the king  was pleased to desire. All Henry's titles, by succession, marriage,  parliamentary choice, even conquest, are there enumerated; and to the  whole the sanction of religion is added; excommunication is denounced  against every one who should either disturb him in the present  possession, or the heirs of his body in the future succession of the  crown; and from this penalty no criminal, except in the article of  death, could be absolved but by the pope himself, or his special  commissioners. It is difficult to imagine that the security derived from  this bull could be a compensation for the defect which it betrayed in  Henry's title, and for the danger of thus inviting the pope to interpose  in these concerns.    It was natural, and even laudable in Henry to reverse the attainders  which had passed against the partisans of the house of Lancaster:  but the revenges which he exercised against the adherents of the York  family, to which he was so soon to be allied, cannot be considered in  the same light. Yet the parliament, at his instigation, passed an act  of attainder against the late king himself, against the duke of Norfolk,  the earl of Surrey, Viscount Lovel, the lords Zouche and Ferrars of  Chartley, Sir Walter and Sir James Harrington, Sir William Berkeley,  Sir Humphrey Stafford, Catesby, and about twenty other gentlemen who  had fought on Richard's side in the battle of Bosworth. How men could be  guilty of treason by supporting the king in possession against the  earl of Richmond, who assumed not the title of king, it is not easy to  conceive; and nothing but a servile complaisance in the parliament could  have engaged them to make this stretch of justice. Nor was it a small  mortification to the people in general, to find that the king, prompted  either by avarice or resentment could, in the very beginning of his  reign, so far violate the cordial union which had previously been  concerted between the parties, and to the expectation of which he had  plainly owed his succession to the throne.    The king, having gained so many points of consequence from the  parliament, thought it not expedient to demand any supply from them,  which the profound peace enjoyed by the nation, and the late forfeiture  of Richard's adherents, seemed to render somewhat superfluous. The  parliament, however, conferred on him during life the duty of tonnage  and poundage, which had been enjoyed in the same manner by some of his  immediate predecessors; and they added, before they broke up, other  money bills of no great moment. The king, on his part, made returns  of grace and favor to his people. He published his royal proclamation,  offering pardon to all such as had taken arms, or formed any attempts  against him, provided they submitted themselves to mercy by a certain  day, and took the usual oath of fealty and allegiance. Upon this  proclamation many came out of their sanctuaries; and the minds of men  were every where much quieted. Henry chose to take wholly to himself  the merit of an act of grace so agreeable to the nation, rather than  communicate it with the parliament, (as was his first intention,) by  passing a bill to that purpose. The earl of Surrey, however, though he  had submitted, and delivered himself into the king's hands, was sent  prisoner to the Tower.    During this parliament, the king also bestowed favors and honors on some  particular persons who were attached to him. Edward Stafford, eldest son  of the duke of Buckingham attainted in the late reign, was restored  to the honors of his family, as well as to his fortune, which was very  ample. This generosity, so unusual in Henry, was the effect of his  gratitude to the memory of Buckingham, who had first concerted the plan  of his elevation, and who by his own ruin had made way for that great  event. Chandos of Brittany was created earl of Bath, Sir Giles Daubeny,  Lord Daubeny, and Sir Robert Willoughby, Lord Broke. These were all  the titles of nobility conferred by the king during this session of  parliament.[*]         * Polyd. Virg. p. 566    But the ministers whom Henry most trusted and favored were not chosen  from among the nobility, or even from among the laity. John Morton and  Richard Fox, two clergymen persons of industry, vigilance, and capacity,  were the men to whom he chiefly confided his affairs and secret  counsels. They had shared with him all his former dangers and  distresses; and he now took care to make them participate in his good  fortune. They were both called to the privy council; Morton was restored  to the bishopric of Ely, Fox was created bishop of Exeter. The former,  soon after, upon the death of Bourchier, was raised to the see of  Canterbury. The latter was made privy seal; and successively bishop  of Bath and Wells, Durham, and Winchester. For Henry, as Lord Bacon  observes, loved to employ and advance prelates; because, having rich  bishoprics to bestow, it was easy for him to reward their services: and  it was his maxim to raise them by slow steps, and make them first pass  through the interior sees.[*] He probably expected that, as they were  naturally more dependent on him than the nobility, who during that age  enjoyed possessions and jurisdictions dangerous to royal authority, so  the prospect of further elevation would render them still more active in  his service, and more obsequious to his commands.         * Bacon, p. 582.    {1486.} In presenting the bill of tonnage and poundage, the parliament,  anxious to preserve the legal, undisputed succession to the crown, had  petitioned Henry, with demonstrations of the greatest zeal, to espouse  the princess Elizabeth; but they covered their true reason under the  dutiful pretence of their desire to have heirs of his body. He now  thought in earnest of satisfying the minds of his people in that  particular. His marriage was celebrated at London; and that with  greater appearance of universal joy than either his first entry or his  coronation. Henry remarked with much displeasure this general favor  borne to the house of York. The suspicions which arose from it not only  disturbed his tranquillity during his whole reign, but bred disgust  towards his consort herself, and poisoned all his domestic enjoyments.  Though virtuous, amiable, and obsequious to the last degree, she never  met with a proper return of affection, or even of complaisance, from her  husband; and the malignant ideas of faction still, in his sullen mind,  prevailed over all the sentiments of conjugal tenderness.    The king had been carried along with such a tide of success ever since  his arrival in England, that he thought nothing could withstand the  fortune and authority which attended him.    He now resolved to make a progress into the north, where the friends of  the house of York, and even the partisans of Richard, were numerous, in  hopes of curing, by his presence and conversation, the prejudices of  the malecontents. When he arrived at Nottingham, he heard that Viscount  Lovel, with Sir Humphrey Stafford, and Thomas his brother, had secretly  withdrawn themselves from their sanctuary at Colchester: but this news  appeared not to him of such importance as to stop his journey; and he  proceeded forward to York. He there heard that the Staffords had levied  an army, and were marching to besiege the city of Worcester; and that  Lovel, at the head of three or four thousand men, was approaching to  attack him in York. Henry was not dismayed with this intelligence. His  active courage, full of resources, immediately prompted him to find  the proper remedy. Though surrounded with enemies in these disaffected  counties, he assembled a small body of troops, in whom he could confide;  and he put them under the command of the duke of Bedford. He joined to  them all his own attendants; but he found that this hasty armament was  more formidable by their spirit and their zealous attachment to him,  than by the arms or military stores with which they were provided. He  therefore gave Bedford orders not to approach the enemy; but previously  to try every proper expedient to disperse them. Bedford published a  general promise of pardon to the rebels, which had a greater effect  on their leader than on his followers. Lovel, who had undertaken an  enterprise that exceeded his courage and capacity, was so terrified  with the fear of desertion among his troops, that he suddenly withdrew  himself; and after lurking some time in Lancashire, he made his escape  into Flanders, where he was protected by the duchess of Burgundy. His  army submitted to the king's clemency; and the other rebels, hearing of  this success, raised the siege of Worcester, and dispersed themselves.  The Staffords took sanctuary in the church of Colnham, a village near  Abingdon; but as it was found that this church had not the privilege  of giving protection to rebels, they were taken thence; the elder was  executed at Tyburn; the younger, pleading that he had been misled by his  brother, obtained a pardon.[*]         * Polyd. Virg. p. 569.    Henry's joy for this success was followed, some time after, by the birth  of a prince, to whom he gave the name of Arthur in memory of the famous  British king of that name, from whom it was pretended the family of  Tudor derived its descent.    Though Henry had been able to defeat this hasty rebellion raised by  the relics of Richard's partisans, his government was become in general  unpopular: the source of "]]]
