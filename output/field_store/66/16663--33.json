Tapestry needles, similar to these, but with blunt points, are  useful for canvas work and darned netting. For gold work a special  needle can be procured with sharp point and long wide eye. A bent needle  makes a crooked stitch; but needles if made of good steel should not  bend; they break if used unfairly. The eye should be cleanly cut, or it  roughens the thread. The needle must be just stout enough to prepare for  the thread an easy passage through the material.    _Scissors._--Three pairs may be necessary; for ordinary work a small  pair with fine sharp points, for gold work small ones with strong points  similar to nail scissors, and for cutting-out purposes a large pair with  one rounded and one sharp point.    _Thimbles._--Steel ones are said to be most serviceable, silver are most  usual; but whatever the material they must be neatly made in order not  to wear the thread.    _Frames._--A common type of frame is shown at fig. 1. It is made in  various sizes; the one here represented measures 18 inches across. It  consists of four pieces of wood, two rollers for the top and base and  two side pieces. Each of the rollers has a piece of webbing securely  nailed along it, and its extremities are pierced with holes to receive  the side pieces. These are formed of two long wooden screws, fitted with  movable nuts, which adjust the width of the frame and the tautness of  the stretched work. The piece of material that is stretched between is  the link that keeps the frame together, for the screw ends fit just  loosely in the holes of the rollers. The side pieces are sometimes made  of flat laths of wood pierced with holes at regular intervals; in these  are inserted metal pins, by means of which the work is kept stretched.  Fig. 9 represents a frame of this type. If the frame is a very large one  it can have a strengthening bar fixed across the centre from roller to  roller.    [Illustration: Fig. 1.]    The frame is most convenient for work when fixed in a stand, although it  can be used leaning against a table or the back of a chair. A very large  frame would be supported upon trestles, but for ordinary purposes, a  stand, such as the one shown in fig. 2, is practical. It consists of two  upright wooden posts, a little over 2 feet in height, which are  connected near the base by a strengthening cross piece. Both this and  the uprights are adjustable; the centre part of the posts is arranged to  slide up and down, and can be fixed at any convenient height by the  insertion of a long metal pin; the width of the cross piece is regulated  in similar fashion, being made firm, by a screw, at the required width,  thus allowing various sized frames to be used in the same stand. The  frame is fixed in place by metal clamps, and a wooden pivot is arranged  so as to permit the stretched work to be inclined at any angle  convenient. Both stand and frame should be well made and of good wood,  for they must be able to stand strain and be perfectly firm and true  when fixed for work.    [Illustration: Fig. 2.]    A small circular frame, such as is shown in fig. 3, is useful for  marking linen or for any small work. This, formed of two hoops fitting  closely one within the other, can be procured in wood, ivory, or bone,  of various sizes, the one illustrated being about 6 inches in diameter.  The material to be worked upon is stretched between these hoops like the  parchment on a drum. These tambour frames, as they are called, are  sometimes fixed into a small stand or fitted with a wooden clamp for  fastening to a table; this frees both hands for work. These tambours  cannot well be recommended; the material is apt to stretch unevenly, and  a worked part, if flattened between the hoops, is liable to be damaged.    [Illustration: Fig. 3.]    The illustration at fig. 4 shows a simple little instrument for making  a twisted cord. It is interesting to note that Etienne Binet, who wrote  on embroidery about 1620, when discussing some necessary equipment for  an embroideress mentions \"_un rouet pour faire les cordons_.\"    There is sometimes a difficulty in procuring the cord just right to suit  the finished work; the texture may be too coarse to put beside fine  embroidery, it may not be a good match, and, even if so at first, it may  fade quite differently from the worked silks. For these and other  reasons it is a safe method to make the cord one's self, possibly with  some materials of the kind already used in the embroidery.    [Illustration: Fig. 4.]    This appliance enables the worker to make any kind of twisted cord; it  is as simple as a toy to handle, and gives excellent results. It is a  metal instrument about 8 inches in height. The three small discs are  wheels, supported on the arms of an upright cross which has a heavy  circular base. These three wheels are connected by a cord with a larger  wheel below that has a handle attached to it. The cord runs in a groove  round the circumference of each wheel, and must be held taut in  position. By turning the handle of the large wheel the three small ones  are set in motion. Three hooks, attached to the axles of the small  wheels, are therefore rotated with them. One end of each ply of the cord  in making is looped on to one of these hooks, the other ends are  attached to three similar hooks fixed into a block of wood which, when  in use, is firmly clamped to the table. Further instruction in the  making of cords is given in Chapter XIII.    [Illustration: Fig. 5.]    To trace the pattern on to the material the following articles may be  required: Indian ink, a small finely-pointed sable brush, a tube of oil  paint, flake white or light red, according to the colour of the ground  material, turpentine, powdered charcoal or white chalk for pounce,  tracing paper, drawing-pins, and a pricker. This last-mentioned tool is  shown in fig. 5. It is about 5 inches long, and is like a needle with  the blunt end fitted into a handle. For rubbing on the pounce some soft  clinging material rolled into a ball is necessary. A piece of old silk  hose tightly rolled up makes an excellent pad for the purpose.    The knife shown in fig. 6 is useful for cutting out at times when the  use of scissors is not practical. It is used in an upright position,  with the point outwards.    [Illustration: Fig. 6.]    A spindle for winding gold thread upon whilst working is shown in fig.  7. It is about 8 inches long. A soft padding of cotton thread is first  placed round (between A and B, fig. 7), and the gold thread wound upon  that. The end of the thread passes through the forked piece at the top  on its way to being worked into the material. The use of this or some  similar appliance enables the worker to avoid much touching of the metal  threads.    A small tool called a piercer is represented by fig. 8; it is used in  gold work; the flat end assists in placing the gold in position, and  also in making the floss silk lie quite flat; the pointed end is used  for piercing holes in the material for passing coarse thread to the  back, and for other purposes. This little tool, made of steel, is about  5 inches in length.    [Illustration: Fig. 7.]    [Illustration: Fig. 8.]      MATERIALS    The surface is a matter of special interest in embroidery work. This  makes the choice of materials of great importance. Besides the question  of appearance, these must be suitable to the purpose, durable, and, if  possible, pleasant to work with and upon. The materials chosen should  be the best of their kind, for time and labour are too valuable to be  spent upon poor stuffs; occasionally a piece of old work is seen with  the ground material in shreds and the embroidery upon it in a good state  of preservation, which is a pity, for a newly applied ground of any kind  is never as satisfactory as the original one. Still another plea for the  use of good materials is the moral effect they may have upon the worker,  inciting her to put forth her best efforts in using them.    [Illustration: Fig. 9.]    The purpose to which the work is to be put usually decides the ground  material, besides governing pattern, stitches, and everything else. A  background is chosen, as a rule, to show to advantage and preserve what  is to be placed upon it, though sometimes it is the other way about, and  the pattern is planned to suit an already existing ground.    A background must take its right place, and not be too much in evidence,  although if of the right kind it may be full of interest. There are,  roughly speaking, three ways of treating the ground, leaving the  material just as it is, covering part of it with stitching, or working  entirely over it.    If there is no work upon the ground the choice of material becomes more  important. Texture, colour, tone, and possibly pattern, have all to be  considered, though the problem is often best solved by the selection of  a plain white linen. The question of texture is sometimes one of its  suitability for stitching upon; colour and tone may be of all kinds and  degrees from white to black; these two, as a rule, being particularly  happy ones. If the ground stuff is patterned, as in the case of a  damasked silk, it must be specially chosen to suit the work to be placed  upon it; small diaper patterns are frequently very good, since they  break up the surface pleasantly without being too evident.    Linen, which well answers all the usual requirements, is, for this  reason, very frequently chosen for a ground material. It can be procured  in great variety, the handmade linens being the best of all. Of kinds  besides the ordinary are twilled linens, of which one named Kirriemuir  twill is similar to the material used in the fine old embroidered  curtains. Some damask linens look very well as backgrounds for  embroidery; the pattern is sometimes a slightly raised diaper,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20387"],[0,"A Thin Ghost and Others (#3)"],[1,"or four times, he suddenly turned his head to the left and  looked over his shoulder. It was then alive with a terrible expression  of listening fear. No one saw him go away: and no one could find him  that evening. All night the gale buffeted the high windows of the  church, and howled over the upland and roared through the woodland. It  was useless to search in the open: no voice of shouting or cry for  help could possibly be heard. All that Dr. Ashton could do was to warn  the people about the college, and the town constables, and to sit up,  on the alert for any news, and this he did. News came early next  morning, brought by the sexton, whose business it was to open the  church for early prayers at seven, and who sent the maid rushing  upstairs with wild eyes and flying hair to summon her master. The two  men dashed across to the south door of the minster, there to find Lord  Saul clinging desperately to the great ring of the door, his head sunk  between his shoulders, his stockings in rags, his shoes gone, his legs  torn and bloody.    This was what had to be told to Lord Kildonan, and this really ends  the first part of the story. The tomb of Frank Sydall and of the Lord  Viscount Saul, only child and heir to William Earl of Kildonan, is  one: a stone altar tomb in Whitminster churchyard.    Dr. Ashton lived on for over thirty years in his prebendal house, I do  not know how quietly, but without visible disturbance. His successor  preferred a house he already owned in the town, and left that of the  senior prebendary vacant. Between them these two men saw the  eighteenth century out and the nineteenth in; for Mr. Hindes, the  successor of Ashton, became prebendary at nine-and-twenty and died at  nine-and-eighty. So that it was not till 1823 or 1824 that any one  succeeded to the post who intended to make the house his home. The man  who did was Dr. Henry Oldys, whose name may be known to some of my  readers as that of the author of a row of volumes labelled _Oldys's  Works_, which occupy a place that must be honoured, since it is so  rarely touched, upon the shelves of many a substantial library.    Dr. Oldys, his niece, and his servants took some months to transfer  furniture and books from his Dorsetshire parsonage to the quadrangle  of Whitminster, and to get everything into place. But eventually the  work was done, and the house (which, though untenanted, had always  been kept sound and weather-tight) woke up, and like Monte Cristo's  mansion at Auteuil, lived, sang, and bloomed once more. On a certain  morning in June it looked especially fair, as Dr. Oldys strolled in  his garden before breakfast and gazed over the red roof at the minster  tower with its four gold vanes, backed by a very blue sky, and very  white little clouds.    \"Mary,\" he said, as he seated himself at the breakfast table and laid  down something hard and shiny on the cloth, \"here's a find which the  boy made just now. You'll be sharper than I if you can guess what it's  meant for.\" It was a round and perfectly smooth tablet--as much as an  inch thick--of what seemed clear glass. \"It is rather attractive at  all events,\" said Mary: she was a fair woman, with light hair and  large eyes, rather a devotee of literature. \"Yes,\" said her uncle, \"I  thought you'd be pleased with it. I presume it came from the house: it  turned up in the rubbish-heap in the corner.\" \"I'm not sure that I do  like it, after all,\" said Mary, some minutes later. \"Why in the world  not, my dear?\" \"I don't know, I'm sure. Perhaps it's only fancy.\"  \"Yes, only fancy and romance, of course. What's that book, now--the  name of that book, I mean, that you had your head in all yesterday?\"  \"_The Talisman_, Uncle. Oh, if this should turn out to be a talisman,  how enchanting it would be!\" \"Yes, _The Talisman_: ah, well, you're  welcome to it, whatever it is: I must be off about my business. Is all  well in the house? Does it suit you? Any complaints from the servants'  hall?\" \"No, indeed, nothing could be more charming. The only _soupcon_  of a complaint besides the lock of the linen closet, which I told you  of, is that Mrs. Maple says she cannot get rid of the sawflies out of  that room you pass through at the other end of the hall. By the way,  are you sure you like your bedroom? It is a long way off from any one  else, you know.\" \"Like it? To be sure I do; the further off from you,  my dear, the better. There, don't think it necessary to beat me:  accept my apologies. But what are sawflies? will they eat my coats? If  not, they may have the room to themselves for what I care. We are not  likely to be using it.\" \"No, of course not. Well, what she calls  sawflies are those reddish things like a daddy-longlegs, but  smaller,[1] and there are a great many of them perching about that  room, certainly. I don't like them, but I don't fancy they are  mischievous.\" \"There seem to be several things you don't like this  fine morning,\" said her uncle, as he closed the door. Miss Oldys  remained in her chair looking at the tablet, which she was holding in  the palm of her hand. The smile that had been on her face faded slowly  from it and gave place to an expression of curiosity and almost  strained attention. Her reverie was broken by the entrance of Mrs.  Maple, and her invariable opening, \"Oh, Miss, could I speak to you a  minute?\"    A letter from Miss Oldys to a friend in Lichfield, begun a day or two  before, is the next source for this story. It is not devoid of traces  of the influence of that leader of female thought in her day, Miss  Anna Seward, known to some as the Swan of Lichfield.    \"My sweetest Emily will be rejoiced to hear that we are at length--my  beloved uncle and myself--settled in the house that now calls us  master--nay, master and mistress--as in past ages it has called so  many others. Here we taste a mingling of modern elegance and hoary  antiquity, such as has never ere now graced life for either of us. The  town, small as it is, affords us some reflection, pale indeed, but  veritable, of the sweets of polite intercourse: the adjacent country  numbers amid the occupants of its scattered mansions some whose polish  is annually refreshed by contact with metropolitan splendour, and  others whose robust and homely geniality is, at times, and by way of  contrast, not less cheering and acceptable. Tired of the parlours and  drawing-rooms of our friends, we have ready to hand a refuge from the  clash of wits or the small talk of the day amid the solemn beauties of  our venerable minster, whose silvern chimes daily 'knoll us to  prayer,' and in the shady walks of whose tranquil graveyard we muse  with softened heart, and ever and anon with moistened eye, upon the  memorials of the young, the beautiful, the aged, the wise, and the  good.\"    Here there is an abrupt break both in the writing and the style.    \"But my dearest Emily, I can no longer write with the care which you  deserve, and in which we both take pleasure. What I have to tell you  is wholly foreign to what has gone before. This morning my uncle  brought in to breakfast an object which had been found in the garden;  it was a glass or crystal tablet of this shape (a little sketch is  given), which he handed to me, and which, after he left the room,  remained on the table by me. I gazed at it, I know not why, for some  minutes, till called away by the day's duties; and you will smile  incredulously when I say that I seemed to myself to begin to descry  reflected in it objects and scenes which were not in the room where I  was. You will not, however, be surprised that after such an experience  I took the first opportunity to seclude myself in my room with what I  now half believed to be a talisman of mickle might. I was not  disappointed. I assure you, Emily, by that memory which is dearest to  both of us, that what I went through this afternoon transcends the  limits of what I had before deemed credible. In brief, what I saw,  seated in my bedroom, in the broad daylight of summer, and looking  into the crystal depth of that small round tablet, was this. First, a  prospect, strange to me, of an enclosure of rough and hillocky grass,  with a grey stone ruin in the midst, and a wall of rough stones about  it. In this stood an old, and very ugly, woman in a red cloak and  ragged skirt, talking to a boy dressed in the fashion of maybe a  hundred years ago. She put something which glittered into his hand,  and he something into hers, which I saw to be money, for a single coin  fell from her trembling hand into the grass. The scene passed--I  should have remarked, by the way, that on the rough walls of the  enclosure I could distinguish bones, and even a skull, lying in a  disorderly fashion. Next, I was looking upon two boys; one the figure  of the former vision, the other younger. They were in a plot of  garden, walled round, and this garden, in spite of the difference in  arrangement, and the small size of the trees, I could clearly  recognize as being that upon which I now look from my window. The boys  were engaged in some curious play, it seemed. Something was  smouldering on the ground. The elder placed his hands upon it, and  then raised them in what I took to be an attitude of prayer: and I  saw, and started at seeing, that on them were deep stains of blood.  The sky above was overcast. The same boy now turned his face towards  the wall of the garden, and beckoned with both his raised hands, and  as he did so I was conscious that some moving objects were becoming  visible over the top of the wall--whether heads or other parts of some  animal or human forms I could not tell. Upon the instant the elder boy  turned sharply, seized the arm of the younger (who all this time had  been poring over what lay on the ground), and both hurried off. I then  saw blood upon the grass, a little pile of bricks, and what I thought  were black feathers scattered about. That scene closed, and the next  "]]]
