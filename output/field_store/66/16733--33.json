The fleece of  sheep, the hair of the goat and camel, silk, furs, and skins are the  chief animal products. The principal vegetable fibers are cotton, flax,  ramie, jute, and hemp.    [Sidenote: Chief Fibers]    Cotton linen, wool, and silk have heretofore formed the foundation of  all textiles and are the principal fibers used for clothing materials.  Ramie or China grass and pineapple fibers are sometimes used as  adulterants in the manufacture of silk. When woven alone, they give soft  silky textiles of great strength and beauty.      COTTON    [Illustration: PRODUCTION OF COTTON]    Cotton is now our chief vegetable fiber, the yearly crop being over six  billion pounds, of which the United States raises three-fourths. Texas  is the largest producer, followed by Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi.  The remainder of the world supply comes chiefly from India, Egypt,  Russia, and Brazil. The Hindoos were the first ancient people to make  extensive use of the cotton fiber. Not until the invention of the cotton  gin by Eli Whitney in 1794 did the cotton begin to reach its present  importance. Only four or five pounds of the fiber could be separated by  hand from the seed by a week's labor. The modern saw gins turn out over  five thousand pounds daily.    [Sidenote: Native Home]    Cotton is the white downy covering of the seed of several special of  cotton of cotton plant. It is a native of many parts of the world, being  found by Columbus growing in the West Indies and on the main land, by  Cortez in Mexico, and Pizarro in Peru.      [Illustration: COTTON FIBER ATTACHED TO SEED]      [Sidenote: Sea Island Cotton]    The value of cotton depends upon the strength, and evenness of the  fiber. In ordinary cotton the individual fiber is about an inch in  length. The sea island cotton grown chiefly on the islands off the coast  of Georgia, Carolina, and Florida is the most valuable variety, having a  fine fiber, one and one-half to two inches in length. Some of the  Egyptian cotton belongs to this species. Sea island cotton is used  chiefly for fine laces, thread and knit goods and for the finest lawns  and muslins.    [Sidenote: Upland Cotton]    The short fiber or upland cotton is the most common and useful variety.  It is grown in Georgia, North and South Carolina and Alabama. Texas  cotton is similar to upland, but sometimes is harsh with shorter fiber.  Gulf cotton occupies a position between upland and sea island cotton.      [Illustration: UPLAND COTTON PLANT WITH FULLY DEVELOPED BOLES    From Bulletin No. 31, Georgia Experiment Station.]      [Illustration: COTTON BOLE FULLY DEVELOPED    From Year Book of the Department of Agriculture, 1903.]      [Illustration: BOLE OPENED, COTTON READY FOR PICKING    Year Book of 1903.]      The Brazilian and Peruvian cotton yields a long staple and is sometimes  used to adulterate silk and other fibers. Some varieties of this cotton  are harsh and wooly and are prized for use in mixing with wool.    [Sidenote: Nankin Cotton]    The Nankin cotton grown in China and India and in the southwestern part  of Louisiana is characterized by its yellow color. It is used in weaving  cloth of various kinds in the \"fireside industries\" which have become  popular in the United States and England.      [Illustration: COTTON FIBERS    _A A_--Unripe Fibers; _B B_--Half-ripe Fibers; _C C_--Ripe Fibers.]      [Sidenote: Spinning Qualities]    Very fine yarn can be spun from cotton because of the spiral character  of the fibers. This twist of the fibers is peculiar to cotton, being  present in no other animal or vegetable fiber. On account of this twist,  cotton cloths are much more elastic in character than those woven from  linen, the fibers of which are stiff and straight.    After the removal of the seed, no other fiber is so free from  impurities--5 per cent is the loss sustained by cleaning and bleaching.  In its natural condition, cotton will not dye readily because of a waxy  substance on the surface of the fibers. This must be removed by washing.    [Sidenote: Picking and Ginning]    Cotton should be picked only when it is fully ripe when the pods are  fully burst and the fibers expanded. The unripe fiber is glassy, does  not attain its full strength and resists the dye. After picking, the  cotton is sent to the ginning factory to have the seed removed. It is  then pressed into bales by hydraulic presses, five hundred pounds being  the standard bale in the United States.      [Illustration: COTTON BALES]      [Sidenote: Physical Characteristics]    Purified bleached cotton is nearly pure cellulose. It resists the action  of alkalis well, but is harmed by hot, strong acids, or if acid is  allowed to dry on the fabric. It is not harmed by high temperature, and  so may be ironed with a hot iron.      [Illustration: WOOL FIBER AND SUBSTITUTES    1. South American Wool; 2. Noil from the Same; 3. Tangled Waste; 4.  Waste Combed Out; 5. Lap Waste; 6. Shoddy.]      WOOL    [Sidenote: Character of Fiber]    Wool is the most important animal fiber. Strictly speaking the name  applies only to the hairy covering of sheep, but the hair of certain  goats and of camels is generally classified under the same terms. The  wool fiber is distinguished by its scale-like surface which gives it its  felting and spinning properties. Hair as distinguished from wool has  little or no scaly structure being in general a smooth filament with no  felting properties and spinning only with great difficulty. Fur is the  undergrowth found on most fur-bearing animals and has in a modified way  the scaly structure and felting properties of wool.      [Illustration: MICROSCOPIC APPEARANCE OF WOOL FIBERS]      [Sidenote: Value for Clothing]    The great value of wool as a fiber lies in the fact that it is strong,  elastic, soft, very susceptible to dye stuffs and being woven, furnishes  a great number of air spaces, rendering clothing made from it very warm  and light.    [Sidenote: Quality of Wool]    Climate, breed, and food influence the quality of the wool. Where the  pasturage is barren and rocky, the wool is apt to be coarse.      [Illustration: MERINO RAMS    The Variety of Sheep Giving the Finest Wool.]      [Sidenote: Varieties of Sheep]    There are supposed to be about thirty distinct varieties of sheep,  nearly half of which are natives of Asia, one-third of Africa, and only  four coming from Europe, and two from America. Wool is divided into two  general classes--long and short staple, according to the average length  of fiber. The long fiber wool is commonly carded, combed and spun into  _worsted_ yarn. The short fiber is usually carded and spun into woolen  yarn. The short fiber obtained in combing long staple wool is called  \"noil.\" It is used for woolens.    [Sidenote: Goat Wools]    Alpaca, Vicuna and Llama wools are obtained from animals which are  native to the mountains of Peru and Chile. The Angora goat, originally  from Asia Minor, furnishes the mohair of commerce. This fiber does not  resemble the hairs of common goats in any respect. It is a very  beautiful fiber of silky luster, which constitutes its chief value.      [Illustration: ANGORA GOATS]      [Sidenote: Fur]    The fur of beavers and rabbits can be and is used in manufacture, either  spun into yarn or made into felt. The fibers of both animals enter  largely into the manufacture of felt hats.    [Sidenote: Sorting Wool]    The fleece of sheep after being sheared is divided into different parts  or _sorted_, according to the quality of the wool, the best wool coming  from the sides of the animal.      [Illustration: WOOL FIBERS    _a_--Medium Wool; _b_--Camel's Hair; _c_--Diseased Fiber; _d_--Merino  Wool; _e_--Mohair.]      [Sidenote: Scouring Wool]    As it comes from the sheep, the wool contains many substances besides  the wool fiber which must be removed before dyeing or spinning. This  cleansing is called _scouring_. Before scouring, the wool is usually  dusted by machines to remove all loose dirt. The scouring must be done  by the mildest means possible in order to preserve the natural  fluffiness and brilliancy of the fiber. The chief impurity is the wool  grease or \"yolk\" which is secreted by the skin glands to lubricate the  fiber and prevent it from matting.      [Illustration: ONE METHOD OF WOOL SORTING    1--The Best Grade; 2--Lowest Grade; 3--Fair; 4--Medium Grade.]      [Sidenote: Scouring Agents]    In the scouring of wool, soap is the principal agent. Soft soap made  from caustic potash is generally used as it is less harmful than  ordinary hard soda soap. Potassium carbonate--\"pearl ash\"--is often used  in connection with the soap. If the water for scouring is hard, it is  softened with pearl ash. The temperature of wash water is never allowed  to go above 120 deg. F. The scoured wool weighs from a little over a half to  one-third or less of the weight of the fleece.    [Sidenote: Hydroscopic Moisture]    Wool has the remarkable property of absorbing up to 30 per cent or more  of its weight of water and yet not feel perceptibly damp to the touch.  This is called \"hydroscopic moisture.\" To this property wool owes its  superiority as a textile for underclothing.      [Illustration: WOOL SORTING]      The thoroughly cleansed fiber is made up chiefly of the chemical  substance keratin, being similar in composition to horn and feathers. In  burning it gives off a characteristic disagreeable odor. It is a  substance very weakly acid in its nature, for which reason it combines  readily with many dyes. Wool resists the action of acids very well, but  is much harmed by the alkalis, being dissolved completely by a warm  solution of caustic soda. High temperature harms wool.      FLAX    Next to wool and cotton, flax is used most largely in our textile  manufactures. The linen fiber consists of the bast cells of certain  species of flax grown in Europe, Africa, and the United States.
