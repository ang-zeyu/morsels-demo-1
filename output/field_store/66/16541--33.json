[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1872"],[0,"The Red House Mystery (#3)"],[1,"next arrival. This was Bill Beverly, a  cheerful young man in white flannel trousers and a blazer.    \"Hallo, Major,\" he said as he came in, \"how's the gout?\"    \"It isn't gout,\" said the Major gruffly.    \"Well, whatever it is.\"    The Major grunted.    \"I make a point of being polite at breakfast,\" said Bill, helping  himself largely to porridge. \"Most people are so rude. That's why I  asked you. But don't tell me if it's a secret. Coffee?\" he added, as he  poured himself out a cup.    \"No, thanks. I never drink till I've finished eating.\"    \"Quite right, Major; it's only manners.\" He sat down opposite to the  other. \"Well, we've got a good day for our game. It's going to be dashed  hot, but that's where Betty and I score. On the fifth green, your old  wound, the one you got in that frontier skirmish in '43, will begin to  trouble you; on the eighth, your liver, undermined by years of curry,  will drop to pieces; on the twelfth--\"    \"Oh, shut up, you ass!\"    \"Well, I'm only warning you. Hallo; good morning, Miss Norris. I was  just telling the Major what was going to happen to you and him this  morning. Do you want any assistance, or do you prefer choosing your own  breakfast?\"    \"Please don't get up,\" said Miss Norris. \"I'll help myself. Good  morning, Major.\" She smiled pleasantly at him. The Major nodded.    \"Good morning. Going to be hot.\"    \"As I was telling him,\" began Bill, \"that's where--Hallo, here's Betty.  Morning, Cayley.\"    Betty Calladine and Cayley had come in together. Betty was the  eighteen-year-old daughter of Mrs. John Calladine, widow of the painter,  who was acting hostess on this occasion for Mark. Ruth Norris took  herself seriously as an actress and, on her holidays, seriously as a  golfer. She was quite competent as either. Neither the Stage Society nor  Sandwich had any terrors for her.    \"By the way, the car will be round at 10.30,\" said Cayley, looking up  from his letters. \"You're lunching there, and driving back directly  afterwards. Isn't that right?\"    \"I don't see why we shouldn't have--two rounds,\" said Bill hopefully.    \"Much too hot in the afternoon,\" said the Major. \"Get back comfortably  for tea.\"    Mark came in. He was generally the last. He greeted them and sat down to  toast and tea. Breakfast was not his meal. The others chattered gently  while he read his letters.    \"Good God!\" said Mark suddenly.    There was an instinctive turning of heads towards him. \"I beg your  pardon, Miss Norris. Sorry, Betty.\"    Miss Norris smiled her forgiveness. She often wanted to say it herself,  particularly at rehearsals.    \"I say, Cay!\" He was frowning to himself--annoyed, puzzled. He held up a  letter and shook it. \"Who do you think this is from?\"    Cayley, at the other end of the table, shrugged his shoulders. How could  he possibly guess?    \"Robert,\" said Mark.    \"Robert?\" It was difficult to surprise Cayley. \"Well?\"    \"It's all very well to say 'well?' like that,\" said Mark peevishly.  \"He's coming here this afternoon.\"    \"I thought he was in Australia, or somewhere.\"    \"Of course. So did I.\" He looked across at Rumbold. \"Got any brothers,  Major?\"    \"No.\"    \"Well, take my advice, and don't have any.\"    \"Not likely to now,\" said the Major.    Bill laughed. Miss Norris said politely: \"But you haven't any brothers,  Mr. Ablett?\"    \"One,\" said Mark grimly. \"If you're back in time you'll see him this  afternoon. He'll probably ask you to lend him five pounds. Don't.\"    Everybody felt a little uncomfortable.    \"I've got a brother,\" said Bill helpfully, \"but I always borrow from  him.\"    \"Like Robert,\" said Mark.    \"When was he in England last?\" asked Cayley.    \"About fifteen years ago, wasn't it? You'd have been a boy, of course.\"    \"Yes, I remember seeing him once about then, but I didn't know if he had  been back since.\"    \"No. Not to my knowledge.\" Mark, still obviously upset, returned to his  letter.    \"Personally,\" said Bill, \"I think relations are a great mistake.\"    \"All the same,\" said Betty a little daringly, \"it must be rather fun  having a skeleton in the cupboard.\"    Mark looked up, frowning.    \"If you think it's fun, I'll hand him over to you, Betty. If he's  anything like he used to be, and like his few letters have been--well,  Cay knows.\"    Cayley grunted.    \"All I knew was that one didn't ask questions about him.\"    It may have been meant as a hint to any too curious guest not to ask  more questions, or a reminder to his host not to talk too freely in  front of strangers, although he gave it the sound of a mere statement of  fact. But the subject dropped, to be succeeded by the more fascinating  one of the coming foursome. Mrs. Calladine was driving over with the  players in order to lunch with an old friend who lived near the links,  and Mark and Cayley were remaining at home--on affairs. Apparently  \"affairs\" were now to include a prodigal brother. But that need not make  the foursome less enjoyable.    At about the time when the Major (for whatever reasons) was fluffing  his tee-shot at the sixteenth, and Mark and his cousin were at their  business at the Red House, an attractive gentleman of the name of Antony  Gillingham was handing up his ticket at Woodham station and asking the  way to the village. Having received directions, he left his bag with the  station-master and walked off leisurely. He is an important person to  this story, so that it is as well we should know something about him  before letting him loose in it. Let us stop him at the top of the hill  on some excuse, and have a good look at him.    The first thing we realize is that he is doing more of the looking  than we are. Above a clean-cut, clean-shaven face, of the type usually  associated with the Navy, he carries a pair of grey eyes which seem  to be absorbing every detail of our person. To strangers this look is  almost alarming at first, until they discover that his mind is very  often elsewhere; that he has, so to speak, left his eyes on guard, while  he himself follows a train of thought in another direction. Many people  do this, of course; when, for instance, they are talking to one person  and trying to listen to another; but their eyes betray them. Antony's  never did.    He had seen a good deal of the world with those eyes, though never as a  sailor. When at the age of twenty-one he came into his mother's money,  400 pounds a year, old Gillingham looked up from the \"Stockbreeders'  Gazette\" to ask what he was going to do.    \"See the world,\" said Antony.    \"Well, send me a line from America, or wherever you get to.\"    \"Right,\" said Antony.    Old Gillingham returned to his paper. Antony was a younger son, and,  on the whole, not so interesting to his father as the cadets of certain  other families; Champion Birket's, for instance. But, then, Champion  Birket was the best Hereford bull he had ever bred.    Antony, however, had no intention of going further away than London. His  idea of seeing the world was to see, not countries, but people; and to  see them from as many angles as possible. There are all sorts in London  if you know how to look at them. So Antony looked at them--from  various strange corners; from the view-point of the valet, the  newspaper-reporter, the waiter, the shop-assistant. With the  independence of 400 pounds a year behind him, he enjoyed it immensely.  He never stayed long in one job, and generally closed his connection  with it by telling his employer (contrary to all etiquette as understood  between master and servant) exactly what he thought of him. He had  no difficulty in finding a new profession. Instead of experience and  testimonials he offered his personality and a sporting bet. He would  take no wages the first month, and--if he satisfied his employer--double  wages the second. He always got his double wages.    He was now thirty. He had come to Waldheim for a holiday, because  he liked the look of the station. His ticket entitled him to travel  further, but he had always intended to please himself in the matter.  Waldheim attracted him, and he had a suit-case in the carriage with him  and money in his pocket. Why not get out?    The landlady of 'The George' was only too glad to put him up, and  promised that her husband would drive over that afternoon for his  luggage.    \"And you would like some lunch, I expect, sir.\"    \"Yes, but don't give yourself any trouble about it. Cold  anything-you've-got.\"    \"What about beef, sir?\" she asked, as if she had a hundred varieties of  meat to select from, and was offering him her best.    \"That will do splendidly. And a pint of beer.\"    While he was finishing his lunch, the landlord came in to ask about the  luggage. Antony ordered another pint, and soon had him talking.    \"It must be rather fun to keep a country inn,\" he said, thinking that it  was about time he started another profession.    \"I don't know about fun, sir. It gives us a living, and a bit over.\"    \"You ought to take a holiday,\" said Antony, looking at him thoughtfully.    \"Funny thing your saying that,\" said the landlord, with a smile.  \"Another gentleman, over from the Red House, was saying that only  yesterday. Offered to take my place 'n all.\" He laughed rumblingly.    \"The Red House? Not the Red House, Stanton?\"    \"That's right, sir. Stanton's the next station to Waldheim. The Red  House is about a mile from here--Mr. Ablett's.\"    Antony took a letter from his pocket. It was addressed from \"The Red  House, Stanton,\" and signed \"Bill.\"    \"Good old Bill,\" he murmured to himself. \"He's getting on.\"    Antony had met Bill Beverley two years before in a tobacconist's shop.  Gillingham was on one side of the counter and Mr. Beverley on the  other. Something about Bill, his youth and freshness, perhaps, attracted  Antony; and when cigarettes had been ordered, and an address given to  which they were to be sent, he remembered that he had come across an  aunt of Beverley's once at a country-house."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18721"],[0,"The Victim: A Romance of the Real Jefferson Davis (#3)"],[1," lick Spain and England both at Pensacola and didn't he  finish the Red Coats at New Orleans--\"    \"They say his education's poor--\"    \"He knowed enough to make this country cock o' the walk--what more do  they want--damn 'em!\"    \"They say he swears--\"    The Tennesseean roared:    \"Waal, if all the cussin' men vote fur him--he'll sho be elected!\"    \"The real trouble--\" the Major said thoughtfully, \"is what the  scandal-mongers keep saying about his wife--\"    \"He's killed one son-of-a-gun about that already, an' they better let  him alone--\"    \"That's just it, my friend: he killed that skunk in a duel and it's not  the only one he has fought either. Old Hickory's got the temper of the  devil.\"    \"Waal, thar ain't nothin' in them lies about his wife--\"    The Major lifted his hand and moved closer:    \"There's just enough truth at the bottom of it all to give the liars the  chance they need to talk forever--\"    \"I never knowed thar wuz ary grain er truth in hit, at all--\"    \"There is, though,\" the Major interrupted, \"and that's where we're going  to have a big fight on our hands when it comes to the rub. This Lewis  Robards, her first husband, was a quarrelsome cuss. Every man that  looked at his wife, he swore was after her, and if she lifted her eyes,  he was sure she was guilty. There was no divorce law in Virginia and  Robards petitioned the Legislature to pass an Act of Divorce in his  favor. The dog swore in this petition that his wife had deserted him and  was living with Andrew Jackson. He _was_ boarding with her mother, the  widow Donelson. The Legislature passed the Act, but it only authorized  the Courts of the Territory of Kentucky to try the case, and grant the  divorce if the facts were proven.    \"Robards never went to Court with it for over two years, and Jackson,  under the impression that the Legislature had given the divorce, married  Rachel Robards at Natchez in August, 1791.    \"Two years later, the skunk slips into Court and gets his divorce!    \"As quick as Old Hickory heard this, he married her over again. There  was a mighty hullabaloo kicked up about it by the politicians. They  tried to run Jackson out of the country--the little pups who were afraid  of him. He challenged the leader of this pack of hounds, and shot him  dead--\"    \"Served him right, too,\" broke in the Tennesseean, removing his pipe,  with a nod of his shaggy head.    \"But it don't help him on the way to Washington!\" The Major grunted,  suddenly rising and dismissing the subject for the night.    The Boy's curiosity was kindled to see the great man whose name had  filled the world.    The distance to Nashville was quickly covered. The Major pressed  straight through the town without pause and drew rein at the General's  gate.    The welcome they received from their distinguished host was so simple,  so genuine, so real, the Boy's heart went out in loyal admiration.    The house was a big rambling structure of logs, in front of which stood  a stately grove of magnificent forest trees. Behind it stretched the  grain and cotton fields.    Nothing could surpass the unaffected and perfect courtesy with which the  General welcomed his guests. The tall, stately figure, moving with the  unconscious grace of perfect manhood, needed no rules of a dancing  master for his guidance. He had sprung from the common people, but he  was a born leader and ruler of men.    The Boy listened with keen ears to hear him rip out one of those  terrible oaths of which so much had been said. His speech was gentle and  kind, and he asked a blessing at every meal exactly as his own quiet,  dignified father at home. In all the three weeks they remained his  guests not an oath or an ugly word fell from his lips. The Boy wondered  how people could tell such lies.    The General liked boys, too. It was easy to see that. He gave hours of  his time to the games and sports of his adopted son, Andrew Jackson,  Jr., and his two little guests. He got up contests of all sorts. They  raced their ponies. They ran and jumped. They played marbles. They  followed the hounds. And always with them as friend and counselor, the  General, gentle, kind, considerate. The only thing he prohibited was  wrestling.    \"No, boys,\" he said with a frown. \"That's not a good sport for high  spirited youth. To feel the hand of a rival on your body may lead to a  fight.\"    The deep set eyes flashed with the memory of his own hot blooded boyhood  and young manhood.    The General's wife won the Boy's whole heart from the moment he saw her.    \"How could they tell such lies!\" he kept repeating with boyish  indignation. Pure and sweet as the face of his own mother was hers.  Loving, unselfish, tender and thoughtful, she moved through her house  with the gentle step of a ministering angel. The knightly deference with  which the General attended her slightest wish, stirred the Boy's  imagination. He could see him standing erect, pistol in hand, in the  gray dawn of the morning on which he faced the enemy who had slandered  her. He could see the big firm hand grip the pistol's handle in a clasp  of steel as he waited the signal of Death. He wondered what sort of  wound Dickenson's bullet had made in the General's breast. Anyhow, it  had not been fatal. His enemy lived but a few hours.    He set his lips firmly, and repeated the Tennesseean's verdict:    \"Served him right, too.\"    The Boy left the Hermitage under the spell of Old Hickory's personality  for life. He had seen a great man.          IV    THE MONASTERY BELLS      The journey from Nashville to Springfield, Kentucky, was quick and  uneventful. Long before the spire of St. Thomas' church loomed on the  horizon, they passed through the wide, fertile fields of the Dominican  monks. The grim figure of a black friar was directing the harvest of a  sea of golden-yellow wheat. His workmen were sleek negro slaves. Herds  of fat cattle grazed on the hills. A flock of a thousand sheep were  nipping the fresh sweet grass in the valley. They passed a big flour  mill, whose lazy wheel swung in rhythmic unison with the laughing waters  of the creek that watered the rich valley. The monks were vowed to  poverty and self-denial. But their Order was rich in slaves and land, in  mills and herds and flocks and generous harvests.    As the sun sank in a smother of purple and red behind the hills, they  saw the church and monastery. The bells were chanting their call to  evening prayer.    The Boy held his breath in silent ecstasy. He had never heard anything  like it before. It was wonderful--those sweet notes echoing over hill  and valley in the solemn hush of the gathering twilight.    They waited for the priests to emerge from the chapel before making  their presence known. Through the open windows the deep solemn throb of  the organ pealed. The soul of the Boy rose enchanted on new wings whose  power he had never dreamed. Hidden depths were sounded of whose  existence he could not know. There was no organ in the little bare log  church the Baptists had built near his father's farm in Mississippi. His  father and mother were Baptists and of course he was going to be a  Baptist some day. But why didn't they have stained glass windows like  those through which he saw the light now streaming--wonderful flashing  lights, whose colors seemed to pour from the soul of the organ. And why  didn't they have a great organ?    He was going to like these Roman Catholics. He wondered what his mother  would say to that?    It all seemed so familiar, too. Where had he heard those bells? Where  had he heard the peal of that organ and seen the flash of those gorgeous  lights? In the sky at sunset perhaps, and in the rumble of the storm.  Maybe in dreams--and now they had come true.    In a few months, he found himself the only Protestant boy in school and  the smallest of all the scholars. The monks were kind. They seemed  somehow to love him better than the others. Father Wallace reminded him  of his big brother. He was so gentle.    The Boy made up his mind to join the Catholic Church and went straight  to Father Wilson, the venerable head of the college.    The old man smiled pleasantly:    \"And why do you wish this, my son?\"    \"Oh, it's so much more beautiful than the Baptist Church. Besides it's  so much easier--\"    \"Indeed?\"    \"Yes, sir. The Baptists have such a hard time getting religion. They  seek and mourn so long--\"    \"Really?\"    \"Indeed they do--yes, sir--I've seen stubborn sinners mourn all summer  in three protracted meetings and then not come through!\"    \"And you don't like that sort of penance?\"    \"No, sir. I've always dreaded it. And the worst thing is the new  converts have to stand right up in church before all the crowd and tell  their experience out loud. I'd hate that--\"    \"And you like our ways better?\"    \"A great deal better. The Catholics manage things so nicely. All you  have to do is to go to church, learn the catechism and the good priests  do all the rest--\"    \"Oh--I see!\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    Father Wilson laid his wrinkled hand tenderly on the Boy's head:    \"You are very, very young, my son, and you are growing rapidly. What you  really need is good Catholic food. Sit down and have a piece of bread  and cheese with me.\"    The Boy sat down and ate the offered bread and cheese in silence.    \"I can't join, Father Wilson?\" he asked at last.    The priest smiled again:    \"No, my son.\"    \"You don't like me, Father?\" the boy asked wistfully.    \"We like you very much, sir. But we are responsible for the trust your  father and mother have put in us. In God's own time when you are older  and know the full meaning of your act, I should be glad--but not this  way.\"    The Boy was so small, in fact, that a fine old priest in pity for his  tender years had a little bed put in his own room for him to watch the  light and shadows in eager young eyes when homesickness threatened. And  then he talked of the wonders and glory "]]]
