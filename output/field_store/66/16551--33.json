CHAPTER II    CONSCIOUSNESS      We took a glimpse at random into the mental life of an adult  consciousness, and found it very complicated, constantly changing. We  found it packed with shifting material, which, on the surface, seemed to  bear very little relation. We found reason, feeling, and will all  interacting. We found nothing to indicate that a consciousness as simple  as mere _awareness_ might exist. We believe there might be such in the  newborn babe, perhaps even in the baby a month old; but can we prove it?  Let us look within again and see if there are not times of mere, bare  consciousness in our own experience that give us the proof we need.    I have slept deeply all night. It is my usual waking time. Something  from within or from without forces an impression upon my mind, and I  stir, and slowly open my eyes. As yet I have really not seen anything.  With my eyes open my mind still sleeps--but in a few seconds comes a  possessing sense of well-being. Obeying some stimulus, not recognized by  the senses as yet, I begin to stretch and yawn, then close my eyes and  settle down into my pillows as for another nap. I am not aware that I  am I, that I am awake, that I have yawned and stretched. I have a  pleasant, half-dreamy feeling, but could not give it a name. For those  few seconds this is all my world--a pleasant drowsiness, a being  possessed by comfort. My consciousness is mere awareness--a pleasant  awareness of uncomplicated existence. In another moment or two it is a  consciousness of a day's work or pleasure ahead, the necessity of  rising, dressing, planning the day, the alert reaction of pleasure or  displeasure to what it is to bring, the effort to recall the dreams of  sleep--the complicated consciousness of the mature man or woman. But I  started the day with a mental condition close to pure sensation, a vague  feeling of something different than what was just before.    Or this bare consciousness may come in the moment of acute shock, when  the sense of suffering, quite disconnected from its cause, pervades my  entire being; or at the second when I am first \"coming back\" after a  faint, or at the first stepping out from an anesthetic. In these  experiences most of us can recall a very simple mental content, and can  prove to our own satisfaction that there is such a thing as mere  awareness, a consciousness probably close akin to that of the lower  levels of animal life, or to that of the newborn babe when he first  opens his eyes to life.    _Consciousness_, then, in its elements, is the simplest mental reaction  to what the senses bring.    How shall we determine when consciousness exists? What are its tests?    The response of the mind to stimuli, made evident by the body's  reaction, gives the proof of consciousness in man or lower animal.    But what do we mean by a stimulus?    Light stimulates me to close my eyes when first entering its glare from  a dark room, or to open them when it plays upon my eyelids as I sleep  and the morning sun reaches me. It is a stimulus from without.    The fear-thought, which makes my body tremble, my pupils grow wide, and  whitens my cheeks, is a stimulus from within.    An unexpected shot in the woods near-by, which changes the whole trend  of my thinking and startles me into investigating its cause, is a  stimulus from without causing a change within.    A _stimulus_, then, is anything within or without the body that arouses  awareness; and this is usually evidenced by some physical change,  however slight--perhaps only by dilated pupils or an expression of  relief. When we see the reaction of the body to the stimulus we know  there is consciousness. On the other hand, we cannot say that  consciousness is always absent when the usual response does not occur;  for there may be injury to organs accounting for the lack of visible  reaction, while the mind itself may respond. But with due care, in even  such cases, some external symptoms of response can usually be found if  consciousness exists.    We have already realized how complex, intricate, and changing is fully  developed consciousness.      THE UNCONSCIOUS    But the mind of man knows two distinct conditions of activity--the  conscious and the unconscious. Mind is not always wide awake. We  recognize what we call the _conscious_ mind as the ruling force in our  lives. But how many things I do without conscious attention; how often I  find myself deep in an unexplainable mood; how the fragrance of a flower  will sometimes turn the tide of a day for me and make me square my  shoulders and go at my task with renewed vigor; or a casual glimpse of a  face in the street turn my attention away from my errand and settle my  mind into a brown study. Usually I am alert enough to control these  errant reactions, but I am keenly aware of their demands upon my mind,  and frequently it is only with conscious effort that I am kept upon my  way unswerved by them, though not unmoved.    When we realize that nothing that has ever happened in our experience is  forgotten; that nothing once in consciousness altogether drops out, but  is stored away waiting to be used some day--waiting for a voice from the  conscious world to recall it from oblivion--then we grasp the fact that  the quality of present thought or reaction is largely determined by the  sum of all past thinking and acting. Just as my body is the result of  the heritage of many ancestors plus the food I give it and the use to  which I subject it, so my mind's capacity is determined by my  inheritance plus the mental food I give it, plus everything to which I  have subjected it since the day I was born. For it forgets absolutely  nothing.    \"That is not true,\" you say, \"for I have tried desperately to remember  certain incidents, certain lessons learned--and they are _gone_.  Moreover, I cannot remember what happened back there in my babyhood.\"    Ah, but you are mistaken, my friend. For you react to your task today  differently because of the thing which you learned and have \"forgotten.\"  Your mind works differently because of what you disregarded then. \"You\"  have forgotten it, but your brain-cells, your nerve-cells have not; and  you are not quite the same person you would be without that forgotten  experience, or that pressing stimulus, which you never consciously  recognized, but allowed your subconsciousness to accept. Some night you  have a strange, incomprehensible dream. You cannot find its source, but  it is merely the re-enacting of some past sensation or experience of  your own, fantastically arrayed. Some day you stop short in your hurried  walk with a feeling of compulsion which you cannot resist. You know no  reason for it, but some association with this particular spot, or some  vague resemblance, haunts you. You cannot \"place\" it. One day you hit  the tennis-ball at a little different angle than you planned because a  queer thought came unbidden and directed your attention aside. Again,  under terrific stress, with sick body and aching nerves, you go on and  do your stint almost mechanically. You do not know where the strength or  the skill is derived. But your unconscious or subconscious--as you  will--has asserted itself, has usurped the place of the sick conscious,  and enabled you automatically to go on. For we react to the storehouse  of the unconscious even as we do to the conscious.    Remember that the unconscious is simply the latent conscious--what once  was conscious and may be again, but is now buried out of sight.    The mind may be likened to a great sea upon which there are visible a  few islands. The islands represent the conscious thoughts--that  consciousness we use to calculate, to map out our plans, to form our  judgments. This is the mind that for centuries was accepted as all the  mind. But we know that the islands are merely the tops of huge  mountain-ranges formed by the floor of the sea in mighty, permanent  upheaval; that as this sea-floor rises high above its customary level  and thrusts its bulk above the waters into the atmosphere, is the island  possible.    Just so there can be no consciousness except as that which is already in  the mind--the vast subconscious material of all experience--rises into  view and relates itself through the senses to an outside world. We speak  very glibly of motion, of force, of power. We say \"The car is moving  now.\" But how do we know? Away back there in our babyhood there were  some things that always remained in the same place, while others changed  position. The _changing_ gave our baby minds a queer sensation; it made  a definite impression; and sometimes we heard people say \"move,\" when  that impression came. Finally, we call the feeling of that change  \"move,\" or \"movement,\" or \"motion.\" The word thereafter always brings to  our minds a picture of a change from one place to another. The  process--the slow comprehending of the baby mind--was buried in  forgetfulness even at the time. But had not the subconscious been  imprinted with the incident and all its succeeding associations, that  particular phenomenon we could not name today. It would be an entirely  unique experience. So our recognition of the impression is merely the  rising into consciousness of the subconscious material in response to a  stimulus from the outside world which appeals through the sense of  sight. We can get no response whatever except as the stimulus asking our  attention is related by \"like\" or \"not like\" something already  experienced; that is, it must bear some relation to the known--and  perhaps forgotten--just as the island cannot"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18845"],[0,"Seeing Europe with Famous Authors, Volume 7 (#3)"],[1," and a whole which a  man may long think of, and dream of, but which with all his power of  imagination he can never reach.    Yesterday I was at the Pyramid of Cestius, and in the evening on the  Palatine, on the top of which are the ruins of the palace of the Caesars,  which stand there like walls of rock. Of all this, however, no idea can  be conveyed! In truth, there is nothing little here; altho, indeed,  occasionally something to find fault with--something more or less absurd  in taste, and yet even this partakes of the universal grandeur of all  around....    Yesterday I visited the nymph Egeria, and then the Hippodrome of  Caracalla, the ruined tombs along the Via Appia, and the tomb of  Metella, which is the first to give one a true idea of what solid  masonry really is. These men worked for eternity--all causes of decay  were calculated, except the rage of the spoiler, which nothing can  resist. The remains of the principal aqueduct are highly venerable. How  beautiful and grand a design, to supply a whole people with water by so  vast a structure! In the evening we came upon the Coliseum, when it was  already twilight. When one looks at it, all else seems little; the  edifice is so vast, that one can not hold the image of it in one's  soul--in memory we think it smaller, and then return to it again to find  it every time greater than before.    We entered the Sistine Chapel, which we found bright and cheerful, and  with a good light for the pictures. \"The Last Judgment\" divided our  admiration with the paintings on the roof by Michael Angelo. I could  only see and wonder. The mental confidence and boldness of the master,  and his grandeur of conception, are beyond all expression. After we had  looked at all of them over and over again, we left this sacred building,  and went to St. Peter's, which received from the bright heavens the  loveliest light possible, and every part of it was clearly lit up. As  men willing to be pleased, we were delighted with its vastness and  splendor, and did not allow an over-nice or hypercritical taste to mar  our pleasure. We supprest every harsher judgment; we enjoyed the  enjoyable.    Lastly we ascended the roof of the church, where one finds in little the  plan, of a well-built city. Houses and magazines, springs (in appearance  at least), churches, and a great temple all in the air, and beautiful  walks between. We mounted the dome, and saw glistening before us the  regions of the Apennines, Soracte, and toward Tivoli the volcanic hills.  Frascati, Castelgandolfo, and the plains, and beyond all the sea. Close  at our feet lay the whole city of Rome in its length and breadth, with  its mountain palaces, domes, etc. Not a breath of air was moving, and in  the upper dome it was (as they say) like being in a hot-house. When we  had looked enough at these things, we went down, and they opened for us  the doors in the cornices of the dome, the tympanum, and the nave. There  is a passage all round, and from above you can take a view of the whole  church, and of its several parts. As we stood on the cornices of the  tympanum, we saw beneath us the pope passing to his mid-day devotions.  Nothing, therefore, was wanting to make our view of St. Peter's perfect.  We at last descended to the piazza, and took in a neighboring hotel a  cheerful but frugal meal, and then set off for St. Cecilia's.    It would take many words to describe the decorations of this church,  which was crammed full of people; not a stone of the edifice was to be  seen. The pillars were covered with red velvet wound round with gold  lace; the capitals were overlaid with embroidered velvet, so as to  retain somewhat of the appearance of capitals, and all the cornices and  pillars were in like manner covered with hangings. All the entablatures  of the walls were also covered with life-like paintings, so that the  whole church seemed to be laid out in mosaic. Around the church, and on  the high altar more than two hundred wax tapers were burning. It looked  like a wall of lights, and the whole nave was perfectly lit up. The  aisles and side altars were equally adorned and illuminated. Right  opposite the high altar, and under the organ, two scaffolds were  erected, which also were covered with velvet, on one of which were  placed the singers, and on the other the instruments, which kept up one  unbroken strain of music....    And yet these glorious objects are even still like new acquaintances to  me. One has not yet lived with them, nor got familiar with their  peculiarities. Some of them attract us with irresistible power, so that  for a time one feels indifferent, if not unjust, toward all others.  Thus, for instance, the Pantheon, the Apollo Belvedere, some colossal  heads, and very recently the Sistine Chapel, have by turns so won my  whole heart, that I scarcely saw any thing besides them. But, in truth,  can man, little as man always is, and accustomed to littleness, ever  make himself equal to all that here surrounds him of the noble, the  vast, and the refined? Even tho he should in any degree adapt himself to  it, then how vast is the multitude of objects that immediately press  upon him from all sides, and meet him at every turn, of which each  demands for itself the tribute of his whole attention. How is one to get  out of the difficulty? No other way assuredly than by patiently allowing  it to work, becoming industrious, and attending the while to all that  others have accomplished for our benefit.    Of the beauty of a walk through Rome by moonlight it is impossible to  form a conception, without having witnessed it. All single objects are  swallowed up by the great masses of light and shade, and nothing but  grand and general outlines present themselves to the eye. For three  several days we have enjoyed to the full the brightest and most glorious  of nights. Peculiarly beautiful at such a time is the Coliseum. At night  it is always closed; a hermit dwells in a little shrine within its  range, and beggars of all kinds nestle beneath its crumbling arches; the  latter had lit a fire on the arena, and a gentle wind bore down the  smoke to the ground, so that the lower portion of the ruins was quite  hid by it, while above the vast walls stood out in deeper darkness  before the eye. As we stopt at the gate to contemplate the scene through  the iron gratings, the moon shone brightly in the heavens above.  Presently the smoke found its way up the sides, and through every chink  and opening, while the moon lit it up like a cloud. The sight was  exceedingly glorious. In such a light one ought also to see the  Pantheon, the Capitol, the Portico of St. Peter's, and the other grand  streets and squares--and thus sun and moon, like the human mind, have  quite a different work to do here from elsewhere, where the vastest and  yet the most elegant of masses present themselves to their rays.          THE ANTIQUITIES OF THE CITY[4]    BY JOSEPH ADDISON      There are in Rome two sets of antiquities, the Christian, and the  heathen. The former, tho of a fresher date, are so embroiled with fable  and legend, that one receives but little satisfaction from searching  into them. The other give a great deal of pleasure to such as have met  with them before in ancient authors; for a man who is in Rome can scarce  see an object that does not call to mind a piece of a Latin poet or  historian. Among the remains of old Rome, the grandeur of the  commonwealth shows itself chiefly in works that were either necessary or  convenient, such as temples, highways, aqueducts, walls, and bridges of  the city. On the contrary, the magnificence of Rome under the emperors  is seen principally in such works as were rather for ostentation or  luxury, than any real usefulness or necessity, as in baths,  amphitheaters, circuses, obelisks, triumphal pillars, arches, and  mausoleums; for what they added to the aqueducts was rather to supply  their baths and naumachias, and to embellish the city with fountains,  than out of any real necessity there was for them....    No part of the antiquities of Rome pleased me so much as the ancient  statues, of which there is still an incredible variety. The workmanship  is often the most exquisite of anything in its kind. A man would wonder  how it were possible for so much life to enter into marble, as may be  discovered in some of the best of them; and even in the meanest, one has  the satisfaction of seeing the faces, postures, airs, and dress of those  that have lived so many ages before us. There is a strange resemblance  between the figures of the several heathen deities, and the descriptions  that the Latin poets have given us of them; but as the first may be  looked upon as the ancienter of the two, I question not but the Roman  poets were the copiers of the Greek statuaries. Tho on other occasions  we often find the statuaries took their subjects from the poets. The  Laocoeon is too known an instance among many others that are to be met  with at Rome.    I could not forbear taking particular notice of the several musical  instruments that are to be seen in the hands of the Apollos, muses,  fauns, satyrs, bacchanals, and shepherds, which might certainly give a  great light to the dispute for preference between the ancient and modern  music. It would, perhaps, be no impertinent design to take off all their  models in wood, which might not only give us some notion of the ancient  music, but help us to pleasanter instruments than are now in use. By the  appearance they make in marble, there is not one string-instrument that  seems comparable to our violins, for they are all played on either by  the bare fingers, or the plectrum, so that they were incapable of adding  any length to their notes, or of varying them by those insensible  swellings, and wearings away of sound upon the same string, which give  so wonderful a sweetness to our modern music. Besides that, the  string-instruments must "]]]
