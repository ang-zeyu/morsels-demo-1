The deer is run down and secured by  ropes or otherwise. Corn pollen is then put into the mouth of the deer and  the hands are held over the mouth and nostrils until life is extinct. The  animal now being placed upon his back, a line is drawn with corn pollen,  over the mouth, down the breast and belly to the tail. The line is then  drawn from the right hoof to the right foreleg to the breast line. The  same is done on the left fore leg and the two hind legs. The knife is then  passed over this line and the deer is flayed. Skins procured in this way  are worth, among the Navajo, $50 each. Masks are made of skins prepared in  the same manner. If made of skins of deer that have been shot the wearer  would die of fever.    Buckskin over the entrance to an eastern sweat house denotes dawn; over a  southern, denotes red of morning; over a western, sunset; over a northern,  night.          PREPARATION OF THE SACRED REEDS (CIGARETTE) AND PRAYER STICKS.      Before noon two sheepskins were spread one upon the other before the  song-priest. Upon these was laid a blanket, and on the blanket pieces of  cotton. These rugs extended north and south. The theurgist then produced a  large medicine bag, from which a reed was selected. The reed was rubbed  with a polishing stone, or, more accurately speaking, the polishing stone  was rubbed with the reed, as the reed was held in the right hand and  rubbed against the stone, which was held in the left. It was then rubbed  with finely broken native tobacco, and afterwards was divided into four  pieces, the length of each piece being equal to the width of the first  three fingers. The reeds were cut with a stone knife some 3-1/2 inches  long. An attendant then colored the tubes. The first reed was painted  blue, the second black, the third blue, and the fourth black. Through all  these, slender sticks of yucca had been run to serve as handles while  painting the tubes and also to support the tubes while the paint was  drying. The attendant who cut the reeds sat left of the song-priest,  facing east; a stone containing the paints was placed to the north of the  rug; and upon the end of the stone next to himself the reed-cutter  deposited a bit of finely broken tobacco. In cutting the reeds  occasionally a bit splintered off; these scraps were placed by the side of  the tobacco on the northeast end of the rug.                                  [Illustration]      The attendant who colored the reeds sat facing west; and as each reed was  colored it was placed on the rug, the yucca end being laid on a slender  stick which ran horizontally. The first reed painted was laid to the  north. Three dots were put upon each blue reed to represent eyes and  mouth; two lines encircled the black reeds. Four bits of soiled cotton  cloth were deposited in line on the east of the rug. The three attendants  under the direction of the song-priest took from the medicine bag, first  two feathers from the Arctic blue bird (_Sialia arctica_), which he placed  west of the bit of cloth that lay at the north end of the rug; he placed  two more of the same feathers below the second piece of cloth; two under  the third, and two below the fourth, their tips pointing east. Then upon  each of these feathers he placed an under tail-feather of the eagle. The  first one was laid on the two feathers at the north end of the rug; again  an under tail-feather of the turkey was placed on each pile, beginning  with that of the north. Then upon each of these was placed a hair from the  beard of the turkey, and to each was added a thread of cotton yarn. During  the arrangement of the feathers the tube decorator first selected four  bits of black archaic beads, placing a piece on each bit of cloth; then  four tiny pieces of white shell beads were laid on the cloths; next four  pieces of abalone shell and four pieces of turquois.    In placing the beads he also began at the north end of the rug. An aged  attendant, under the direction of the song-priest, plucked downy feathers  from several humming-birds and mixed them together into four little balls  one-fourth of an inch in diameter and placed them in line running north  and south, and south of the line of plume piles. He sprinkled a bit of  corn pollen upon each ball; he then placed what the Navajo term a  night-owl feather under the balls with its tip pointing to the northeast.  (See Pl. CXIII). The young man facing west then filled the colored reeds,  beginning with the one on the north end. He put into the hollow reed,  first, one of the feather balls, forcing it into the reed with the quill  end of the night-owl feather. (A night-owl feather is always used for  filling the reeds after the corn is ripe to insure a warm winter; in the  spring a plume from the chaparral cock, _Geococcyx californianus_, is used  instead to bring rain). Then a bit of native tobacco was put in. When the  reed was thus far completed it was passed to the decorator, who had before  him a tiny earthen bowl of water, a crystal, and a small pouch of corn  pollen. Holding the crystal in the sunbeam which penetrated through the  fire opening in the roof, he thus lighted the cigarettes which were to be  offered to the gods. The forefinger was dipped into the bowl of water and  then into the corn pollen, and the pollen that adhered to the finger was  placed to the top of the tube. After the four tubes were finished they  were placed on the pieces of cloth, not, however, until a bit of pollen  had been sprinkled on the beads which lay on the cloth. The pollen end of  the tube pointed to the east. The four bunches of feathers were then laid  on the tubes. The song-priest rolled up each cloth and holding the four  parcels with both hands he placed them horizontally across the soles of  the feet, knees, palms, breast, back, shoulders, head, and across the  mouth of the invalid, and the invalid drew a breath as the parcel touched  his lips. He sat to the north of the rug facing east. The sick man then  received the parcels from the song-priest and held them so that the ends  projected from between the thumbs and forefingers, and repeated a prayer  after the theurgist, who sat facing the invalid. The prayer ran thus:          People of the mountains and rocks, I hear you wish to be paid. I      give to you food of corn pollen and humming-bird feathers, and I      send to you precious stones and tobacco which you must smoke; it      has been lighted by the sun's rays and for this I beg you to give      me a good dance; be with me. Earth, I beg you to give me a good      dance, and I offer to you food of humming-birds' plumes and      precious stones, and tobacco to smoke lighted by the sun's rays,      to pay for using you for the dance; make a good solid ground for      me, that the gods who come to see the dance may be pleased at the      ground their people dance upon; make my people healthy and strong      of mind and body.      The prayer being offered, the parcels were given by the theurgist to an  attendant, who deposited them in line three feet apart along the side of  the dancing ground in front of the lodge. Their proper place is  immediately on the ground that is to be danced upon, but to prevent them  from being trampled on they are laid to one side. The black tubes are  offerings to the gods and the blue to the goddesses of the mountains and  to the earth.            THIRD DAY.          FIRST CEREMONY.      The construction of the second sweat house began at sunrise and was  completed at nine o'clock. Several large rocks were heated and placed in  the sweat house and as before white sage and _Bigelovia Douglasii_ were  thrown in, the fumes of which were designed as medicine for the sick man.  After the invalid entered the sweat house, buckskin blankets, etc., were  drawn over the entrance. The song-priest, accompanied by two attendants,  sat a little to the south. He sprinkled meal around the west base of the  house and over the top from north to south and placed the wands around its  base in the manner heretofore described (the twelve wands and medicine  used were the special property of the theurgist). The song-priest holding  the rattle joined the choir in a chant. To his right were two Navajo jugs  filled with water and an Apache basket partly filled with corn meal. A  bunch of buckskin bags, one of the small blue medicine tubes, a mountain  sheep's horn, and a piece of undressed hide lay on the meal. Near by was a  gourd half filled with water in which meal was sprinkled; near this was a  small earthenware vase containing water and finely chopped herbs. At the  conclusion of the chant the song-priest passed his rattle to one of the  choir and stirred the mixture in the bowl with his forefinger, and after a  few remarks to the invalid, who was still in the sweat house, he threw  some of the mixture in upon the hot rocks. This was repeated four times,  when the song-priest returned to his former position. The sweat-house  priest took from his shoulders a Navajo blanket and spread it near the  door a little to the right. A call from one of the attendants was a signal  for Hasjelti and Hostjoghon to appear. The two men personating these gods  were behind a tree south of the sweat house, their bodies, arms, and legs  painted white. Foxskins were attached pendent to the backs of their  girdles. As the gods approached the sweat house, the patient came out and  sat upon the blanket, and Hasjelti took a mountain sheep's horn, in the  right hand and the piece of hide in the other and rubbed the sick man,  beginning with the limbs; as he rubbed down each limb, he threw his arms  toward the eastern sky and cried \"yo-yo!\" He also rubbed the head and  body, holding the hands on opposite sides of the body. After this rubbing,  the sick man drank from the bowl of medicine-water, then arose and bathed  himself with the same mixture, the filled"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19337"],[0,"A Christmas Carol (#3)"],[1,", in the stronghold of the mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his  fifty cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor's household  should; and even the little tailor, whom he had fined five shillings on  the previous Monday for being drunk and blood-thirsty in the streets,  stirred up to-morrow's pudding in his garret, while his lean wife and  the baby sallied out to buy the beef.    Foggier yet, and colder! Piercing, searching, biting cold. If the good  St. Dunstan had but nipped the Evil Spirit's nose with a touch of such  weather as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then indeed he  would have roared to lusty purpose. The owner of one scant young nose,  gnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs,  stooped down at Scrooge's keyhole to regale him with a Christmas carol;  but, at the first sound of        \"God bless you, merry gentleman,      May nothing you dismay!\"    Scrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action, that the singer  fled in terror, leaving the keyhole to the fog, and even more congenial  frost.    At length the hour of shutting up the counting-house arrived. With an  ill-will Scrooge dismounted from his stool, and tacitly admitted the  fact to the expectant clerk in the tank, who instantly snuffed his  candle out, and put on his hat.    \"You'll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?\" said Scrooge.    \"If quite convenient, sir.\"    \"It's not convenient,\" said Scrooge, \"and it's not fair. If I was to  stop half-a-crown for it, you'd think yourself ill used, I'll be bound?\"    The clerk smiled faintly.    \"And yet,\" said Scrooge, \"you don't think _me_ ill used when I pay a  day's wages for no work.\"    The clerk observed that it was only once a year.    \"A poor excuse for picking a man's pocket every twenty-fifth of  December!\" said Scrooge, buttoning his great-coat to the chin. \"But I  suppose you must have the whole day. Be here all the earlier next  morning.\"    The clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge walked out with a growl.  The office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends  of his white comforter dangling below his waist (for he boasted no  great-coat), went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end of a lane of  boys, twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas-eve, and then ran  home to Camden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play at blindman's  buff.    Scrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual melancholy tavern; and  having read all the newspapers, and beguiled the rest of the evening  with his banker's book, went home to bed. He lived in chambers which had  once belonged to his deceased partner. They were a gloomy suite of  rooms, in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little  business to be, that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run  there when it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other  houses, and have forgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and  dreary enough; for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms being  all let out as offices. The yard was so dark that even Scrooge, who  knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands. The fog and  frost so hung about the black old gateway of the house, that it seemed  as if the Genius of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the  threshold.    Now, it is a fact that there was nothing at all particular about the  knocker on the door, except that it was very large. It is also a fact  that Scrooge had seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence  in that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy  about him as any man in the City of London, even including--which is a  bold word--the corporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be borne  in mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley since his  last mention of his seven-years'-dead partner that afternoon. And then  let any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge,  having his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its  undergoing any intermediate process of change--not a knocker, but  Marley's face.    Marley's face. It was not in impenetrable shadow, as the other objects  in the yard were, but had a dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in  a dark cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge as  Marley used to look: with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly  forehead. The hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath of hot air;  and, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly motionless.  That, and its livid colour, made it horrible; but its horror seemed to  be in spite of the face, and beyond its control, rather than a part of  its own expression.    As Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again.    To say that he was not startled, or that his blood was not conscious of  a terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy, would  be untrue. But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished, turned  it sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.    He _did_ pause, with a moment's irresolution, before he shut the door;  and he _did_ look cautiously behind it first, as if he half expected to  be terrified with the sight of Marley's pigtail sticking out into the  hall. But there was nothing on the back of the door, except the screws  and nuts that held the knocker on, so he said, \"Pooh, pooh!\" and closed  it with a bang.    The sound resounded through the house like thunder. Every room above,  and every cask in the wine merchant's cellars below, appeared to have a  separate peal of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to be  frightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and walked across the hall,  and up the stairs: slowly, too: trimming his candle as he went.    You may talk vaguely about driving a coach and six up a good old flight  of stairs, or through a bad young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say  you might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken it broadwise,  with the splinter-bar towards the wall, and the door towards the  balustrades: and done it easy. There was plenty of width for that, and  room to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought he saw a  locomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen  gas-lamps out of the street wouldn't have lighted the entry too well, so  you may suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge's dip.    Up Scrooge went, not caring a button for that. Darkness is cheap, and  Scrooge liked it. But, before he shut his heavy door, he walked through  his rooms to see that all was right. He had just enough recollection of  the face to desire to do that.    Sitting-room, bedroom, lumber-room. All as they should be. Nobody under  the table, nobody under the sofa; a small fire in the grate; spoon and  basin ready; and the little saucepan of gruel (Scrooge had a cold in his  head) upon the hob. Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody  in his dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude  against the wall. Lumber-room as usual. Old fire-guard, old shoes, two  fish baskets, washing-stand on three legs, and a poker.    Quite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked himself in; double  locked himself in, which was not his custom. Thus secured against  surprise, he took off his cravat; put on his dressing-gown and slippers,  and his nightcap; and sat down before the fire to take his gruel.    It was a very low fire indeed; nothing on such a bitter night. He was  obliged to sit close to it, and brood over it, before he could extract  the least sensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel. The  fire-place was an old one, built by some Dutch merchant long ago, and  paved all round with quaint Dutch tiles, designed to illustrate the  Scriptures. There were Cains and Abels, Pharaoh's daughters, Queens of  Sheba, Angelic messengers descending through the air on clouds like  feather beds, Abrahams, Belshazzars, Apostles putting off to sea in  butter-boats, hundreds of figures to attract his thoughts; and yet that  face of Marley, seven years dead, came like the ancient Prophet's rod,  and swallowed up the whole. If each smooth tile had been a blank at  first, with power to shape some picture on its surface from the  disjointed fragments of his thoughts, there would have been a copy of  old Marley's head on every one.    \"Humbug!\" said Scrooge; and walked across the room.    After several turns he sat down again. As he threw his head back in the  chair, his glance happened to rest upon a bell, a disused bell, that  hung in the room, and communicated, for some purpose now forgotten, with  a chamber in the highest story of the building. It was with great  astonishment, and with a strange, inexplicable dread, that, as he  looked, he saw this bell begin to swing. It swung so softly in the  outset that it scarcely made a sound; but soon it rang out loudly, and  so did every bell in the house.    This might have lasted half a minute, or a minute, but it seemed an  hour. The bells ceased, as they had begun, together. They were succeeded  by a clanking noise, deep down below, as if some person were dragging a  heavy chain over the casks in the wine merchant's cellar. Scrooge then  remembered to have heard that ghosts in haunted houses were described as  dragging chains.    The cellar door flew open with a booming sound, and then he heard the  noise much louder on the floors below; then coming up the stairs; then  coming straight towards his door.    \"It's humbug still!\" said Scrooge. \"I won't believe it.\"    His colour changed, though, when, without a pause, it came on through  the heavy door, and passed into the room before his eyes. Upon its  coming in, the dying flame leaped up, as though it cried, \"I know him!  Marley's Ghost!\" and fell again.    The same face: the very same. Marley in his pigtail, usual waistcoat,  tights, and boots; the tassels on the latter bristling, like his  pigtail, and his coat-sk"]]]
