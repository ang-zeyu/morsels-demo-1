We went, before dark, through all the natural--as opposed to  supernatural--miseries incidental to our state.  Dispiriting  reports ascended (like the smoke) from the basement in volumes, and  descended from the upper rooms.  There was no rolling-pin, there  was no salamander (which failed to surprise me, for I don't know  what it is), there was nothing in the house; what there was, was  broken, the last people must have lived like pigs, what could the  meaning of the landlord be?  Through these distresses, the Odd Girl  was cheerful and exemplary.  But within four hours after dark we  had got into a supernatural groove, and the Odd Girl had seen  \"Eyes,\" and was in hysterics.    My sister and I had agreed to keep the haunting strictly to  ourselves, and my impression was, and still is, that I had not left  Ikey, when he helped to unload the cart, alone with the women, or  any one of them, for one minute.  Nevertheless, as I say, the Odd  Girl had \"seen Eyes\" (no other explanation could ever be drawn from  her), before nine, and by ten o'clock had had as much vinegar  applied to her as would pickle a handsome salmon.    I leave a discerning public to judge of my feelings, when, under  these untoward circumstances, at about half-past ten o'clock Master  B.'s bell began to ring in a most infuriated manner, and Turk  howled until the house resounded with his lamentations!    I hope I may never again be in a state of mind so unchristian as  the mental frame in which I lived for some weeks, respecting the  memory of Master B.  Whether his bell was rung by rats, or mice, or  bats, or wind, or what other accidental vibration, or sometimes by  one cause, sometimes another, and sometimes by collusion, I don't  know; but, certain it is, that it did ring two nights out of three,  until I conceived the happy idea of twisting Master B.'s neck--in  other words, breaking his bell short off--and silencing that young  gentleman, as to my experience and belief, for ever.    But, by that time, the Odd Girl had developed such improving powers  of catalepsy, that she had become a shining example of that very  inconvenient disorder.  She would stiffen, like a Guy Fawkes  endowed with unreason, on the most irrelevant occasions.  I would  address the servants in a lucid manner, pointing out to them that I  had painted Master B.'s room and balked the paper, and taken Master  B.'s bell away and balked the ringing, and if they could suppose  that that confounded boy had lived and died, to clothe himself with  no better behavior than would most unquestionably have brought him  and the sharpest particles of a birch-broom into close acquaintance  in the present imperfect state of existence, could they also  suppose a mere poor human being, such as I was, capable by those  contemptible means of counteracting and limiting the powers of the  disembodied spirits of the dead, or of any spirits?--I say I would  become emphatic and cogent, not to say rather complacent, in such  an address, when it would all go for nothing by reason of the Odd  Girl's suddenly stiffening from the toes upward, and glaring among  us like a parochial petrifaction.    Streaker, the housemaid, too, had an attribute of a most  discomfiting nature.  I am unable to say whether she was of an  usually lymphatic temperament, or what else was the matter with  her, but this young woman became a mere Distillery for the  production of the largest and most transparent tears I ever met  with.  Combined with these characteristics, was a peculiar tenacity  of hold in those specimens, so that they didn't fall, but hung upon  her face and nose.  In this condition, and mildly and deplorably  shaking her head, her silence would throw me more heavily than the  Admirable Crichton could have done in a verbal disputation for a  purse of money.  Cook, likewise, always covered me with confusion  as with a garment, by neatly winding up the session with the  protest that the Ouse was wearing her out, and by meekly repeating  her last wishes regarding her silver watch.    As to our nightly life, the contagion of suspicion and fear was  among us, and there is no such contagion under the sky.  Hooded  woman?  According to the accounts, we were in a perfect Convent of  hooded women.  Noises?  With that contagion downstairs, I myself  have sat in the dismal parlor, listening, until I have heard so  many and such strange noises, that they would have chilled my blood  if I had not warmed it by dashing out to make discoveries.  Try  this in bed, in the dead of the night: try this at your own  comfortable fire-side, in the life of the night.  You can fill any  house with noises, if you will, until you have a noise for every  nerve in your nervous system.    I repeat; the contagion of suspicion and fear was among us, and  there is no such contagion under the sky.  The women (their noses  in a chronic state of excoriation from smelling-salts) were always  primed and loaded for a swoon, and ready to go off with hair-  triggers.  The two elder detached the Odd Girl on all expeditions  that were considered doubly hazardous, and she always established  the reputation of such adventures by coming back cataleptic.  If  Cook or Streaker went overhead after dark, we knew we should  presently hear a bump on the ceiling; and this took place so  constantly, that it was as if a fighting man were engaged to go  about the house, administering a touch of his art which I believe  is called The Auctioneer, to every domestic he met with.    It was in vain to do anything.  It was in vain to be frightened,  for the moment in one's own person, by a real owl, and then to show  the owl.  It was in vain to discover, by striking an accidental  discord on the piano, that Turk always howled at particular notes  and combinations.  It was in vain to be a Rhadamanthus with the  bells, and if an unfortunate bell rang without leave, to have it  down inexorably and silence it.  It was in vain to fire up  chimneys, let torches down the well, charge furiously into  suspected rooms and recesses.  We changed servants, and it was no  better.  The new set ran away, and a third set came, and it was no  better.  At last, our comfortable housekeeping got to be so  disorganised and wretched, that I one night dejectedly said to my  sister: \"Patty, I begin to despair of our getting people to go on  with us here, and I think we must give this up.\"    My sister, who is a woman of immense spirit, replied, \"No, John,  don't give it up.  Don't be beaten, John.  There is another way.\"    \"And what is that?\" said I.    \"John,\" returned my sister, \"if we are not to be driven out of this  house, and that for no reason whatever, that is apparent to you or  me, we must help ourselves and take the house wholly and solely  into our own hands.\"    \"But, the servants,\" said I.    \"Have no servants,\" said my sister, boldly.    Like most people in my grade of life, I had never thought of the  possibility of going on without those faithful obstructions.  The  notion was so new to me when suggested, that I looked very  doubtful.    \"We know they come here to be frightened and infect one another,  and we know they are frightened and do infect one another,\" said my  sister.    \"With the exception of Bottles,\" I observed, in a meditative tone.    (The deaf stable-man.  I kept him in my service, and still keep  him, as a phenomenon of moroseness not to be matched in England.)    \"To be sure, John,\" assented my sister; \"except Bottles.  And what  does that go to prove?  Bottles talks to nobody, and hears nobody  unless he is absolutely roared at, and what alarm has Bottles ever  given, or taken?  None.\"    This was perfectly true; the individual in question having retired,  every night at ten o'clock, to his bed over the coach-house, with  no other company than a pitchfork and a pail of water.  That the  pail of water would have been over me, and the pitchfork through  me, if I had put myself without announcement in Bottles's way after  that minute, I had deposited in my own mind as a fact worth  remembering.  Neither had Bottles ever taken the least notice of  any of our many uproars.  An imperturbable and speechless man, he  had sat at his supper, with Streaker present in a swoon, and the  Odd Girl marble, and had only put another potato in his cheek, or  profited by the general misery to help himself to beefsteak pie.    \"And so,\" continued my sister, \"I exempt Bottles.  And considering,  John, that the house is too large, and perhaps too lonely, to be  kept well in hand by Bottles, you, and me, I propose that we cast  about among our friends for a certain selected number of the most  reliable and willing--form a Society here for three months--wait  upon ourselves and one another--live cheerfully and socially--and  see what happens.\"    I was so charmed with my sister, that I embraced her on the spot,  and went into her plan with the greatest ardor.    We were then in the third week of November; but, we took our  measures so vigorously, and were so well seconded by the friends in  whom we confided, that there was still a week of the month  unexpired, when our party all came down together merrily, and  mustered in the haunted house.    I will mention, in this place, two small changes that I made while  my sister and I were yet alone.  It occurring to me as not  improbable that Turk howled in the house at night, partly because  he wanted to get out of it, I stationed him in his kennel outside,  but unchained; and I seriously warned the village that any man who  came in his way must not expect to leave him without a rip in his  own throat.  I then casually asked Ikey if he were a judge of a  gun?  On his saying, \"Yes, sir, I knows a good gun when I sees  her,\" I begged the favor of his stepping up to the house and  looking at mine.    \"SHE'S a true one, sir,\" said Ikey, after inspecting a double-  barrelled rifle that I bought in New York "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18333"],[0,"The Illustrated War News, Number 15, Nov. 18, 1914 (#3)"],[1," Equerry to the  Prince of Wales, was killed while  commanding the 10th Hussars in place of  the Colonel, who  had been wounded. Major Cadogan had  been sharing in the  work  of  the  infantry  in  the trenches.  He  served  in  South  Africa,  and  last year  accompanied  the Prince  of Wales,  who  travelled as  the  \"Earl  of Chester,\"  on  a  visit to  Germany,  where  our photograph  was  taken.--[Photograph by Illus. Bureau.]    Besides, they  have sources of inspiration--have  our \"Tommies\"--denied to  their  Teutonic antagonists.  General von  Kluck, Commander  of the  First  German Army, has  described a visit of  the dread War Lord to  the line of  the Aisne  \"behind the line  of fire\"; and the  \"Hochs\" with which  he was  greeted  by a  Prussian Grenadier  regiment. But  what are  those guttural  \"Hochs\"  compared  with  the  ringing  cheers which  were  evoked  by  the  presence of  Lord Roberts  on the occasion  of his last  visit to  his old  comrades-in-arms  of  the  Indian  Army, now  confronting  those  Prussian  Grenadiers on  the line of  the Yser? When Lord  Roberts was made  a Peer,  after  his  march  from  Cabul  to Candahar,  he  chose  as  his  heraldic  supporters a Gurkha and a Gordon Highlander,  who had done so much to help  him on to victory; and it is  pretty certain that he would have desired no  more congenial and  appropriate manner of death than he  has found, at the  age of  eighty-two, as an  inspiring visitor to  the lines of  the gallant  troops of all  kinds whom he himself  had so often led to  victory. It has  been said that no  man can be called happy until  his death, and certainly  no one was ever more felicitous in  the manner of his end than the veteran  hero, the blameless \"Bayard\" of the British Army, who has well been called  one of Ireland's greatest Englishmen.    Yet his name  will continue to serve  as an inspiration to  the Army which  adored him;  and doubtless his  last moments  were soothed by  the thought  that  the soldiers  whom he  so fervently  loved had  just added  to their  laurels by the brave  repulse on the Yser of two  Brigades, or a Division,  of the boasted Prussian Guards, forming  the very flower and kernel of the  Kaiser's army. And news also must have reached the conqueror of Paardeburg  and Pretoria  that the  German-prompted and German-paid  rebellion against  the Union of  which he had laid the foundation-stone--not  with the trowel  of an architect, but with the sword of a soldier--was collapsing under the  well-directed blows of  such an Imperial patriot and  statesman as General  Botha, proud to wear the uniform of the hero of Candahar.    Thus the last  hours of our veteran Field-Marshal must  have been consoled  with the reflection that, in spite of the fact of all his warnings and his  exhortations having fallen on deaf ears,  victory was gilding our arms, as  well as those  of our Allies, all round;  and that the loss of  two of our  cruisers  off the  coast of  Chile  had been  more than  offsetted by  the  destruction  of the  notorious  commerce-destroyer Emden  in  the seas  of  Sumatra  and the  cornering of  the equally  elusive Koenigsberg  among the  palm-trees  of an  East  African  lagoon--fit incident  for  the pages  of  Captain  Marryat or  Mr. George  Henty,  beloved of  the boy-devourers  of  stirring adventure books.    During  the last  week two  rivers have  again formed  the main  scenes of  action in the far-extended theatre of war--one the Yser, in Belgium, where  the  advance of  the Germans  on  Calais  has been  \"stone-walled\" by  the  Allies; and  the other on the  Vistula, in Poland, where  the Russians, by  sheer  force  of numbers  and  superior  strategy, made  very  considerate  progress in  their march on Berlin;  so that, on the  whole, the horoscope  remained  most favourable  to the  Allies and  the ultimate  attainment of  their Common object.          __________________________________________________________________________                                  THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, NOV. 18, 1914--9      [Illustration: THE VICTORIOUS RUSSIAN CAVALRY IN ACTION: A CHARGE BY THE  GALLANT FORCE WHICH CROSSED THE CARPATHIANS INTO HUNGARY.]    In the recent  victorious operations of the Russian Army  the cavalry have  taken a conspicuous part. The  Headquarters announcement from Petrograd of  November 10 said: \"To the east of Neidenburg near the station of Muschaken  (in  East Prussia,  about two  miles from  the frontier),  Russian cavalry  defeated  a German  detachment which  was guarding  the railway,  captured  transport, and blew up two bridges over  the railway. On the 8th inst. our  cavalry forced one  of the enemy's cavalry divisions,  which was supported  by a  battalion of rifles, to  retreat towards Kalisz (near  the border of  German Poland).\" The above drawing  shows an engagement in Hungary between  an Austro-Hungarian  force and a body  of Russian cavalry who  had crossed  the Carpathians from Galicia.          __________________________________________________________________________  10--THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, NOV. 18, 1914.

JEAN,  DIXMUDE.]    Dixmude, after  a comparative  lull since  it was  first bombarded  by the  Germans, recently  became once more the  objective of a fierce  attack and  fell into the  enemy's hands. The afternoon communique issued  in Paris on  November 11 said: \"At the end of  the day (i.e., the 10th) the Germans had  succeeded in taking possession of Dixmude.  We are still holding on to the  outskirts of this village, on the  canal from Nieuport to Ypres, which has  been  strongly  occupied. The  struggle  has  been  very fierce  at  these  points.\" The late French communique issued the same night said: \"The enemy  throughout the day continued his effort of yesterday without achieving any  fresh results....  He made vain  attempts to  debouch from Dixmude  on the  left bank of the Yser.\"--[Photo. by Newspaper Illustrations.]          __________________________________________________________________________                                 THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, NOV. 18, 1914--11      [Illustration: THE LITTLE BELGIAN TOWN TAKEN BY THE GERMANS AFTER THREE  WEEKS: DIXMUDE--THE HOTEL DE VILLE AND CHURCH TOWER.]    Although  the  Germans  undoubtedly  scored  a  slight  success  by  their  occupation of Dixmude, they did so  at enormous cost. It was reported from  Amsterdam on the  11th that 4000 Germans severely wounded  in the fighting  round Dixmude  had reached  Liege. Dixmude was  for three  weeks gallantly  defended by  French Marines. The  town is now little  more than a  heap of  ruins. As our photographs  show, the fine old church of  St. Jean has been  almost  completely wrecked,  and the  Hotel  de Ville  has suffered  great  damage. It has been pointed out that  the military value of Dixmude to the  Germans  is not  very great,  as  it does  not  form part  of the  Allies'  defensive line,  but was  held as a  bridge-head on the  east bank  of the  Yser.--[Photo. by Newspaper Illustrations.]          __________________________________________________________________________  12--THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, NOV. 18, 1914.      [Illustration: AFTER BOMBARDMENT BY \"AN INFURIATED GERMAN ARMY CORPS\":  THE RUINS OF THE MAIN STREET OF DIXMUDE.]    Dixmude, on the  Yser, suffered terribly during the earlier  stages of the  great battle  in West Flanders.  It was stated  on October 27  that French  Marines holding the  town had withstood a continuous  attack lasting forty  hours,  at the  end  of which  the  place  was in  ruins.  Mr. E.  Ashmead  Bartlett, who visited  Dixmude on October 21, wrote  (in the \"Telegraph\"):  \"The town is not very big, and  what it looked like before the bombardment  I cannot  say.... An infuriated  German army corps were  concentrating the  fire of  all the field guns  and heavy howitzers  on it at the  same time.  There was not an inch that was not  being swept by shells. There was not a  house, as far as I could  see, which had escaped destruction.\"--[Photo. by  Newspaper Illustrations.]          __________________________________________________________________________                                 THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, NOV. 18, 1914--13      [Illustration: WRECKED IN THE MODERN, AND GREATER, BATTLE OF THE DUNES:  IN THE RUINS OF THE FIFTEENTH-CENTURY CHURCH AT NIEUPORT.]    Some idea of  the destruction wrought by German shells  in Nieuport may be  gathered  from this  photograph of  the  interior of  the church,  another  example of the fact, pointed out under a drawing on another page, that the  German gunners  do not respect the  House of God. The  church at Nieuport,  which dated  from the  fifteenth century,  was restored  in 1903,  and its  massive  baroque tower,  visible from  afar,  could be  easily avoided  by  artillerymen  capable of  accurate aim  and desirous  of sparing  a sacred  building. Nieuport has at least twice  before in history been the scene of  conflict.  In 1489  it made  a  stubborn resistance  to an  attack by  the  French, and  near it,  in July 1660,  was fought the  Battle of  the Dunes  between the Dutch and the Spaniards.--[Photo. by Newspaper Illustrations.]          __________________________________________________________________________  14--THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, NOV. 18, 1914.
