Charlie was himself again before we had  well got clear of London, and his reviving spirits gradually recalled to  his memory his father's parting gift, which had for a while been half  forgotten amid other cares.    Now again I was produced, I was turned over and over, was listened to,  was peeped into, was flourished about, was taken off my chain, and put  on again with the supremest satisfaction.  At every station we came to,  out I came from his pocket, to be compared with the railway time.  By  the clock at Batfield I was a minute slow--a discrepancy which was no  sooner discovered than I felt my glass face opened, and a fat finger and  thumb putting forward my hand to the required time.  At Norbely I was  two minutes fast by the clock, and then (oh, horrors!)  I found myself  put back in the same rough-and-ready way.  At Maltby I was full half a  minute behind the great clock, and on I went again.  At the next station  the clock and I both gave the same time to a second, and then what must  he do but begin to regulate me!  After a minute calculation he made the  astounding discovery that I had lost a minute and a quarter in four  hours, and that in order to compensate for this shortcoming it would be  necessary for him to move my regulator forward the two hundred and  fortieth part of an inch.  This feat he set himself to accomplish with  the point of his scarf-pin while the train was jolting forward at the  rate of thirty miles an hour!    I began to grow nervous.  If this was a sample of what I was to expect,  I had indeed need be the healthy, hardy watch I was represented to be by  my maker.    And yet I could not be angry with my brave, honest little tormentor.    It was a sight to see him during that long journey, in all the glory of  a new suit, with a high hat on his head for the first time, and a watch  in his pocket.  _In_ his pocket, did I say?  I was hardly ever so lucky.  Every five minutes he whipped me out to see how the time was going.  If  he polished me up once with his handkerchief, he did it twenty times,  and each time with such vigour that I was nearly red-hot under the  operation.  And no sooner was he tired of polishing me, than he took to  paying his hat the same attention, till that wretched article of  decoration must have trembled for its nap.  Then he would take to  whistling and singing (what boy can help doing one or the other in a  train?) and as I heard all his little artless songs and gay chirping, I  thought it the pleasantest music one could possibly listen to.  And, not  to let his hands be less busy than his throat, he would bring out the  wonderful six-bladed knife his uncle had given him, and exploring all  its wonders, and opening all its blades at the same time, together with  the corkscrew, the gimlet, the pincers, and the button-hook, at  different angles, would terrify the lives out of his fellow-passengers  by twirling the awful bristling weapon in his fingers within a foot or  so of their faces.    \"Mind, dear,\" said an old lady on the seat opposite, \"you'll cut your  fingers off, I'm certain.\"    \"Oh, no, I won't,\" exclaimed he, taking out his handkerchief, and  beginning to polish the blades one after another.    The old lady trembled as she watched him, and sighed with relief when  the operation was over.    Presently, having nothing particular to do, he stared at her.  \"Would  you like to know the time, ma'am?\" he inquired.    \"If you please,\" replied the good old soul.    \"Well, it's just seventeen minutes and nineteen seconds past three by my  watch.  Would you like to see for yourself, ma'am?\"    And, pleased to have a confidant of his possessions, he loosed my chain,  and flourished me bodily before the eyes of his new friend.    She took me kindly, and said, \"What a fine watch you've got, dear?\"    \"Yes,\" replied he, with lofty condescension; \"like to see his works?\"    \"You should be careful, you know,\" she said, \"watches so easily get out  of order.\"    \"Oh, I won't hurt it,\" said he, proceeding to take off my coat and  waistcoat.  \"There! there are his works.  Don't breathe hard, or you'll  damp them.\"    So the old lady held her breath and peeped in, much to my young master's  gratification.    \"And so you're going to school, my man?\" said she presently.    \"Yes; who told you!  Did my father tell you?\"    \"No, I guessed.\"    \"Did you though?  Can you guess what the name of the school is?\"    \"No, I can't do that.\"    \"Have a try.\"    \"Well, then, I guess Randlebury, because my boy is there, and it's the  only one I can think of.\"    The boy stared at her.  \"How ever did you know that?\"    \"What!\" she exclaimed, \"you don't mean to tell me you _are_ going to  Randlebury?\"    \"I am, though.\"    \"Well, I never,\" cried the good old soul, \"who would have believed it!  Think of your going to the same school as my Tom.\"    \"Is Tom your boy's name?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Is he a nice boy?\"    Such a question to ask any one's mother!    The old lady burst into tears instead of answering--a proceeding which  greatly alarmed and disconcerted my master.    \"Don't cry,\" he said excitedly.  \"Look here!  I didn't mean--oh, don't!  Look here, shall I tell you the time?  It's--it's sixteen minutes to  four--I didn't mean, you know.  Of course he's a nice boy--oh, don't  cry!\"    And he got into such a state that the old lady dried her eyes at once.    \"Never mind me, dear,\" said she, \"it wasn't you made me cry: it was  thinking of my Tom.  You'll be a good friend to him, won't you, dear?\"    \"Perhaps he won't like me.\"    \"Now I'm sure he will,\" exclaimed the lady warmly; so warmly that I  quite loved her for my little master's sake.  Both were silent for some  time, and then Charlie asked,--    \"I say, has he got a watch?\"    \"No.\"    \"Oh, never mind,\" said he, in a tone of evident relief, \"I can tell him  the time, you know, whenever he wants to know.\"    \"To be sure you can.\"    Then Charlie took to polishing me and the chain up again, an occupation  which lasted until we arrived at Gunborough Junction, where passengers  changed for Randlebury.    \"Good-bye, dear,\" said the old lady, as Charlie proceeded to get  together his things.    \"Good-bye,\" said he.  \"Would you like to know the time before I go?  It's eight past five.  Good-bye.\"    \"May I give you a kiss?\" said she.    Charlie blushed, but offered his cheek hurriedly.    \"And you promise to be a good friend to Tom,\" said she, kissing him,  \"won't you?\"    \"All right,\" said the boy, jumping out on to the platform, and running  to see after his luggage.    In a moment however he returned to the window and put his head in.    \"I say,\" said he, \"what's his name--Tom what?\"    \"Drift,\" said the old lady, \"Tom Drift!\"    \"Oh!\" replied my master, \"all right, good-bye;\" and next minute the  train went on, and he was left standing surrounded by his luggage in the  middle of the platform, like a lighthouse in the middle of an island.        CHAPTER THREE.    HOW MY MASTER AND I REACH RANDLEBURY IN STATE, AND OF A GREAT CALAMITY.    My master and I had nearly an hour to wait on the platform at Gunborough  before the Randlebury train came up.  Part of this interval Charlie, for  fear he might forget to do it at night, devoted to winding me up; an  experiment which nearly closed my career for ever, for he first began to  turn the key the wrong way; then, when he had discovered his mistake, he  started in the other direction with a sudden dash, and finally overwound  me to such an extent that I expected every second to hear my heart break  with the strain.    Then he sat on his boxes, whistling to himself and drumming his heels on  the platform.  The train came up at last, and in he jumped, finding  himself and a grave elderly gentleman in joint possession of the  carriage.    Charlie was too busy staring out of the window, whistling, and brushing  the dust off his new hat, to take much notice of his companion until the  train was fairly started; then, observing the gentleman look at his  watch, the boy at once recognised a bond of sympathy and pulled out me.    \"I wonder if I'm the same as you?\" he said eagerly.    \"I hope you are not,\" said the gentleman, \"for I'm a quarter of an hour  fast.\"    \"Are you though?\" said the boy, in astonishment.    \"Why don't you put it right?  I would.\"    \"It's a bad thing to put a watch back, my boy; besides, I rather like  keeping mine a little fast.\"    \"Do you?  I say, do you think my watch is a good one?\" said Charlie,  thrusting me into the hands of his astonished travelling companion.    \"I can't say, my boy.  I know nothing about watches.  It looks a nice  one.\"    \"Yes, father gave it me.  I say, are you going to Randlebury?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"Do you know the school?  I'm going there.\"    \"Oh, yes; I know the school.  And you are going there, are you?\"  inquired the gentleman, with interest.    \"Yes, I'm a new boy, you know.\"    \"And how do you like going to school?\"    \"Oh, all right; only I don't know what it'll be like.  Eat I say, I  don't suppose there's many of the boys my age have got watches, do you?\"    The gentleman laughed.  \"I dare say not,\" he said.  Charlie was silent  for a time, and then asked,--    \"I say, what sort of fellow's the head master; do you know?\"    \"I've seen him now and then,\" said the gentleman.    \"Is he awfully stuck-up and strict?\" asked the boy anxiously.    \"I really don't know,\" said the gentleman, biting his lips; \"I hope  not.\"    \"So do I.  I wish my father was the head master,\" said Charlie, the  tears for a moment starting to his eyes at the bare thought of such  happiness.    The gentleman looked at him very kindly, and said,--    \"Cheer up, my little man; perhaps it won't be so bad after all.\"    Charlie smiled again as he said,--    \"Oh, yes, I've got to be brave, you know, because I promised father.  But I say, if you ever come to the school, ask for me--my name's Charlie  Newcome--will you? because I don't know any"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21036"],[0,"My Friend Smith: A Story of School and City Life (#3)"],[1," drawers; and my blue necktie, mind, was not to be touched till my black-  and-pink was past work.    From these matters she passed on to my conduct towards my new masters  and companions.    \"Mind and always tell them the truth straight out, Freddy,\" she said,  \"and say `sir' whenever you speak to Mr Ladislaw--and say your prayers  regularly night and day, won't you? and be very careful to use your own  comb and brush, and not lend them about to the other young gentlemen.\"    Mrs Hudson, you see, had an easy way of flying from one topic to  another.  Her exhortations were crowded with pieces of good advice,  which may have sounded funny when all strung together, but were each of  them admirable taken separately.  I of course promised her everything.    The journey was a long one, but the day was bright, and we had a good  basketful of provender, so it was not tedious.  At length the driver  turned round, and said we should come in sight of Stonebridge at the  next turn of the road.    My spirits began to sink for the first time.  Dismal and all as  Brownstroke had been, how did I know I should not be happier there,  after all, than at this strange new place, where I knew no one?  I  wished the driver wouldn't go so fast.  Mrs Hudson saw my emotion, I  think, for she once more opened fire, and, so to speak, gathered up the  last crumbs of her good counsel.    \"Oh, and Freddy dear,\" fumbling nervously in her pocket, and letting  down her veil, \"write and tell me what they give you to eat; remember,  pork's bad for you, and leave your cuffs behind when you go out bird's-  nesting and all that.  Mind, I'll expect to hear about everything,  especially about whether you get warm baths pretty regularly, and if Mr  Ladislaw is a good Christian man--and look here, dear,\" she continued  hurriedly, producing a little parcel from the depths of her pocket,  \"you're not to open this till I'm away, and be sure to take care of it,  and don't--\"    \"That there chimbley,\" interrupted the driver at this stage, \"is the  fust 'ouse in Stonebridge.\"    Five minutes later we were standing in the hall of Stonebridge House.    It didn't look much like a school, I remember thinking.  It was a large  straggling building, rather like a farmhouse, with low ceilings and  rickety stairs.  The outside was neat, but not very picturesque, and the  front garden seemed to have about as much grass in it as the stairs had  carpets.  As we stood waiting for some one to answer our ring, I  listened nervously, I remember, for any sound or trace of my fellow  \"backward and troublesome boys,\" but the school appeared to be confined  to one of the long straggling wings behind, and not to encroach on the  state portion of the house.    After a second vigorous pull at the bell by our coachman, a stern and  scraggy female put in her appearance.    \"Is this Frederick Batchelor?\" she inquired, in tones which put my  juvenile back up instantly.    \"Yes, this is Master Freddy,\" put in the nervous Mrs Hudson, anxious to  conciliate every one on my behalf.  \"Freddy, dear, say--\"    \"Is that his box?\" continued the stern dame.    \"Yes,\" said Mrs Hudson, feeling rather chilled; \"that's his box.\"    \"Nothing else?\"    \"No, except his umbrella, and a few--\"    \"Take the box up to my room,\" said the lady to a boy who appeared at  this moment.  \"Where is the key?\"    \"I've got that, marm,\" replied Mrs Hudson, warming up a little, \"and I  should like to go over his things myself as they are unpacked.\"    \"Wholly unnecessary,\" replied the female, holding out her hand for the  key.  \"I see to everything of that kind here.\"    \"But I _mean_ to open the box!\" cried Mrs Hudson, breaking out into a  passion quite unusual with her.    I, too, had been getting the steam up privately during the last few  minutes, and the sight of Mrs Hudson's agitation was enough to start  the train.    \"Yes,\" said I, swelling out with indignation, \"Mrs Hudson and I are  going to open the box.  You sha'n't touch it!\"    The female appeared to be not in the least put out by this little  display of feeling.  In fact, she seemed used to it, for she stood  quietly with her arms folded, apparently waiting till we both of us  thought fit to subside.    Poor Mrs Hudson was no match for this sort of battle.  She lost her  control, and expressed herself of things in general, and the female in  particular, with a fluency which quite astonished me, and I did my  little best to back her up.  In the midst of our joint address a  gentleman appeared on the scene, whom I correctly divined to be Mr  Ladislaw himself.    Mr Ladislaw was a short, dapper man, in rather seedy clothes, with long  sandy hair brushed right back over the top of his head, and no hair at  all on his face.  He might have been thirty, or he might have been  fifty.  His eyes were very small and close together; his brow was stern,  and his mouth a good deal pulled down at the corners.  Altogether, I  didn't take to him at first glance, still less when he broke into the  conversation and distinctly took the part of Mrs Hudson's adversary.    \"What is all this, Miss Henniker?\" he said in a quick, sharp voice,  which made me very uncomfortable.    \"This is Mr Jakeman's servant,\" answered the female.  \"She was talking  a little rudely about Frederick Batchelor's luggage here.\"    \"And so was I!\"  I shouted valiantly.  \"It's not _your_ luggage, and you  sha'n't have it, you old--beast!\"    The last word came out half-involuntarily, and I was terribly frightened  as soon as it had escaped my lips.    I do not know how Mr Ladislaw or Miss Henniker took it, for I dare not  look up.  I heard Mrs Hudson utter a mild protest, and next moment was  conscious of being taken firmly by the hand by Mr Ladislaw and led to  the door from which he had just emerged.    \"Remain here, Batchelor,\" said he, sternly, \"till I come back.\"    There was something in his voice and manner which took the spirit out of  me, and he might have spared himself the trouble of locking the door  behind him.  I found myself in a small study, with shelves on the walls  and a writing-table in the window, which looked out on to a playground,  where, in the distance, I could catch sight of three boys swinging.    This first prospect of my future companions so interested me that I had  actually nearly forgotten all about poor Mrs Hudson, when Mr Ladislaw  entered the study and said--\"The person is going now, Batchelor.  If you  like you can say good-bye.\"    I flew out into the hall.  Mrs Hudson was there crying, alone.  What we  said, and how we hugged one another, and how desperately we tried to be  cheerful, I need not relate.  I was utterly miserable.  My only friend,  the only friend I had, was going from me, leaving me in this cheerless  place all alone.  I would have given worlds to return with her.  Mr  Ladislaw stood by as we uttered our last farewells.    \"Be a good boy, Freddy, dear; be a good boy,\" was all she could say.    \"So I will, so I will,\" was all I could reply.  Then she turned to where  the coach was waiting.  But once more she paused, and drew from her  pocket another parcel, this time a box, of the nature of whose contents  I could readily guess.    \"It's only a few sweets, dear.  There, be a good boy.  Good-bye,  Freddy!\"    And in another minute the coach was grating away over the gravel drive,  and I stood utterly disconsolate in Stonebridge House, with my box of  sweets in one hand and Mr Ladislaw at the other.    Some of my readers may have stood in a similar situation.  If they have,  I dare say they can remember it as vividly as any incident in their  life.  I know I can.  I remember instinctively ramming the box into one  of my side trousers pockets, and at the same time wondering whether both  the hats hanging on the pegs were Mr Ladislaw's, or whether one of them  belonged to some one else.    Then suddenly it came over me that the former gentleman stood at my  side, and all my misery returned as he said--    \"I will take you to Miss Henniker, Batchelor; follow me.\"    The sound of the wheels of Mrs Hudson's coach were still audible down  the road, and as I turned my back on them and followed Mr Ladislaw up  the carpetless stairs, it seemed as if I was leaving all hope behind me.    I found Miss Henniker in the middle of a large parlour, with my box  lying open on the ground beside her, and some of my vestments already  spread out on the table.  A half inclination to renew the rebellion came  over me, as I thought how poor dear Mrs Hudson had been triumphed over;  and all these tokens of her kindly soul, folded so neatly, inventoried  so precisely, and all so white and well aired, had here fallen into  strange hands, who reverenced them no more than--than the shirts and  collars and cuffs of I do not know how many more \"backward or  troublesome\" boys like myself.  But I restrained my feelings.    \"I will leave Batchelor in your charge for the present,\" said Mr  Ladislaw.  At the same time he added something in an undertone to Miss  Henniker which I did not catch, but which I was positive had reference  to the dear departed Mrs Hudson, whereat I fumed inwardly, and vowed  that somehow or other I would pay Miss Henniker out.    When Mr Ladislaw was gone Miss Henniker continued her work in silence,  leaving me standing before her.  She examined all my clothes, looked at  the mark on every collar, every sock, and scrutinised the condition of  every shirt-front and \"dicky.\"  At last she came to my Sunday suit, at  the sight of which I remembered all of a sudden my nurse's injunction,  and said, as meekly as possible, \"Oh, if you please, Mrs Hudson says  those are to be hung up, and not laid flat!\"    Miss Henniker stared at me as if I had asked her her age!    \"Silence!\" she said, when she could sufficiently recover herself;  \"and--\"    \"And,\" continued I, carried away with my subject, and really not hearing  her remonstrance--\"and, if you please, I'm to"]]]
