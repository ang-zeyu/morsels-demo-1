Dane set his hands on the parapet of the river drop, blinked as a  lightning bolt crackled in a sky-splitting glare of violet fire. This  was about as far from the steaming islands of Xecho as a man could  imagine.    \"The demon graz prepare for battle.\" Asaki nodded toward the distant  crackling.    Captain Jellico laughed. \"Supposed to be whetting their tusks, eh? I  wouldn't care to meet a graz that could produce such a display by mere  tusk whetting.\"    \"No? But think of the reward for the tracker who discovers where such go  to die. To find the graveyard of the graz herds would make any man  wealthy beyond dreams.\"    \"How much truth is there in that legend?\" Tau asked.    The Chief Ranger shrugged. \"Who can say? This much _is_ true: I have  served my life in the forests since I could walk. I have listened to the  talk of Trackers, Hunters, Rangers in my father's courtyards and field  camps since I could understand their words. Yet never has any man  reported the finding of a body of a graz that died a natural death. The  scavengers might well account for the bulk of flesh, but the tusks and  the bones should be visible for years. And this, too, I have seen with  my own eyes: a graz close to death, supported by two of its kind and  being urged along to the big swamps. Perhaps it is only that the  suffering animal longs for water at its end, or perhaps in the heart of  that morass there does lie the graz graveyard. But no man has found a  naturally dead graz, nor has any returned from exploring the big  swamps....\"    Lightning on peaks which were like polished jet--bare rock above, the  lush overgrowth of jungle below. And between, this fortress held by men  who dared both the heights and the depths. The wildly burgeoning life of  Khatka had surrounded the off-worlders since they had come here. There  was something untameable about Khatka; the lush planet lured and yet  repelled at the same time.    \"Zoboru far from here?\"    The Chief Ranger pointed north in answer to the captain's question.    \"About a hundred leagues. It is the first new preserve we have prepared  in ten years. And it is our desire to make it the best for tri-dee  hunters. That is why we are now operating taming teams--\"    \"Taming teams?\" Dane had to ask.    The Chief Ranger was ready enough to discuss his project.    \"Zoboru is a no-kill preserve. The animals, they come to learn that  after a while. But we cannot wait several years until they do. So we  make them gifts.\" He laughed, evidently recalling some incident.  \"Sometimes, perhaps, we are too eager. Most of our visitors who wish to  make tri-dees want to picture big game--graz, amplet, rock apes,  lions--\"    \"Lions?\" echoed Dane.    \"Not Terran lions, no. But my people, when they landed on Khatka, found  a few animals that reminded them of those they had always known. So they  gave those the same names. A Khatkan lion is furred, it is a hunter and  a great fighter, but it is not the cat of Terra. However, it is in great  demand as a tri-dee actor. So we summon it out of lurking by providing  free meals. One shoots a poli, a water rat, or a landeer and drags the  carcass behind a low-flying flitter. The lion springs upon the moving  meat, which it can also scent, and the rope is cut, leaving a free  dinner.    \"The lions are not stupid. In a very short time they connect the sound  of a flitter cutting the air with food. So they come to the banquet and  those on the flitter can take their tri-dee shots at ease. Only there  must also be care taken in such training. One forest guard on the Komog  preserve became too enterprising. He dragged his kill at first. Then, to  see if he could get the lions to forget man's presence entirely, he hung  the training carcasses on the flitter, encouraging them to jump for  their food.    \"For the guard that was safe enough, but it worked too too well. A month  or so later a Hunter was escorting a client through Komog and they swung  low to get a good picture of a water rat emerging from the river.  Suddenly there was a snarl behind them and they found themselves sharing  the flitter with a lioness annoyed at finding no meat waiting on board.    \"Luckily, they both wore stass belts; but they had to land the flitter  and leave until the lioness wandered off, and she seriously damaged the  machine in her irritation. So now our guards play no more fancy tricks  while on taming runs. Tomorrow--no,\" he corrected himself, \"the day  after tomorrow I will be able to show you how the process works.\"    \"And tomorrow?\" inquired the captain.    \"Tomorrow my men make hunting magic.\" Asaki's voice was expressionless.    \"Your chief witch doctor being?\" questioned Tau.    \"Lumbrilo.\" The Chief Ranger did not appear disposed to add to that but  Tau pursued the subject.    \"His office is hereditary?\"    \"Yes. Does that make any difference?\" For the first time there was a  current of repressed eagerness in the other's tone.    \"Perhaps a vast amount of difference,\" Tau replied. \"A hereditary office  may carry with it two forms of conditioning, one to influence its  holder, one to affect the public-at-large. Your Lumbrilo may have come  to believe deeply in his own powers; he would be a very remarkable man  if he did not. It is almost certain that your people unquestionably  accept him as a worker of wonders?\"    \"They do so accept.\" Once more Asaki's voice was drained of life.    \"And Lumbrilo does not accept something you believe necessary?\"    \"Again the truth, Medic. Lumbrilo does not accept his proper place in  the scheme of things!\"    \"He is a member of one of your Five Families?\"    \"No, his clan is small, always set apart. From the beginning here, those  who spoke for gods and demons did not also order men.\"    \"Separation of church and state,\" commented Tau thoughtfully. \"Yet in  our Terran past there have been times when church and state were one.  Does Lumbrilo desire that?\"    Asaki raised his eyes to the mountain peaks, to the northward where lay  his beloved work.    \"I do not know what Lumbrilo wants, save that it makes mischief--or  worse! This I tell you: hunting magic is part of our lives and it has at  its core some of those unexplainable happenings which you have  acknowledged do exist. I have used powers I can neither explain nor  understand as part of my work. In the jungle and on the grasslands an  off-worlder must guard his life with a stass belt if he goes unarmed.  But I--any of my men--can walk unharmed if we obey the rules of our  magic. Only Lumbrilo does other things which his forefathers did not.  And he boasts that he can do more. So he has a growing following of  those who believe--and those who fear.\"    \"You want me to face him?\"    The Chief Ranger's big hands closed upon the rim of the parapet as if  they could exert enough pressure to crumble the hard stone. \"I want you  to see whether there is trickery in this. Trickery I can fight, for  that there are weapons. But if Lumbrilo truly controls forces for which  there is no name, then perhaps we must patch up an uneasy peace--or go  down in defeat. And, off-worlder, I come from a line of warriors--we do  not drink defeat easily!\"    \"That I also believe,\" Tau returned quietly. \"Be sure, sir, if there is  trickery in this man's magic and I can detect it, the secret shall be  yours.\"    \"Let us hope that so it shall be.\"    Subconsciously, Dane had always associated the practice of magic with  darkness and the night. But the next morning the sun was high and hot  when he made one of the party coming down to a second and larger walled  terrace where the Hunters, Trackers, Guards and other followers of the  Chief Ranger were assembled in irregular rows.    There was a low sound which was more a throb in the clear air about  them, getting into a man's blood and pumping in rhythm there. Dane  tracked the sound to its source: four large drums standing waist high  before the men who tapped them delicately with the tips of all ten  fingers.    The necklaces of claws and teeth about those dusky throats, the kilts of  fringed hide, the crossed belts of brilliantly spotted or striped fur  were in contrast to the very efficient and modern side arms each man  wore, to the rest of the equipment sheathed and strapped at their belts.    There was a carved stool for the Chief Ranger, another for Captain  Jellico. Dane and Tau settled themselves on the less comfortable seats  of the terrace steps. Those tapping fingers increased their rate of  beat, and the notes of the drums rose from the low murmur of hived bees  to the mutter of mountain thunder still half a range away. A bird called  from those inner courts of the palace from which the women never  ventured.    Da--da--da--da.... Voices took up the thud-thud of the drums, the heads  of the squatting men moved in a slow swing from side to side. Tau's hand  closed about Dane's wrist and the younger man looked around, startled,  to see that the medic's eyes were alight, that he was watching the  assembly with the alertness of Sindbad approaching prey.    \"Calculate the stowage space in Number One hold!\"    That amazing order, delivered in a whisper, shocked Dane into obeying  it. Number One hold ... there were three divisions now and the stowage  was--He became aware that for a small space of time he had escaped the  net being woven by the beat of the drum, the drone of voices, the  nodding of heads. He moistened his lips. So that was how it worked! He  had heard Tau speak often enough about self-hypnotism under such  conditions, but this was the first time the meaning of it had been  clear.    Two men were shuffling out of nowhere, wearing nothing on their dark  bodies but calf-length kilts of tails, black tails with fluffy white  tips, which swayed uniformly in time to their pacing feet. Their heads  and shoulders were masked by beautifully cured and semi-mounted animal  heads displaying half-open"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18852"],[0,"The Brochure Series of Architectural Illustration, Vol. 01, No. 03, March 1895 (#3)"],[1,"on, vice-president; Herbert B.

Books.      _Church of Sancta Sophia, Constantinople_: A Study of Byzantine  Building. By W. R. Lethaby and Harold Swainson. Macmillan & Co. 1894.  307 pages with illustrations. $6.50.    It seems especially fitting that a notice of Mr. Lethaby's work on the  church of Sta. Sophia, or as he calls it Sancta Sophia, should appear in  the same issue with the beautiful Byzantine capitals from Ravenna, which  we publish this month. In the description of this work from Ravenna, on  another page, the connection is pointed out between Constantinople, the  capital of the Roman Empire in the East, and Ravenna, then the Western  capital.    The work before us is an important and exhaustive study, both  architecturally and historically, of this beautiful building, which Mr.  Van Brunt has called \"the central building of the world.\" Nothing has  ever been done in enriching interiors which approaches in splendor the  best work of the Byzantine builders, and Sta. Sophia, by general  consent, is the most beautiful of the Byzantine churches; but its  exterior is by no means without faults, and its claim for distinction  would fall if supported only by this.    The book takes up in order the history of Sta. Sophia, with citations of  various authorities for statements concerning its early history;  accounts of the various vicissitudes through which it has passed; its  construction, lighting, details, mosaics, etc., all carefully and  conscientiously described, the descriptive portion based on a  painstaking study of the building itself. The illustrations which  accompany the text are numerous and excellent; there is no attempt to  furnish illustrations at large scale, which are already accessible in  Salzenberg.    The monumental work of Salzenberg, which has been the architect's  reference book for Sta. Sophia, is referred to and largely quoted from.    The two articles by Mr. Henry Van Brunt and Prof. A. D. F. Hamlin,  published in _The Architectural Review_, Vol. II., No. 5, and Vol. III.,  No. 2, will be found of considerable interest in connection with Mr.  Lethaby's book.          Club Notes.      When in our January issue it was announced that we should devote a  certain amount of space and attention to the architectural clubs of the  country, we had no idea of the extent to which these organizations had  developed within the last year or two. The work of a few of the older  clubs was familiar to us, but it is a surprise to find that nearly every  city of importance in the United States has an active and flourishing  society of draughtsmen and young architects. It may be well to suggest  right here that any city which has not such an organization should look  to its laurels.    Among the newer accessions to the ranks is the Baltimore Architectural  Club. It is fortunate in being able to start with a strong, if limited  membership. It is holding weekly meetings, and has already instituted a  series of monthly competitions in design, for which a small cash prize  is offered.    The list of officers is the best evidence of its seriousness of purpose  and ability to accomplish an unlimited amount of good work.    The officers are: president, J. E. Sperry; vice-president, J. B. N.  Wyatt; secretary, Louis E. Simon; and E. F. Baldwin, George Worthington,  J. W. Case, and W. G. Keimig, together with the officers, constitute the  Board of Control.           *       *       *       *       *    The Sketch Club of New York is following the lead of the Chicago  Architectural Club in delegating to one or two of its members the office  of Entertainment Committee for one evening, when these members act as  hosts and provide for the entertainment of the club. This plan has  resulted in an increased attendance at the meetings, and is giving  general satisfaction.           *       *       *       *       *    An outgrowth of the Boston Architectural Club which has shown a great  deal of vitality and in many ways justified its claim to a separate  existence is the little club of twelve members known as the \"P. D's.\"  Without organization and with only the mutual desire for a sort of  Bohemian companionship, these congenial spirits have worked together and  amused each other for the last two years.    They are all members of the Architectural Club and among its most  zealous supporters.    The mystic monogram of the club, the initials P and D contained in a  circle, which was placed on their designs submitted in the two  Beaux-Arts competitions, has probably set more than one interested  person guessing its significance. Its primary meaning is said to be  \"Poor Draughtsmen.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Preceding the last regular meeting of the Philadelphia T Square Club an  informal supper was held at \"Bohemia,\" a charming rathsheller recently  designed by Wilson Eyre, Jr., a member of the executive committee of the  club. The president, Walter Cope, presided, while the fifty-four members  present lubricated their supper with 158 steins of old musty ale.    The meeting which followed was of unusual interest, as the double  programme brought forth a great many designs.    In the competition for a chapel located on the terrace of a wealthy  gentleman's country house, Albert Kelsey, who submitted two sets of  drawings, was fortunate enough to win both first and second mentions,  while E. S. Powers was voted third place.    The competition for a pedestal for a monument was well contested, but  the winner of the first place failed to claim his design. Mr. A. C.  Munoz, a former winner of the McKim Travelling Scholarship, won second  place; and Chas. Z. Klauder, third.           *       *       *       *       *    To the list of Architectural Clubs contained in our February issue  should be added the following:--    Baltimore Architectural Club; secretary, Louis E. Simon, Builders'  Exchange Building.    Cincinnati Architectural Club; secretary, John E. Zettel, 227 Main St.          Society of Beaux-Arts Architects.      The Committee on Education proposes as the subject for its third  competition.        A LARGE CITY CHURCH    for an Episcopal parish.    The wealth of the congregation has been lavished upon this building to  give it a special character of devotion and beauty, to which the  richness of material and the sedate spirit of its classic architecture  alike contribute.    In addition to the vast body of the church, which is to be so arranged  as to give an impression of amplitude and splendor, provision should be  made for vestry, sacristy, and choir-room, conveniently situated for the  service of the sanctuary. Two small chapels for the celebration of minor  services will be situated so as to be accessible both from the exterior  and from the interior of the church proper.    The plot of ground secured for the building is rectangular, and measures  two hundred feet by four hundred feet, open to streets on all sides.    Sketches of plan, elevation, and section, at a scale of one  thirty-second inch to the foot, will be required of all students wishing  to compete; these sketches should be made on opaque drawing paper, not  tracing paper, and forwarded not later than 22d April, 1895, to Mr. John  E. Howe, 140 West 34th Street, New York City.    For the finished drawings the plan will be rendered at a scale of one  sixteenth inch to the foot, the elevation and section at twice that  scale, and a detail at a quarter of the size of execution. The finished  drawings should in every case be mounted on stretchers. The address to  which they are to be forwarded will be announced later. All drawings  must be sent on or before 24th June, 1895.    (Signed) ERNEST FLAGG, _Chairman_,           JOHN M. CARRERE,           JOHN G.
