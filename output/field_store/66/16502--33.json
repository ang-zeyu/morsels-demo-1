Here, sit down in this nice, easy chair, while we take turns  telling you just how young you are.\"    \"It is due to my adopted children that I am not a cross, crotchety,  complaining old woman,\" said Mrs. Gray, allowing Grace to seat her in  the big leather-covered arm chair.    \"Now, what does your Majesty crave of her loyal subjects?\" inquired  Grace, bowing low before the little, old lady.    \"Very well, if I am queen, then I must be obeyed. Draw up your chairs  and sit in a circle. I want to tell you a little story. That is partly  my reason for inviting you here this afternoon, although you know you  are welcome whenever you choose to come.\"    \"Is it a fairy story, dear Mrs. Gray, and does it begin with 'Once upon  a time'?\" queried Jessica.    \"It is a story of real life, my child, but I'll begin it like a fairy  tale if you wish it.\"    \"Oh, please begin at once,\" said Grace, who, at eighteen, was as fond of  a story as she had been at six.    \"Well, 'once upon a time,' there were two sisters. They were really only  half sisters, and the one was almost twenty years older than the other.  The mother of the elder sister had died when she was about fifteen years  of age, and two years later the father had married a beautiful young  Irish girl of very good family, who loved him dearly in spite of the  difference in their ages.    \"After they had been married a little over two years, a little girl came  to them, and the older sister loved the tiny baby as dearly as she loved  her beautiful, young step-mother.\"    \"Why, that sounds very much like Grimm's fairy tales!\" exclaimed Nora.  \"Only the book people are all kings and queens, but this is even better  because the heroine is actually Irish.\"    There was a general laugh over Nora's remark in which Mrs. Gray joined.    \"It's a case of Ireland forever, isn't it Nora?\" said Grace teasingly.    \"'Fine and dandy are the Irish,'\" said Nora with a grin, quoting from a  popular song she had heard in a recent musical comedy. \"But stop teasing  me, and let Mrs. Gray go on with her story.\"    \"When the baby sister, whose name was Edith, was about three years old,  the beautiful young mother died and left the husband inconsolable. A  year later he was killed in a railroad accident, and the elder sister,  named Margaret, was left with only little Edith to comfort her. The  father had been a rich man, so they had no anxiety about money, and  lived on year after year in their beautiful old home, with everything  heart could wish.    \"As Edith grew older, she developed a decided talent for music, and  when she was fifteen Margaret decided to take her abroad and allow her  to enter one of the great conservatories of Europe. They went to  Leipsic, and Edith, who had high hopes of one day becoming a concert  pianiste, continued her studies under the best instructors that money  could procure. Things ran along smoothly until Edith met a young Italian  named Guido Savelli, who was studying the violin at the same  conservatory. His brilliant playing had already created a sensation  wherever he appeared, and he gave promise of being a virtuoso.    \"He fell violently in love with Edith, who had her mother's beautiful blue  eyes and the combination of white skin and black hair that go to make an  Irish beauty. She returned his love, and after a brief engagement they  were married, much against the wishes of Margaret, who thought them both  too young and impressionable to know their own minds.\"    \"And did they live happy ever after?\" asked Grace eagerly.    \"That is the sad part of my story,\" said Mrs. Gray, sighing. \"They were  anything but happy. They both had too much of the artistic temperament  to live peaceably. Besides, Guido Savelli was thoroughly selfish at  heart. Next to himself, his music was the only thing in the world that  he really cared for. When they had been married for about a year and a  half he played before the king, and soon became the man of the hour. He  neglected his beautiful young wife, who, in spite of their frequent  quarrels, loved him with a pure and disinterested affection.    \"Finally he went on a concert tour through the principal European  cities, and she never saw him again. She wrote him repeatedly, but he  never answered her letters, and she was too proud to follow him. She had  one child, a baby girl, named Eleanor, who was the sole comfort of the  heartbroken mother.\"    At this juncture Anne and Grace exchanged significant glances.    \"When Eleanor was about a year old, the mother wrote Guido Savelli once  more, begging him to come to her, if only for the sake of his child, but  either he never received the letter or else paid no attention to it, for  she received no reply. She relapsed into a dull, apathetic state, from  which the repeated efforts of her sister failed to arouse her. The  following winter she contracted pneumonia and died, leaving her sister  the sole guardian of Eleanor.\"    \"How long ago did all this happen, dear Mrs. Gray?\" queried Nora  eagerly, \"and is little Eleanor living?\"    \"It was sixteen years ago, my dear,\" replied Mrs. Gray, \"and the reason  that I have told you this long tale is because the baby girl is almost a  woman now, and----\"    \"The girl is Eleanor Savell and we met her the other day,\" broke in  Grace excitedly, forgetting for an instant that she had interrupted Mrs.  Gray. \"She is going to live at 'Heartsease' and---- oh, Mrs. Gray,  please pardon me for interrupting you, I was so excited that I didn't  realize my own rudeness.\"    \"Granted, my dear,\" smiled the old lady. \"But how did you happen to meet  Eleanor? They arrived only a few days ago.\"    Grace rapidly narrated their meeting and conversation with Eleanor,  while Mrs. Gray listened without comment. When Grace repeated Eleanor's  remark about having made up her mind, the old lady looked a little  troubled. Then her face cleared and she said softly:    \"My dear Christmas children, I am very anxious that for her own sake you  should become well acquainted with Eleanor. Her aunt was here yesterday,  and we had a long talk regarding her. Eleanor is an uncommon girl in  many respects. She has remarkable beauty and talent, but she is  frightfully self-willed. Her aunt has spoiled her, and realizes too  late the damage she has done by having allowed her to grow up on the  continent. They have lived in France, Germany, Italy and Spain, with an  occasional visit to America, and Eleanor has always done just as she  pleased. For years her aunt has obeyed her slightest whim, but as she  grows older she grows more like her father, and her aunt wants her to  have some steadying influence that will put a curb on her unconventional  tendencies.    \"When she wrote me of Eleanor, I wrote her about my girls, and offered  her 'Heartsease.' She was delighted with the whole thing and lost no  time in getting here. So now you understand why I have told you all  this. I want you to promise me that you will do what you can for this  motherless girl.\"    \"But we felt sure we should like her when we saw her the other day,\"  said Nora. \"She seemed so sweet and winning.\"    \"So she is. She has her father's winning personality, and a good deal of  his selfishness, too,\" replied Mrs. Gray. \"You won't find her at all  disagreeable. But she is reckless, self-willed, defiant of public  opinion and exceedingly impulsive. I look to you girls to keep her out  of mischief.\"    \"Well, we'll try, but I never did pride myself on being a first-class  reformer,\" said Grace, laughing.    \"Where is her father now?\" asked Anne. \"Is it possible that he is the  great Savelli who toured America two years ago?\"    \"He is the man,\" said Mrs. Gray. \"He is a wonderful musician. I heard  him in New York City. I shall never forget the way he played one of  Liszt's 'Hungarian Rhapsodies.' I must caution you, girls, never to  mention Eleanor's father to her. She has been kept in absolute ignorance  of him. When she is twenty-one her aunt will tell her about him. If she  knew he was the great Savelli, she would rush off and join him  to-morrow, she is so impulsive. She has the music madness of both father  and mother. Her aunt tells me she is a remarkable performer on both  violin and piano.\"    \"But why shouldn't she go to her father if he is a great musician?\" said  Jessica. \"And why is she called Savell, if her name is Savelli?\"    \"Because, my dear, her father has never evinced the slightest desire to  look up his own child. Even if he had, he is too irresponsible and too  temperamental to assume the care of a girl like Eleanor,\" Mrs. Gray  answered. \"No, Eleanor is better off with her aunt. As to her name, her  aunt hates everything Italian, so she dropped the 'I' and made the name  Savell.\"    \"My,\" said Nora with a sigh. \"She is almost as remarkable as a fairy  princess, after all.\"    \"Oh, I don't know,\" replied Grace quickly. \"Her life, of course, has  been eventful, but I believe if we are to do her any good we shall just  have to act as though she were an everyday girl like the rest of us. If  we begin to bow down to her, we shall be obliged to keep it up. Besides,  I have an idea that I am as fond of having my own way as she is.\"    \"Dinner is served,\" announced John, the butler.    The four girls arose and followed Mrs. Gray to the dining room. During  the dinner Eleanor was not again mentioned, although she occupied more  or less of the four girls' thoughts.    Later on, David, Hippy and Reddy appeared and a merry frolic ensued. It  was after ten o'clock before the little party of young folks prepared to  take their departure.    \"Remember, I rely upon you,\" whispered Mrs. Gray to Grace as she kissed  her good night. Grace nodded sympathetically, but went home with an  uneasy feeling that playing the guardian angel to Eleanor would be  anything but a light task.          CHAPTER III    AN AUTUMN"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17829"],[0,"The Trained Memory (#3)"],[1,"has been called as the cause of hay  fever, into a complex, \"an automatically working mechanism.\" And the  validity of this explanation of the regular recurrence of attacks of  this disease is sufficiently demonstrated by the fact that a paper rose  is likely to prove just as effective in producing all the symptoms of  the disease as a rose out of Nature's garden.    Another striking illustration of the working of this principle is  afforded by two gentlemen of my acquaintance, brothers, each of whom  since boyhood has had unfailing attacks of sneezing upon first arising  in the morning. No sooner is one of these men awake and seated upon the  edge of his bed for dressing than he begins to sneeze, and he continues  to sneeze for fifteen or twenty minutes thereafter, although he has no  \"cold\" and never sneezes at any other time.    [Sidenote: _Two Classes of \"Complexes\"_]    Obviously, if absolutely all mental experiences are preserved, they  consist altogether of two broad classes of complexes: first, those that  are momentarily _active in consciousness_, forming part of the present  mental picture, and, second, all the others--that is to say, all past  experiences that are _not at the present moment before the mind's eye_.    There are, then, _conscious_ complexes and _subconscious_ complexes,  complexes of _consciousness_ and complexes of _subconsciousness_.    [Sidenote: _The Subconscious Storehouse_]    And of the complexes of subconsciousness, some are far more readily  recalled than others. Some are forever popping into one's thoughts,  while others can be brought to the light of consciousness only by some  unusual and deep-probing stimulus. And _the human mind is a vast  storehouse of complexes, far the greater part buried in  subconsciousness_, yet somehow, like impressions on the wax cylinder of  a phonograph, preserved with life-like truth and clearness.    Turn back for a moment to our definition of memory. You will observe  that its second essential element is Recall.    Recall is the process by which the experiences of the past are summoned  from the reservoir of the subconscious into the light of present  consciousness. We necessarily touched upon this process in a previous  book, in considering the Laws of Association, but here, in relation to  memory, we shall go into the matter somewhat more analytically.          THE LAWS OF RECALL    [Illustration: Decorative Header]      CHAPTER IV    THE LAWS OF RECALL      [Sidenote: _The Law of Integral Recall_]    Law I. The primary law of recall is this: _The recurrence or  stimulation of one element in a complex tends to recall all the others._    In our explanation of \"complex\" formation we necessarily cited instances  that illustrate this principle as well, since _recall is merely a  reverse operation from that involved in \"complex\" formation_.    [Sidenote: _What Ordinary \"Thinking\" Amounts to_]    For example, in running through a book I come upon a flower pressed  between its pages. At once the memory of the friend who gave it to me  springs into consciousness and becomes the subject of reminiscence. This  recalls the mountain village where we last met. This recalls the fact  that a railroad was at the time under process of construction, which  should transform the village into a popular resort. This in turn  suggests my coming trip to the seashore, and I am reminded of a business  appointment on which my ability to leave town on the appointed day  depends. And so on indefinitely.    Far the greater part of your successive states of consciousness, or even  of your ordinary \"thinking,\" commonly so-called, consists of trains of  mental pictures \"suggested\" one by another. If the associated pictures  are of the everyday type, common to everyone, you have a prosaic mind;  if, on the other hand, the associations are unusual or unique, you are  happily possessed of wit and fancy.    [Sidenote: _The Reverse of Complex Formation_]    These instances of the action of the Law of Recall illustrate but one  phase of its activity. They show simply that groups of ideas are so  strung together on the string of some common element that _the activity  of one \"group\" in consciousness is apt to be automatically followed by  the others. But the law of association goes deeper than this. It enters  into the activity of every individual group, and causes all the elements  of every group, ideas, emotions and impulses to muscular movements, to  be simultaneously manifested._    [Sidenote: _Prolixity and Terseness_]    There is no principle to which we shall more continually refer than this  one. Our explanation of hay fever a moment ago illustrates our meaning.  Get the principle clearly in your mind, and see how many instances of  its operation you can yourself supply from your own daily experience.    So far as the mere linking together of groups of ideas is concerned,  this classifying quality is developed in some persons to a greater  degree than in others. It finds its extreme exemplar in the type of man  who can never relate an incident without reciting all the prolix and  minute details and at the same time wandering far from the original  subject in pursuit of every suggested idea.    [Sidenote: _The Law of Contiguity_]      Law II. _Similarity and nearness in time or space between two  experiential facts causes the thought of one to tend to recall the  thought of the other._    This is the Associative Law of Contiguity considered from the standpoint  of recall. The points of contiguity are different for different  individuals. Similarities and nearnesses will awaken all sorts of  associated groups of ideas in one person that are not at all excitable  in the same way in another whose experiences have been different.      Law III. _The greater the frequency and intensity of any given  experience, the greater the ease and likelihood of its reproduction and  recall._    [Sidenote: _Laws of Habit and Intensity_]    This explains why certain groups in any complex are more readily  recalled than others--why some leap forth unbidden, why some come next  and before others, why some arrive but tardily or not at all.    This is how the associative Laws of Habit and Intensity affect the power  of recall.           *     *     *     *     *    [Sidenote: _Applications to Advertising_]    There is no department of business to which the application of these  Laws of Recall is so apparent as the department of advertising. The most  carefully worded and best-illustrated advertisement may fail to pay its  cost unless the underlying principles of choice of position, selection  of medium and size of space are understood. The advertisers in  metropolitan newspapers and magazines of large circulation are the ones  who have most at stake. But whatever the field to be reached, it is well  to bear in mind certain facts based on the Laws of Recall that have been  established by psychological experiment.    Most advertisers have a general idea that certain relative positions on  the newspaper or magazine page are to be preferred over others, but they  have no conception of the real differences in relative recall value.  When the great cost of space in large publications is considered the  financial value of such knowledge is evident.    By a great number of tests the relative recall value of every part of  the newspaper page has been approximately determined. It has been  found, for example, that a given space at the upper right-hand corner of  the page has more than twice the value of the same amount of space in  the lower left-hand corner.    [Sidenote: _Effect of Repetitions_]    Many advertisers adopt the policy of repeating full-page advertisements  at long intervals instead of advertising in a small way continually.  Laboratory tests have shown, on the contrary, that a quarter-page  advertisement appearing in four successive issues of a newspaper is  fifty per cent more effective than a full-page advertisement appearing  only once. It does not follow, however, that an eighth-page  advertisement repeated eight times is correspondingly more effective;  for below a certain relative size the value of an advertisement  decreases much more rapidly than the cost. There are, of course,  modifying conditions, such as special sales of department stores, where  occasional displays and announcements make it desirable to use either  full pages, or even double pages, but the great bulk of advertising is  not of this character.    [Sidenote: _Ratio of Size to Value_]    Every year in the United States alone six hundred millions of dollars  are expended in advertising the sale of commodities, and for the most  part expended in a haphazard, experimental and unscientific way. The  investment of this vast sum with risk of perhaps total loss, or even  possible injury, through the faulty construction or improper placing of  advertisements should stimulate the interest of every advertiser in the  work that psychologists have done and are doing toward the accumulation  of a body of exact knowledge on this subject.

Wittingly or unwittingly, consciously or unconsciously, every  man's attention swings in automatic obedience to the Laws of Recall.    Attention is the artisan that, bit by bit, and with lightning quickness,  constructs the mosaic of consciousness.    Having the whole vast store of all present and past experiences to draw  upon, he selects only those groups and those isolated instances that  are related to our general interests and aims. He disregards others.    [Sidenote: _How the Attention"]]]
