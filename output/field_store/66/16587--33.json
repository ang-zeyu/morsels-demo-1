Professor Sadler then spoke  in words that will never be forgotten by those who heard them; and in his  address used a quotation from a Universal Prayer, which had been submitted  by an earnest Baha'i to 'Abdu'l-Baha, the year before in Egypt and which  had been completed by him and commended as one that could be used by  peoples of all faiths in the East and West.    The Chairman was followed by Sir Richard Stapley, Mr. Eric Hammond, Mr.  Claude Montefiore, Mrs. Stannard from Egypt, and others. As 'Abdu'l-Baha  left the hall, the poor people of the neighbourhood, crowded on the  pavement to see him and an eager-faced little lame girl on crutches was  specially brought to him.            MEETING OF FAREWELL TO 'ABDU'L-BAHA.                                September 29th, 1911.          Reprinted by kind permission, from the Christian Commonwealth of      Oct. 4th.      At the invitation of Mrs. Thornburgh-Cropper about four hundred and sixty  representative people met in the hall of the Passmore Edwards' Settlement,  Tavistock Place, last Friday evening to bid farewell to 'Abdu'l-Baha Abbas  on the eve of his departure for Paris. Arriving in London on Monday  evening, September the fourth, he has spent a happy and busy four weeks in  our midst. Except for a brief visit to Bristol last week he remained at  97, Cadogan Gardens. His time was mainly occupied in interviews with  people who wish to meet him. These included not a few whose names are  household words in this country, and some travelled long distances to see  him.    A beautiful spirit prevailed on Friday evening. The atmosphere was very  different from that of an ordinary meeting or religious gathering.  Everyone present was enriched by the lofty spiritual tone of the  proceedings; the notes struck were all in the direction of Brotherhood,  Unity, and Peace. While a report of the speeches would give a very  inadequate idea of the effect produced, yet they were so well-conceived,  so sincere, so exquisitely phrased as to be all worthy of reproduction.  Among others Amir Ali Siyyid wrote regretting his inability to be present,  and Archdeacon Wilberforce sent affectionate greetings.    After the Lord's Prayer and prayers for Unity of Baha'u'llah and Gelasius  (fifth Century), Professor Michael Sadler spoke as follows:--          Speech of Professor Michael Sadler      We have met together to bid farewell to 'Abdu'l-Baha, and to thank God for  his example and teaching, and for the power of his prayers to bring Light  into confused thought, Hope into the place of dread, Faith where doubt  was, and into troubled hearts, the Love which overmasters self-seeking and  fear.    Though we all, among ourselves, in our devotional allegiance have our own  individual loyalties, to all of us 'Abdu'l-Baha brings, and has brought, a  message of Unity, of sympathy and of Peace. He bids us all be real and  true in what we profess to believe; and to treasure above everything the  Spirit behind the form. With him we bow before the Hidden Name, before  that which is of every life the Inner Life! He bids us worship in fearless  loyalty to our own faith, but with ever stronger yearning after Union,  Brotherhood, and Love; so turning ourselves in Spirit, and with our whole  heart, that we may enter more into the mind of God, which is above class,  above race, and beyond time.    Professor Sadler concluded with a beautiful prayer of James Martineau.    Mr. Eric Hammond said the Baha'i movement stood for unity; one God, one  people; a myriad souls manifesting the divine unity, a unity so complete  that no difference of colour or creed could possibly differentiate between  one Manifestation of God and another, and a sympathy so all-embracing as  to include the very lowest, meanest, shabbiest of men; unity, sympathy,  brotherhood, leading up to a concord universal. He concluded with a saying  of Baha'u'llah, that the divine cause of universal good could not be  limited to either East or West.    Miss Alice Buckton said we were standing at one of the springtimes of the  world, and from that assembly of representatives of thought and work and  love, would go out all over the world influences making for unity and  brotherhood The complete equality of men and women was one of the chief  notes of Baha'i teaching.    Sir Richard Stapley pointed out that unity must not be sought in the forms  and externals of religion, but in the inner spirit. In Persia there had  been such an impulse towards real unity as was a rebuke to this so-called  Christian country.    Mr. Claude Montefiore, as a Jew, rejoiced in the growth of the spirit of  unity, and regarded that meeting as prophetic of the better time to come,  and in some sense a fulfillment of the idea expressed by one who fell as a  martyr to the Roman Catholic faith, Sir Thomas More, who wrote of the  great Church of the Utopians, in which all varieties of creeds gathered  together, having a service and liturgy that expressed the higher unity,  while admitting special loyalties.    Mrs. Stannard dwelt on what that meeting and the sentiments expressed  meant to the East, especially to the women, whose condition it was  difficult for the West to understand.    Tammaddun'ul-Mulk testified to the unifying effect the Baha'i movement had  had in Persia, and of the wonderful way in which it had spread to America  and other countries.    Then 'Abdu'l-Baha rose to give his farewell address. An impressive figure,  the face rather worn but the eyes full of animation, he stood for about  fifteen minutes, speaking in soft musical Persian. With hands extended,  palms upwards, he closed with a prayer.          Farewell words of 'Abdu'l-Baha      O Noble friends and seekers for the Kingdom of God! About sixty years ago  in the time when the fire of war was blazing among the nations of the  world, and bloodshed was considered an honour to mankind; in a time when  the carnage of thousands stained the earth; when children were rendered  fatherless; when fathers were without sons and mothers were spent with  weeping; when the darkness of inter-racial hatred and animosity seemed to  envelope mankind and blot out the divine light; when the wafting of the  holy breath of God seemed to be cut off--in that time Baha'u'llah rose like  a shining star from the horizon of Persia, inspired with the message of  Peace and of Brotherhood among men.    He brought the light of guidance to the world; He kindled the fire of love  and revealed the great reality of the True Beloved. He sought to destroy  the foundations of religious and racial prejudice and of political  rivalry.    He likened the world of humanity to a tree, and all the nations to its  branches and the people to its leaves, buds and fruits.    His mission was to change ignorant fanaticism into Universal love, to  establish in the minds of His followers the basis of the unity of humanity  and to bring about in practice the equality of mankind. He declared that  all men were equal under the mercy and bounty of God.    Then was the door of the Kingdom set wide and the light of a new heaven on  earth revealed unto seeing eyes.    Yet the whole Baha'u'llah's life was spent in the midst of great trial and  cruel tyranny. In Persia He was thrown into prison, put into chains, and  lived constantly under the menace of the sword. He was scorned and  scourged.    When He was about thirty years old He was exiled to Ba_gh_dad, and from  Ba_gh_dad to Constantinople, and from there to Adrianople and lastly to  the prison of Akka.    Yet under chains and from His cell He succeeded in spreading His cause,  and uplifting the banner of the oneness of humanity.    Now, God be praised, we see the light of Love shining in the East and in  the West; and the tent of fellowship is raised in the midst of all the  peoples for the drawing together of all hearts and souls.    The call of the Kingdom has been sounded, and the annunciation of the  world's need for Universal Peace has enlightened the world's conscience.    My hope is that through the zeal and ardour of the pure of heart, the  darkness of hatred and difference will be entirely abolished, and the  light of love and unity shall shine; this world shall become a new world;  things material shall become the mirror of the divine; human hearts shall  meet and embrace each other; the whole world become as a man's native  country and the different races be counted as one race.    Then disputes and differences will vanish, and the Divine Beloved be  revealed on this earth.    As the East and the West are illumined by one sun, so all races, nations,  and creeds shall be seen as the servants of the One God. The whole earth  is one home, and all peoples, did they but know it, are bathed in the  oneness of God's mercy. God created all. He gives sustenance to all. He  guides and trains all under the shadow of his bounty. We must follow the  example God Himself gives us, and do away with all disputations and  quarrels.    Praise be to God! the signs of friendship are appearing, and as a proof of  this I, today, coming from the East, have met in this London of the West  with extreme kindness, regard and love, and I am deeply thankful and  happy. I shall never forget this time I am spending with you.    Forty years I endured in a Turkish prison. Then in 1908 the Young Turks  \"Committee of Union and Progress\" shook the gates of despotism and set all  prisoners free, myself among them. I pray that blessing may be upon all  who work for Union and Progress.    In the future untrue reports will be spread regarding Baha'u'llah in order  to hinder the spread of Truth. I tell you this, that you may be awake and  prepared.    I leave you with prayer that all the beauty of the Kingdom may be yours.  In deep regret at our separation, I bid you good-bye.                                    * * * * *    The translation of the valedictory having been "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19251"],[0,"Arohanui: Letters from Shoghi Effendi to New Zealand (#3)"],[1,"has lately been troublesome and they think the moist heat during  the summer here would be bad for me. On the same day on which this  decision was arrived at, I received a cordial invitation to go to a place  in the Black Forest for my summer vacation. The Drs considered this place  would be ideal for me and that the sooner I got away the better, so I  leave in 3 days time. My address will be c/o Frau Victoria von Sigsfeld,  Husli, Finsterlingen, bei St Blaisien, Baden, Germany. I hope to return to  Haifa in the latter part of Sept. to resume my work here.    Shoghi Effendi, the members of the Holy Household and the friends here  join in loving greetings and best wishes.    Your brother in the service of the Beloved,  J. E. Esslemont    Mrs Schopflocher arrived here last night after a very successful tour in  Russia, Persia and Iraq.    [From the Guardian:]    _My dear co-worker:_    _I was very glad indeed to learn about your experiences and visit to the  friends and your firm determination to labour unceasingly in the Divine  Vineyard. I will continue to pray for you that all your relatives and  friends may recognise and be illumined with the resplendent Light of this  Divine Revelation. Never feel disheartened and trust me ever your  affectionate, grateful and true brother in the service of the Cause._    _Shoghi_          (6) November 4th, 1925      Dear Baha'i Sister,    Shoghi Effendi received your kind letter and wishes me to acknowledge its  receipt. He hopes that on your return to New Zealand you will obtain  divine assistance in your services to the Cause. That land has been newly  opened to the Baha'i Movement. The work of the friends therefore,  interesting and useful as it may be, is hard and most exacting to one's  patience and energy. It needs great perseverance to obtain a hearing among  the people and draw their attention to this Blessed Cause. But once that  that has been obtained and the way smoothed then progress becomes  increasingly great and the fruits of your labours appreciated.    Shoghi Effendi is very glad that you have enjoyed your trip to England.  The Friends there though they are few in number, are full of love and  affection, one cannot but feel at home among them.    Shoghi Effendi thanks Miss Nora Lee for the kind contribution she has made  to the Cause. It will be spent for the progress of this movement so dear  to the heart of us all. Enclosed there will be a receipt for that amount.    Shoghi Effendi and the other members of the family send you their best  Baha'i love and greeting and wish you success in your services to the  Cause.    Your brother in His Name,  Ruhi Afnan    [From the Guardian:]    _My dearest fellow-worker:_    _My prayers accompany you wherever you go. I wish you to be happy,  confident and active. Rest assured of my great admiration of your zeal and  steadfast labours, of my confidence in the success of your splendid  pioneer services and of my eagerness to hear from you about the progress  of your work._    _Your true brother, _  _ Shoghi_          (7) December 5th, 1925      _To the publisher of the Baha'i Magazine, \"The Herald of the South\"._    _My dear friend and fellow-worker:_    _I have just heard the welcome news of the publication of the first issue  of the Baha'i Journal, recently established by the friends of Australia  and New Zealand. I rejoice in this new and notable Baha'i enterprise,  particularly as it is undertaken by my dearly-beloved and self-sacrificing  brothers and sisters in a land which holds so great a promise for the  future._    _I have followed the progress of the activities of the Baha'is of  Australia and New Zealand with keen interest and ever-increasing  confidence, and with a deep sense of pride and gratitude. I most heartily  welcome this newly-added link in the chain of the many services, so  lovingly and spontaneously rendered by the pioneers of the Cause in these  lands. I assure you of my steadfast prayers for the speedy expansion and  consolidation of this youngest of all Baha'i Magazines, and of my earnest  endeavours to enable it attain a standard worthy of the bearer of such a  noble Message._    _It should be the object and purpose of its author and publisher to open  its pages to the consideration and review of matters that are strictly  Baha'i in character, as well as to the treatment of topics of a  humanitarian, ethical and religious nature; that its readers, while  witnessing to the liberal and broad-minded attitude of the Baha'i Cause,  may receive from it their full share of inspiration which only a clear and  direct statement of the Divine Message can impart._    _Go forth, on thy noble errand, O thou Herald of the South! Join thy  voice, however feeble, to those of thy sister-journals who, in various  parts of the world, are raising with one accord the call of this new Day  of God. Persevere in thy labours, endeavour to reach every circle and  every home, that the light thou bearest may in the fulness of time  illuminate with its healing rays the uttermost corners of that distant and  troubled continent._    _Your well-wisher, _  _ Shoghi_          (8) March 4th, 1926      Dear Baha'i Sister,    Your letter to Shoghi Effendi and the enclosed one to Ruhi with the postal  order for L10 have been received and read with keen interest and pleasure.    We are all very happy to know that you have had such a pleasant journey  back home and that you had the opportunity of delivering the message on so  many occasions. We hope and pray that the seed you have sown has fallen on  fertile soil and that in time it will grow and bear abundant fruit.    We hope that now through your sustained zeal and effort new life will be  infused into your small Baha'i group, and that it will in the near future  grow sufficiently in number to enable you to form an assembly the first to  be established in that land. We shall pray at the Holy Threshold for your  guidance and the success of your work.    The Greatest Holy Leaf and the Holy Mother remember you well, and they and  the other members of the family send their loving greetings to you.    You will be interested to know that the new pilgrim house is being  completed, and it will be all ready in a month time for the new pilgrims  that will come.    We still have our dear sister Effie Baker with us, and we all love her so;  she is so sweet and helpful.    We have just now two American lady friends with us, Auntie Victoria  Bedekian and Mrs R. Kehler--very fine Baha'is they are and we are  expecting some more soon.    I always remember the happy day I spent with you and Effy in London and  shall look forward to the pleasure of meeting you again some day--perhaps  here in Haifa or in New Zealand, who knows?    I am back at home now for the present, and I am trying to help Shoghi  Effendi a little in his enormous task.    He is keeping in good health I am glad to say in spite of his many  activities and heavy and manifold responsibilities.    To you he sends his brotherly love and the assurance of his prayers for  your welfare and happiness.    With all good wishes and loving greetings,    Your sister in His Service,  Ruh-Anguiz Rabbani    [From the Guardian:]    _My dear and precious Baha'i sister:_    _I cannot but add a few words personally expressing my deep appreciation  of your persistent, self-sacrificing services to the Cause. I have devoted  your gift towards the Fund for the Western Pilgrim House and I wish to  assure you that when I visit the Holy Shrines I tenderly supplicate for  you Divine Guidance and strength in your labours for our beloved Cause._    _Your true Brother, _  _ Shoghi_          (9) April 3rd, 1926      Dear Spiritual Sister:--    Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated  January 24, 1926.    He hopes that after this long vacation you have had you are ready to begin  spreading the Cause in New Zealand with even greater energy than before.  The people there seem to be broad in their outlook, receptive to any idea  which helps the human family from decreasing its burden.    Shoghi Effendi was most chagrined to hear of the sudden death of your  son(1) and wishes me to extend to you his deepest love and sympathy.    There is no special news here except that we have removed to the new  pilgrim house. Miss Baker is well and very busy entertaining the friends  and arranging the new home.    Shoghi Effendi as well as the other members of the family are well and  send you their love and greetings. They earnestly pray for your success  and hope to hear, before long, the news of your many victories in the  field of services to the Cause.    Please convey my loving greetings to your son and daughter.    Yours most sincerely,  Ruhi Afnan    [From the Guardian:]    _My dear fellow-worker:_    _I wish to express in person my deep sympathy in the heavy loss you have  sustained. May the Beloved Comforter strengthen you and sustain you in  your bereavement. The memory of your visit to the Holy Land is still fresh  and vivid in my mind and I pray and supplicate at the holy Shrines that  your labours in the Cause may yield an abundant harvest._    _Your sympathising brother, _  _ Shoghi_            PART II  LETTERS TO INDIVIDUALS, APRIL 21ST, 1926--APRIL 21ST, 1934.      The first combined National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Australia  and New Zealand was formed in 1934.          (10) August 12th, 1926      My very dear Spiritual Sister:    Shoghi Effendi has been in receipt of your interesting letter dated June  7, 1926. It is a great pity that your health has more or less handicapped  you in your service to the Cause. We, however, hope that this weakness  will soon vanish and your health and strength be fully restored.    The case of the teacher who has been in Palestine is one really to be  lamented.
