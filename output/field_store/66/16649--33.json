How beautifully the Thames winds! Ay! there is the grand stand at Epsom,  and there Twickenham, delicious, soft, balmy Twickenham; and Richmond  Hill--a very queen of beauty!                    [Illustration: REMAINS OF CHERTSEY ABBEY.]                            REMAINS OF CHERTSEY ABBEY.      Yonder, beyond the valley, are Foxes Hills crowned with lofty pines--and  that is the church at Staines, and as you turn, there again is Cooper's  Hill; Laleham seems spread as a tribute at your feet, and there is no end  to the villages and mansions--the parks, and cottages like snow-drops in a  parterre, and church spires more than we can number; while close behind us  are the stones piled thickly one on the other--the only relics of the holy  Chapel of St. Anne.    How grandly the promontory of St. George's Hill stands out--sheltering  Weybridge, and forming a beautiful back-ground to Byfleet and the banks of  the Way; not forgetting its ruins--a Roman encampment of two thousand years  age, and its modern ornaments of rare trees, of which a generous nobleman  has made common property, to be enjoyed daily by all who choose. At the  foot of this richly planted hill, is the beautiful park of Oatlands--on the  eve of becoming an assemblage of villa-grounds. How pleasant to feel that  we can account, by our own knowledge of that glowing mount, for all the  shades formed by the hills and hollows, and different growths of trees in  the depths or heights of \"the encampment,\" which forms the delight of many  a toilsome antiquary. Beyond are the more distant eminences of the North  Downs, and a tract of country extending into Kent. But we have not yet  explored the beauties of this our own hill of Chertsey; truly, to do so,  would take a day as long as that of its own black cherry fair.    A path to the left, among the fern and heather, leads to a well, famed for  its healing properties--it is called the Nun's Well; even now, the peasants  believe that its waters are a cure for diseases of the eye; the path is  steep and dangerous, and it is far pleasanter to walk round the brow of  the hill and overlook the dense wood which conceals the well, fringing the  meadows of Thorpe, than to seek its tangled hiding-place in the dell. The  monks of old would be sorely perplexed if they could arise, to account for  the long line of smoke which marks the passage of the different trains  along their railroads. But we turn from them to enjoy a ramble round the  brow of St. Anne's Hill; the coppice which clothes the descent into the  valley, is so thick, that though it is intersected by many paths, you  might lose yourself half-a-dozen times within an hour; if it be evening,  the nightingales in the thickets of Monksgrove have commenced their  chorus, and the town of Chertsey, down below, is seen to its full extent,  its church tower toned into beauty by the rich light of the setting sun,  while through the trees and holly thickets you obtain glimpses of the  Guildford and Leatherhead hills, so softly blue, that they meet and mingle  with the sky.                       [Illustration: GATE OF FOX'S HOUSE.]                               GATE OF FOX'S HOUSE.                    [Illustration: SUMMER HOUSE IN FOX'S GARDEN.]                          SUMMER HOUSE IN FOX'S GARDEN.                        [Illustration: TEMPLE OF FRIENDSHIP.]                              TEMPLE OF FRIENDSHIP.      Those who feel no interest in monkish chronicles, may reverence St. Anne's  Hill, because of its having been the favorite residence of Charles James  Fox, the contemporary of Pitt and Burke and Sheridan and Grattan, at a  period when men felt strongly and spoke eloquently. The site of the house  on the south-eastern site of the hill is extremely beautiful, and it is  much regretted in the neighborhood that it finds so little favor in the  heart of its present noble proprietor. The grounds are laid out with much  taste; there is a noble cedar planted by Mrs. Fox when only the size of a  wand. The statesman's widow survived her husband more than thirty-six  years, but never outlived her friends or her faculties. There is a temple  dedicated to Friendship, which was erected to perpetuate the coming of age  of one of the late Lords Holland; on a pedestal ornamented by a vase, are  inscribed some verses by General Fitzpatrick; another placed by Mrs. Fox  to mark a favorite spot where Mr. Fox loved to muse, is enriched by a  quotation from the \"Flower and the Leaf,\" concluded by two graceful  stanzas:      \"Cheerful in this sequestered bower,      From all the storms of life removed;    Here Fox enjoyed his evening hour,      In converse with the friends he loved.    And here these lines he oft would quote,      Pleased from his favorite poet's lay;    When challenged by the warbler's note,      That breathed a song from every spray.\"    At the bottom of the garden is a grotto, which must have once possessed  many attractions, and above it there is a pretty little quaint chamber  that was used as a tea-room, when, according to the custom of the time,  the English drank tea by daylight; it is adorned by painted glass windows;  there are portraits of the Prince of Wales and Mr. Fox, when both were  looking their best, and the balcony in front commands a delicious view of  the surrounding country.    The peasantry are still loud in their praise of \"Madam Fox;\" and some  remember with gratitude the education they received at her school, and  love to tell how the old lady was drawn there at \"feast times,\" to see how  they all looked in their new dresses. She certainly retained her sympathy  with the young, and put away the feelings and habits of old age with a  determined hand, for it is said, when she was eighty she took lessons on  the harp. The present generation remember personally nothing of the great  statesman; he has become history to us, and we must look to history,  garbled as it always is, and always will be, by the opinions and feelings  of its writers, to determine the position of Charles James Fox in the  annals of his country. Those who were admitted to his society have written  with enthusiasm of his social qualities, and bestow equal praise on his  brilliant talents, his affability of manner, and the generosity of his  disposition. He was the third son of Henry Fox, afterwards Lord Holland,  and his mother was the eldest daughter of Charles, second Duke of  Richmond, and consequently great-granddaughter to Charles II.; the  material descent is one of blotted royalty, of which a man like Fox could  not have been proud. His academic course was unmarked by any of those  honors of which Oxford men are so ambitious, and yet, like his great  rival, William Pitt, he became a statesman before he was of age.                           [Illustration: FOX'S ARBOR.]                                   FOX'S ARBOR.      At St. Anne's Hill he enjoyed as many intervals of repose and tranquillity  as could fall to a statesman's lot; in the time of wars and tumults, how  he must have luxuriated in its delicious quiet, surrounded by friends who  dearly loved him; and swayed only for good by the wife who (although it is  known that her early intimacy with him was such as prevented her general  recognition in society) according to the evidence of all who knew her, was  the minister only to his better thoughts and nobler ambitions, and who  weaned him from nearly all the follies and vices which stained his youth  and earlier manhood. Various causes led to his death, before age had added  infirmities to disease. He died at Chiswick House, and his last words,  addressed to Mrs. Fox were, \"I die happy.\" It is said he wished to be  buried at Chertsey, but his remains were interred in Westminister Abbey.    The brilliant Sheridan pronounced so elegant an eulogium on his character,  that it is pleasant to think of it in those shades where, as we have said,  he so often sought and found repose: \"When Mr. Fox ceased to live, the  cause of private honor and friendship lost its highest glory, public  liberty its most undaunted champion, and general humanity its most active  and ardent assertor. In him was united the most amiable disposition with  the most firm and resolute spirit; the mildest manners, with the most  exalted mind. With regard to that great man it might, indeed, be well  said, that in him the bravest heart and most exalted mind sat upon the  seat of gentleness.\"                          [Illustration: COWLEY'S SEAT.]                                  COWLEY'S SEAT.                     [Illustration: COWLEY'S HOUSE--STREET FRONT.]                           COWLEY'S HOUSE--STREET FRONT.      There is, at all events, an imaginary pleasure in turning from the wearing  out turmoil of a statesman's life, to what the world believes the tranquil  dreams of a poet's existence. But there are few things the worldling so  little understands as literary industry, or so little sympathizes with as  literary care. We have no inclination to over-rate either its toils or its  pleasures, and perhaps no life is more abundantly supplied with both. Its  toils must be evident to any who have noted the increasing literary labor  which is necessary to produce the ordinary sources of comforts; but its  high and holy enjoyments are not so apparent; they are so different from  those of almost all others as not to be easily explained or understood;  but above all other gifts, the marvellous gift of poesy is a distinction  conferred by the Almighty, and should be acknowledged and treasured as  such. We know little of a poet's studies except by their imperishable  produce, and it is a common but ill-founded prejudice to imagine  regularity or diligence incompatible with high genius.

It was a most merry summer day; all nature moving gladsomely to  the full music of life. The leaves were fluttering to each other, the  grasses sweeping up and down, the bobolinks hopping by the meadow path.    Their friend Winnie came out to meet them, looking rather astonished.    \"We're going to learn,\" shouted Lu, \"get on your bonnet.\"    \"But you wasn't good to me to-day,\" said Winnie, thoughtfully.    \"We didn't da'st to be,\" said Kathie, \"till we'd asked somebody that  knew.\"    Mrs. Tennyson was half of the mind to call her little daughter in; yet  she felt it a pity to be less sweet and forgiving than the child.    Winnie already had her class before her. \"Now you must do just as I do.  You must hold your dress back so,--not grab it, but hold it back nice,  and you must bend forward so, and you must point your slippers so,--not  stand flat.\"    Very graceful the little dancing-teacher looked, tip-toeing here,  gliding there, twinkling through a series of pretty steps down the long  garden walk.    But the pupils! Do the best she might, sturdy little Kathie couldn't  manage her dress. She grasped it tightly in either fat little fist.  \"Mother Bunch!\" Lu giggled behind her back.    Kathie's face got very red over that. It was well enough to be  \"Dumpling,\"--everybody loves a dumpling; but \"Mother Bunch!\" So she  bounced and shuffled a little longer, and then she said she was going  home.    But Miss Lu wasn't ready. She greatly liked the new fun, the hopping and  whirling to Winnie's steady \"One, two, _three!_ One, two, _three!_\"  There was a grown-up, affected smirk on her delicate little face, at  which Mrs. Tennyson laughed every time she looked out. I think Lu would  have hopped and minced up and down the walk until night, if Winnie's  mother hadn't told them it was time to go.    \"I don't like her old steps,\" said Kathie. They were sitting on a daisy  bank near Mr. Medway's.    \"Well, I do,\" said Lu. \"And you would, too, if you wasn't so chunked.  You just bounced up and down.\"    Kathie burst out crying. \"I'll bet dancing steps _is_ wicked, for you  never was so mean before in your life, so! And you didn't dance near so  pretty as Winnie, and you needn't think you ever will, for you _never_  will!\"    \"Oh! I won't, won't I?\" said Lu, teasingly.    \"No, you won't. I won't be wicked and say you are nice, for you're  horrid.\"    \"_You_'re wicked this minute, Kathie Dysart, for _you_'re mad.\"    And as she laughed a naughty laugh, and as Kathie glared back at her,  then it was that that which happened began to happen. Lu's delicate,  rosy mouth commenced drawing up at the corners in an ugly fashion, and  her nose commenced drawing down, while her dimpled chin thrust itself  out in a taunting manner; but the horror of it was that she couldn't  straighten her lips, nor could she draw in her chin when she tried.    \"You _dis'gree'ble_ thing!\" shrieked Kathie, looking at her and feeling  dreadfully, her eyebrows knotting up like two little squirming snakes.  \"If I'm a Mother Bunch, you're a bean-pole, and you'll be an ugly old  witch some day, and you'll dry up and you'll blow away.\"    By this time the two little pink starched sun-bonnets fairly stood on  end at each other.    \"Kathie Dysart, I'll tell your Sunday-school teacher, see if I don't.\"    \"Tell her what? you old, _old_, OLD thing!\"    [Illustration: \"They grew older and uglier each moment.\"]    Kathie Dysart loved her Sunday-school teacher, and now she _was_ in a  rage. She couldn't begin to scowl as fiercely as she felt; her cheeks  sunk in, her lips drew down, her nose grew sharp and long in the effort.  And, all at once, as the children say, her face \"froze\" so. Oh! it was  perfectly horrid, that which happened to the two little dears, it was  indeed. They could not possibly look away from each other, and they grew  older and uglier each moment! Why, their very sun-bonnets--those fresh  little pink sun-bonnets--shriveled into old women's caps, and even in  the hearts of the poor little old crones the hardening process was going  on, a fierce fire of hate scorching the last central drop of dew, until  nothing would ever, ever grow and bloom again.    It was all over with Lu and Kathie forever and ever.        All this was long ago, of course--indeed, it happened \"once upon a  time.\" It would be difficult now to verify each point in the account. On  the contrary, I suppose it just possible that there may be a mistake as  to the transformation of the children's clothes--the change of the  sun-bonnets into caps, for instance.    But, as a whole, I see no reason to doubt the story. Often, and quite  recently, too, I have seen little faces in danger of a similar  transformation.    Where anger, envy, spite, and some others of the ill-tempers, gain  control of the nerves and muscles of the human countenance, they pull  and twitch and knot and tie these nerves and muscles, until it is almost  impossible to recognize the face.    Sometimes this change has passed off in a minute; but at other times it  has lasted for hours, and there is _always_ danger that the face will  fail to recover its pleasantness wholly, that traces will remain, like  wrinkles in a ribbon that has been tied, and that, at last, the  transformation will be final and fatal, and the fair child become and  remain \"a horrid old witch.\"    Of one thing we all are certain--that the most gossiping and malicious  person now living was once a fair and innocent child; so who shall say  that this which I have related did _not_ happen to Lu and Kathie?          FLAXIE FRIZZLE.      Her name was Mary Gray, but they called her Flaxie Frizzle. She had  light curly hair, and a curly nose. That is, her nose curled up at the  end a wee bit, just enough to make it look cunning.    What kind of a child was she?    Well, I don't want to tell; but I suppose I shall have to. She wasn't  gentle and timid and sweet like you little darlings, oh, no! not like  you. And Mrs. Willard, who was there visiting from Boston, said she was  \"dreadful.\"    She was always talking at the table, for one thing.    \"Mamma,\" said she, one day, from her high chair, \"your littlest one  doesn't like fish; what makes you cook him?\"    Mamma shook her head, but Flaxie wouldn't look at it. Mrs. Willard was  saying, \"When we go to ride this afternoon we can stop at the  slate-quarry.\"    _Who_ was going to ride? And would they take the \"littlest one\" too?  Flaxie meant to find out.    [Illustration: Flaxie Frizzle.]    \"Do you love me, mamma?\" said she, beating her mug against her red  waiter.    \"When you are a good girl, Flaxie.\"    \"Well, look right in my eyes, mamma. Don't you see I _are_ a good girl?  And _mayn't_ I go a-riding?\"    \"Eat your dinner, Mary Gray, and don't talk.\"    Her mother never called her Mary Gray except when she was troublesome.    \"I want to tell you sumpin, mamma,\" whispered she, bending forward and  almost scalding herself against the teapot, \"I _won't_ talk; I won't  talk _a_ tall.\"    But it was of no use. Mrs. Willard was not fond of little girls, and  Mrs. Gray would not take Flaxie; she must stay at home with her sister  Ninny.    Now Ninny--or Julia--was almost ten years old, a dear, good, patient  little girl, who bore with Flaxie's naughtiness, and hardly ever  complained. But this afternoon, at four o'clock, her best friend, Eva  Snow, was coming, and Ninny did hope that by that time her mamma would  be at home again!    Mrs. Gray and Mrs. Willard rode off in the carriage; and the moment they  were gone, Flaxie began to frisk like a wild creature.    First she ran out to the gate, and screamed to a man going by,--    \"How d'ye do, Mr. Man? You _mustn't_ smoke! My mamma don't like it!\"    \"Oh, why _did_ you do that?\" said Ninny, her face covered with blushes,  as she darted after Flaxie, and brought her into the house.    \"Well, then, show me your new picture-book, and I won't.\"    As long as she was looking at pictures she was out of mischief, and  Ninny turned the leaves very patiently.    But soon the cat came into the room with the new kitten in her mouth,  and then Flaxie screamed with terror. She thought the cat was eating it  up for a mouse; but instead of that she dropped it gently on the sofa,  purring, and looking at the two little girls as if to say,--    \"Isn't it a nice baby?\"    Flaxie thought it was; you could see that by the way she kissed it. But  when she picked it up and marched about with it, the old cat mewed  fearfully.    \"Put it down,\" said Ninny. \"Don't you see how bad you make its mother  feel?\"    \"No. I's goin' to carry it over the bridge, and show it to my grandma;  she wants to see this kitty.\"    Ninny looked troubled. She hardly dared say Flaxie must not go, for fear  that would make her want to go all the more.    \"What a funny spot kitty has on its face,\" said she, \"white all over;  with a yellow star on its forehead.\"    \"Well,\" said Flaxie, \"I'll wash it off.\" And away she flew to the  kitchen sink.    \"What are you up to now?\" said Dora, the housemaid, who stood there with  her bonnet on. \"You'll drown that poor little creetur, and squeeze it to  death too! Miss Ninny, why don't you attend to your little sister?\"    Dear Ninny! as if she were not doing her best! And here it was  half-past three, and Eva Snow coming at four!    \"O Dodo!\" said she, \"you're not going off?\"    \"Only just round the corner, Miss Ninny. I'll be right back.\"    But it was a pity she should go out at all. Mrs. Gray did not suppose  she would leave the house while she was gone.    As soon as \"Dodo\" was out of sight, Flaxie thought she could have her  own way.    \"O Ninny! you're my darlin' sister,\" said she, with a very sweet smile.  \"Will you lem me carry my kitty over to grandma's?\"    \"Why, no indeed! You mustn't go 'way over the bridge.\"    "]]]
