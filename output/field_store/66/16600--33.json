(5) The specific figure of the _accompaniment_ is usually reproduced  from measure to measure (or group to group) throughout whole sections  of the piece.  Observe, in the 37th Song Without Words, how constantly  the ascending figure of six tones recurs in the lower part (left hand).  Glance also at No. 30; No. 1; No. 25.  Many other evidences of Unity  are invariably present in good music, so naturally and self-evidently  that they almost escape our notice.  Some of these are left to the  student's discernment; others will engage our joint attention in due  time.          *      *      *      *      *      *    In every one of these manifestations of unity there lies the germ of  the principle of Variety, which quickens into life with the action of  the former, always following, as offspring and consequence of the  primary unity.  Thus:--    (1) The _beats_, though uniform in duration, differ from each other in  force.  The first pulse in each measure (or metric group of any size)  is heavier, stronger, than the following.  It--the first--is the  \"impulse,\" and is what is called the accent.  This dynamic distinction  it is that gives rise to the two fundamental classes of rhythm, the  duple and triple.  In duple rhythm the accent is followed by one  unaccented or lighter beat, so that regular alternation of heavy and  light pulses prevails incessantly.  In triple rhythm the accent is  followed by _two_ lighter beats, creating similarly constant, but  _irregular_ alternation of heavy and light pulses.    [Illustration: Duple and Triple Rhythm]    This distinction is so significant and so striking, that the music  lover who is eager to gain the first clues to the structural purpose of  a composition, should endeavor to recognize which one of these two  rhythmic species underlies the movement to which he is listening.  It  is fairly certain to be one or the other continuously.  Of duple  measure, the march and polka are familiar examples; of triple measure,  the waltz and mazurka.  The \"regularity\" of the former rhythm imparts a  certain stability and squareness to the entire piece, while triple  rhythm is more graceful and circular in effect.    (2) The same dynamic distinction applies also to whole _measures_, and    (3) to _accents_.  The first of two successive measures, or of two or  more accents, is always a trifle heavier than the other.    (4) The _melodic contents_ of the first measure may be exactly  reproduced in the succeeding measure; but if this is the case, they are  very unlikely to appear still again in the next (third) measure, for  that would exaggerate the condition of Unity and create the effect of  monotony.    [Illustration: Example 1.  Fragment of Folk-song.]    The measure marked _b_ is exactly like _a_.  But _c_ is all the more  contrasting, on account of this similarity.    Or, the melodic contents of a measure may be thus reproduced, as far as  the rhythm and direction of the tones are concerned, but--for  variety--they may be shifted to a higher or lower place upon the staff,  or may be otherwise modified.    [Illustration: Example 2.  Fragment of Beethoven.]    Compare the groups marked _a_ and _b_, and observe how the principles  of unity and variety are both active in these four measures, and how  their effect is heightened by the formation of _c_.    (5) The figures of the accompaniment, though reproduced in uniform  rhythmic values and melodic direction, undergo constant modifications  in pitch and in shape, similar, to those shown in Ex. 2.  See, again,  No. 37 of the Songs Without Words and note the changes in the formation  of the otherwise uniform six-tone groups.

It is what passes while a piece of music is being played,  sung, or read.  It is like the area of the surface upon which the  musical structure is to be erected, and which is measured or divided  into so many units for this, so many for that, so many for the other  portion of the musical Form.  Time is that quantity which admits of the  necessary reduction to units (like the feet and inches of a yardstick),  whereby a System of Measurement is established that shall determine the  various lengths of the tones, define their rhythmic conditions, and  govern the co-operation of several melodies sung or played together.  Time is the canvas upon which the musical images are drawn--in melodic  _lines_.      TEMPO.--This refers to the degree of motion.  The musical picture is  not constant, but panoramic; we never hear a piece of music all at  once, but as a panorama of successive sounds.  Tempo refers to the rate  of speed with which the scroll passes before our minds.  Thus we speak  of rapid tempo (_allegro_, and the like), or slow tempo (_adagio_), and  so forth.      BEATS.--The beats are the units in our System of Measurement,--as it  were, the inches upon our yardstick of time; they are the particles of  time that we mark when we \"count,\" or that the conductor marks with the  \"beats\" of his baton.  Broadly speaking, the ordinary beat (in moderate  tempo) is about equivalent to a second of time; to less or more than  this, of course, in rapid or slow tempo.  Most commonly, the beat is  represented in written music by the quarter-note, as in 2-4, 3-4, 4-4,  6-4 measure.  But the composer is at liberty to adopt any value he  pleases (8th, 16th, half-note) as beat.  In the first study in  Clementi's \"Gradus ad Parnassum,\" the time-signature is 3-1, the whole  note as beat; in the 8th Sung Without Words it is 6-16, the sixteenth  note as beat; in the last pianoforte sonata of Beethoven (op. 111),  last movement, the time-signatures are 9-16, 6-16, and 12-32, the  latter being, probably, the smallest beat ever chosen.      MEASURES.--A measure is a group of beats.  The beats are added  together, in measures, to obtain a larger unit of time, because larger  divisions are more convenient for longer periods; just as we prefer to  indicate the dimensions of a house, or farm, in feet or rods, rather  than in inches.    Measures differ considerably in extent in various compositions,  inasmuch as the number of beats enclosed between the vertical bars may  be, and is, determined quite arbitrarily.  What is known as a Simple  measure contains either the two beats (heavy-light) of the fundamental  duple group, or the three beats (heavy-light-light) of the triple  group, shown in the preceding chapter.  Compound measures are such as  contain more than two or three beats, and they must always be  multiplications, or groups, of a Simple measure; for whether so small  as to comprise only the fundamental groups of two or three beats (as in  2-4, 3-8, 3-4 measure), or so large as to embrace as many as twelve  beats or more (as in 4-4, 6-4, 6-8, 9-8, 12-8 measure), the measure  represents, practically, either the duple or triple species, Simple or  Compound.  Thus, a measure of four beats, sometimes called (needlessly)  quadruple rhythm, is merely twice two beats; the species is actually  _duple_; the alternation of heavy and light pulses is regular; and  therefore the third beat is again an accent, as well as the first,  though _less heavy_.  A measure of 6-8 is triple species, with accents  at beats one and four, precisely as if an additional vertical bar were  inserted after the third beat.  In a word, then, the size of the  adopted measure is of no consequence, as long as it is retained  uniformly through the section to which it belongs; and there is no  _real_ difference between 2-4 and 4-4 measure, excepting in the number  of bars used.    A curious and rare exception to this rule of the compound measure  occurs when five or seven beats are grouped together.  This involves a  mingling of the duple and triple species, and, consequently, an  irregular disposition of the accents; for instance, 5-4 measure is  either 3+2 or 2+3 beats, with corresponding accentuation:    [Illustration: Beat accentuation]      RHYTHM.--This word signifies arrangement,--a principle applied, in  music, to the distribution or arrangement of the tones according to  their various _time-values_.  The system of measurement (or metric  system) furnishes tone material with all the details of division,  proportion and comparison; but this, alone, is not rhythm.  The metric  system affords the basis for rational and definable rhythm, but  \"rhythm\" itself does not enter"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19362"],[0,"In the Year 2889 (#3)"],[1,"silent.    \"A great deal,\" was the reply. \"If the Earth Chronicle would but open a  campaign on our behalf--\"    \"And for what object?\"    \"Simply for the annulment of the Act of Congress annexing to the United  States the British islands.\"    Though, by a just turn-about of things here below, Great Britain has  become a colony of the United States, the English are not yet reconciled  to the situation. At regular intervals they are ever addressing to the  American government vain complaints.    \"A campaign against the annexation that has been an accomplished fact  for 150 years!\" exclaimed Mr. Smith. \"How can your people suppose that  I would do anything so unpatriotic?\"    \"We at home think that your people must now be sated. The Monroe  doctrine is fully applied; the whole of America belongs to the  Americans. What more do you want? Besides, we will pay for what we ask.\"    \"Indeed!\" answered Mr. Smith, without manifesting the slightest  irritation. \"Well, you English will ever be the same. No, no, Sir John,  do not count on me for help. Give up our fairest province, Britain? Why  not ask France generously to renounce possession of Africa, that  magnificent colony the complete conquest of which cost her the labor of  800 years? You will be well received!\"    \"You decline! All is over then!\" murmured the British agent sadly. \"The  United Kingdom falls to the share of the Americans; the Indies to that  of--\"    \"The Russians,\" said Mr. Smith, completing the sentence.    \"Australia--\"    \"Has an independent government.\"    \"Then nothing at all remains for us!\" sighed Sir John, downcast.    \"Nothing?\" asked Mr. Smith, laughing. \"Well, now, there's Gibraltar!\"    With this sally the audience ended. The clock was striking twelve, the  hour of breakfast. Mr. Smith returns to his chamber. Where the bed stood  in the morning a table all spread comes up through the floor. For Mr.  Smith, being above all a practical man, has reduced the problem of  existence to its simplest terms. For him, instead of the endless suites  of apartments of the olden time, one room fitted with ingenious  mechanical contrivances is enough. Here he sleeps, takes his meals, in  short, lives.    He seats himself. In the mirror of the phonotelephote is seen the same  chamber at Paris which appeared in it this morning. A table furnished  forth is likewise in readiness here, for notwithstanding the difference  of hours, Mr. Smith and his wife have arranged to take their meals  simultaneously. It is delightful thus to take breakfast _tête-à-tête_  with one who is 3000 miles or so away. Just now, Mrs. Smith's chamber  has no occupant.    \"She is late! Woman's punctuality! Progress everywhere except there!\"  muttered Mr. Smith as he turned the tap for the first dish. For like all  wealthy folk in our day, Mr. Smith has done away with the domestic  kitchen and is a subscriber to the Grand Alimentation Company, which  sends through a great network of tubes to subscribers' residences all  sorts of dishes, as a varied assortment is always in readiness. A  subscription costs money, to be sure, but the _cuisine_ is of the best,  and the system has this advantage, that it does away with the pestering  race of the _cordons-bleus_. Mr. Smith received and ate, all alone, the  _hors-d'oeuvre_, _entrées_, _rôti_, and _legumes_ that constituted the  repast. He was just finishing the dessert when Mrs. Smith appeared in  the mirror of the telephote.    \"Why, where have you been?\" asked Mr. Smith through the telephone.    \"What! You are already at the dessert? Then I am late,\" she exclaimed,  with a winsome _naïveté_. \"Where have I been, you ask? Why, at my  dress-maker's. The hats are just lovely this season! I suppose I forgot  to note the time, and so am a little late.\"    \"Yes, a little,\" growled Mr. Smith; \"so little that I have already  quite finished breakfast. Excuse me if I leave you now, but I must be  going.\"    \"O certainly, my dear; good-by till evening.\"    Smith stepped into his air-coach, which was in waiting for him at a  window. \"Where do you wish to go, sir?\" inquired the coachman.    \"Let me see; I have three hours,\" Mr. Smith mused. \"Jack, take me to my  accumulator works at Niagara.\"    For Mr. Smith has obtained a lease of the great falls of Niagara. For  ages the energy developed by the falls went unutilized. Smith, applying  Jackson's invention, now collects this energy, and lets or sells it. His  visit to the works took more time than he had anticipated. It was four  o'clock when he returned home, just in time for the daily audience which  he grants to callers.    One readily understands how a man situated as Smith is must be beset  with requests of all kinds. Now it is an inventor needing capital; again  it is some visionary who comes to advocate a brilliant scheme which must  surely yield millions of profit. A choice has to be made between these  projects, rejecting the worthless, examining the questionable ones,  accepting the meritorious. To this work Mr. Smith devotes every day two  full hours.    The callers were fewer to-day than usual--only twelve of them. Of these,  eight had only impracticable schemes to propose. In fact, one of them  wanted to revive painting, an art fallen into desuetude owing to the  progress made in color-photography. Another, a physician, boasted that  he had discovered a cure for nasal catarrh! These impracticables were  dismissed in short order. Of the four projects favorably received, the  first was that of a young man whose broad forehead betokened his  intellectual power.    \"Sir, I am a chemist,\" he began, \"and as such I come to you.\"    \"Well!\"    \"Once the elementary bodies,\" said the young chemist, \"were held to be  sixty-two in number; a hundred years ago they were reduced to ten; now  only three remain irresolvable, as you are aware.\"    \"Yes, yes.\"    \"Well, sir, these also I will show to be composite. In a few months, a  few weeks, I shall have succeeded in solving the problem. Indeed, it may  take only a few days.\"    \"And then?\"    \"Then, sir, I shall simply have determined the absolute. All I want is  money enough to carry my research to a successful issue.\"    \"Very well,\" said Mr. Smith. \"And what will be the practical outcome of  your discovery?\"    \"The practical outcome? Why, that we shall be able to produce easily all  bodies whatever--stone, wood, metal, fibers--\"    \"And flesh and blood?\" queried Mr. Smith, interrupting him. \"Do you  pretend that you expect to manufacture a human being out and out?\"    \"Why not?\"    Mr. Smith advanced $100,000 to the young chemist, and engaged his  services for the Earth Chronicle laboratory.    The second of the four successful applicants, starting from experiments  made so long ago as the nineteenth century and again and again repeated,  had conceived the idea of removing an entire city all at once from one  place to another. His special project had to do with the city of  Granton, situated, as everybody knows, some fifteen miles inland. He  proposes to transport the city on rails and to change it into a  watering-place. The profit, of course, would be enormous. Mr. Smith,  captivated by the scheme, bought a half-interest in it.    \"As you are aware, sir,\" began applicant No. 3, \"by the aid of our solar  and terrestrial accumulators and transformers, we are able to make all  the seasons the same. I propose to do something better still. Transform  into heat a portion of the surplus energy at our disposal; send this  heat to the poles; then the polar regions, relieved of their snow-cap,  will become a vast territory available for man's use. What think you of  the scheme?\"    \"Leave your plans with me, and come back in a week. I will have them  examined in the meantime.\"    Finally, the fourth announced the early solution of a weighty scientific  problem. Every one will remember the bold experiment made a hundred  years ago by Dr. Nathaniel Faithburn. The doctor, being a firm believer  in human hibernation--in other words, in the possibility of our  suspending our vital functions and of calling them into action again  after a time--resolved to subject the theory to a practical test. To  this end, having first made his last will and pointed out the proper  method of awakening him; having also directed that his sleep was to  continue a hundred years to a day from the date of his apparent death,  he unhesitatingly put the theory to the proof in his own person. Reduced to the condition of a mummy, Dr. Faithburn was coffined and laid  in a tomb. Time went on. September 25th, 2889, being the day set for his  resurrection, it was proposed to Mr. Smith that he should permit the  second part of the experiment to be performed at his residence this  evening.    \"Agreed. Be here at ten o'clock,\" answered Mr. Smith; and with that the  day's audience was closed.    Left to himself, feeling tired, he lay down on an extension chair. Then,  touching a knob, he established communication with the Central Concert  Hall, whence our greatest _maestros_ send out to subscribers their  delightful successions of accords determined by recondite algebraic  formulas. Night was approaching. Entranced by the harmony, forgetful of  the hour, Smith did not notice that it was growing dark. It was quite  dark when he was aroused by the sound of a door opening. \"Who is there?\"  he asked, touching a commutator.    Suddenly, in consequence of the vibrations produced, the air became  luminous.    \"Ah! you, Doctor?\"    \"Yes,\" was the reply. \"How are you?\"    \"I am feeling well.\"    \"Good! Let me see your tongue. All right! Your pulse. Regular! And your  appetite?\"    \"Only passably good.\"    \"Yes, the stomach. There's the rub. You are over-worked. If your stomach  is out of repair, it must be mended. That requires study. We must think  about it.\"    \"In the meantime,\" said Mr. Smith, \"you will dine with me.\"    As in the morning, the table rose out of the floor. Again, as in the  morning,"]]]
