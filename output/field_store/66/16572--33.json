I will  not flatter in so serious and perilous a matter; and if in this you do  not see that I am your friend and most thoroughly your subject, there is  One to see and judge.    In fine, that I may not approach you empty-handed, blessed Father, I  bring with me this little treatise, published under your name, as a good  omen of the establishment of peace and of good hope. By this you may  perceive in what pursuits I should prefer and be able to occupy myself  to more profit, if I were allowed, or had been hitherto allowed, by your  impious flatterers. It is a small matter, if you look to its exterior,  but, unless I mistake, it is a summary of the Christian life put  together in small compass, if you apprehend its meaning. I, in my  poverty, have no other present to make you, nor do you need anything  else than to be enriched by a spiritual gift. I commend myself to your  Paternity and Blessedness, whom may the Lord Jesus preserve for ever.  Amen.    Wittenberg, 6th September, 1520.          CONCERNING CHRISTIAN LIBERTY    Christian faith has appeared to many an easy thing; nay, not a few even  reckon it among the social virtues, as it were; and this they do because  they have not made proof of it experimentally, and have never tasted of  what efficacy it is. For it is not possible for any man to write well  about it, or to understand well what is rightly written, who has not at  some time tasted of its spirit, under the pressure of tribulation; while  he who has tasted of it, even to a very small extent, can never  write, speak, think, or hear about it sufficiently. For it is a living  fountain, springing up into eternal life, as Christ calls it in John iv.    Now, though I cannot boast of my abundance, and though I know how poorly  I am furnished, yet I hope that, after having been vexed by various  temptations, I have attained some little drop of faith, and that I can  speak of this matter, if not with more elegance, certainly with more  solidity, than those literal and too subtle disputants who have hitherto  discoursed upon it without understanding their own words. That I may  open then an easier way for the ignorant--for these alone I am trying  to serve--I first lay down these two propositions, concerning spiritual  liberty and servitude:--    A Christian man is the most free lord of all, and subject to none; a  Christian man is the most dutiful servant of all, and subject to every  one.    Although these statements appear contradictory, yet, when they are found  to agree together, they will make excellently for my purpose. They are  both the statements of Paul himself, who says, \"Though I be free from  all men, yet have I made myself servant unto all\" (1 Cor. ix. 19), and  \"Owe no man anything, but to love one another\" (Rom. xiii. 8). Now love  is by its own nature dutiful and obedient to the beloved object. Thus  even Christ, though Lord of all things, was yet made of a woman; made  under the law; at once free and a servant; at once in the form of God  and in the form of a servant.    Let us examine the subject on a deeper and less simple principle. Man is  composed of a twofold nature, a spiritual and a bodily. As regards the  spiritual nature, which they name the soul, he is called the spiritual,  inward, new man; as regards the bodily nature, which they name the  flesh, he is called the fleshly, outward, old man. The Apostle speaks of  this: \"Though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day  by day\" (2 Cor. iv. 16). The result of this diversity is that in the  Scriptures opposing statements are made concerning the same man,  the fact being that in the same man these two men are opposed to one  another; the flesh lusting against the spirit, and the spirit against  the flesh (Gal. v. 17).    We first approach the subject of the inward man, that we may see by what  means a man becomes justified, free, and a true Christian; that is, a  spiritual, new, and inward man. It is certain that absolutely none  among outward things, under whatever name they may be reckoned, has any  influence in producing Christian righteousness or liberty, nor, on the  other hand, unrighteousness or slavery. This can be shown by an easy  argument.    What can it profit the soul that the body should be in good condition,  free, and full of life; that it should eat, drink, and act according to  its pleasure; when even the most impious slaves of every kind of vice  are prosperous in these matters? Again, what harm can ill-health,  bondage, hunger, thirst, or any other outward evil, do to the soul,  when even the most pious of men and the freest in the purity of their  conscience, are harassed by these things? Neither of these states of  things has to do with the liberty or the slavery of the soul.    And so it will profit nothing that the body should be adorned with  sacred vestments, or dwell in holy places, or be occupied in sacred  offices, or pray, fast, and abstain from certain meats, or do whatever  works can be done through the body and in the body. Something widely  different will be necessary for the justification and liberty of the  soul, since the things I have spoken of can be done by any impious  person, and only hypocrites are produced by devotion to these things. On  the other hand, it will not at all injure the soul that the body should  be clothed in profane raiment, should dwell in profane places, should  eat and drink in the ordinary fashion, should not pray aloud, and  should leave undone all the things above mentioned, which may be done by  hypocrites.    And, to cast everything aside, even speculation, meditations, and  whatever things can be performed by the exertions of the soul itself,  are of no profit. One thing, and one alone, is necessary for life,  justification, and Christian liberty; and that is the most holy word of  God, the Gospel of Christ, as He says, \"I am the resurrection and the  life; he that believeth in Me shall not die eternally\" (John xi. 25),  and also, \"If the Son shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed\"  (John viii. 36), and, \"Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every  word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God\" (Matt. iv. 4).    Let us therefore hold it for certain and firmly established that the  soul can do without everything except the word of God, without which  none at all of its wants are provided for. But, having the word, it is  rich and wants for nothing, since that is the word of life, of truth, of  light, of peace, of justification, of salvation, of joy, of liberty, of  wisdom, of virtue, of grace, of glory, and of every good thing. It is  on this account that the prophet in a whole Psalm (Psalm cxix.), and in  many other places, sighs for and calls upon the word of God with so many  groanings and words.    Again, there is no more cruel stroke of the wrath of God than when He  sends a famine of hearing His words (Amos viii. 11), just as there is  no greater favour from Him than the sending forth of His word, as it is  said, \"He sent His word and healed them, and delivered them from their  destructions\" (Psalm cvii. 20). Christ was sent for no other office than  that of the word; and the order of Apostles, that of bishops, and that  of the whole body of the clergy, have been called and instituted for no  object but the ministry of the word.    But you will ask, What is this word, and by what means is it to be used,  since there are so many words of God? I answer, The Apostle Paul (Rom.  i.) explains what it is, namely the Gospel of God, concerning His Son,  incarnate, suffering, risen, and glorified, through the Spirit, the  Sanctifier. To preach Christ is to feed the soul, to justify it, to set  it free, and to save it, if it believes the preaching. For faith alone  and the efficacious use of the word of God, bring salvation. \"If thou  shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine  heart that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved\" (Rom.  x. 9); and again, \"Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to  every one that believeth\" (Rom. x. 4), and \"The just shall live by  faith\" (Rom. i. 17). For the word of God cannot be received and honoured  by any works, but by faith alone. Hence it is clear that as the soul  needs the word alone for life and justification, so it is justified by  faith alone, and not by any works. For if it could be justified by any  other means, it would have no need of the word, nor consequently of  faith.    But this faith cannot consist at all with works; that is, if you imagine  that you can be justified by those works, whatever they are, along with  it. For this would be to halt between two opinions, to worship Baal, and  to kiss the hand to him, which is a very great iniquity, as Job says.  Therefore, when you begin to believe, you learn at the same time that  all that is in you is utterly guilty, sinful, and damnable, according to  that saying, \"All have sinned, and come short of the glory of God\" (Rom.  iii. 23), and also: \"There is none righteous, no, not one; they are all  gone out of the way; they are together become unprofitable: there is  none that doeth good, no, not one\" (Rom. iii. 10-12). When you have  learnt this, you will know that Christ is necessary for you, since He  has suffered and risen again for you, that, believing on Him, you might  by this faith become another man, all your sins being remitted, and you  being justified by the merits of another, namely of Christ alone.    Since then this faith can reign only in the inward man, as it is said,  \"With the heart man believeth unto righteousness\" (Rom. x. 10); and  since it alone justifies, it is evident that by no outward work or  labour can the inward man be at all justified, made free, and saved; and  that no works whatever have any relation to him. And so, on the other  hand, it is solely by impiety and incredulity of heart that he becomes  guilty and a slave of sin, deserving"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19115"],[0,"Roman Britain in 1914 (#3)"],[1,"pulled down at Ribchester, and the Manchester Classical Association was  able to resume its examination of the Principia (praetorium) of the  Roman fort, above a part of which this building had stood. The work was  carried out by Prof. W. B. Anderson, of Manchester University, and Mr.  D. Atkinson, Research Fellow of Reading College, and, though limited in  extent, was very successful.    The first discovery of the Principia is due to Miss Greenall, who about  1905 was building a house close to the school and took care that certain  remains found by her builders should be duly noted: excavations in  1906-7, however, left the size and extent of these remains somewhat  uncertain and resulted in what we now know to be an incorrect plan. The  work done last spring makes it plain (fig. 3) that the Principia  fronted--in normal fashion--the main street of the fort (gravel laid on  cobbles) running from the north to the south gate. But, abnormally, the  frontage was formed by a verandah or colonnade: the only parallel which  I can quote is from Caersws, where excavations in 1909 revealed a  similar verandah in front of the Principia[2]. Next to the verandah  stood the usual Outer Court with a colonnade round it and two wells in  it (one is the usual provision): the colonnade seemed to have been twice  rebuilt. Beyond that are fainter traces of the Inner Court which,  however, lies mostly underneath a churchyard: the only fairly clear  feature is a room (A on plan) which seems to have stood on the right  side of the Inner Court, as at Chesters and Ambleside (fig. 2, above).  Behind this, probably, stood the usual five office rooms. If we carry  the Principia about 20 feet further back, which would be a full  allowance for these rooms with their walling, the end of the whole  structure will line with the ends of the granaries found some years ago.  This, or something very like it, is what we should naturally expect. We  then obtain a structure measuring 81 x 112 feet, the latter dimension  including a verandah 8 feet wide. This again seems a reasonable result.  Ribchester was a large fort, about 6 acres, garrisoned by cavalry;  in a similar fort at Chesters, on Hadrian's Wall, the Principia measured  85 x 125 feet: in the 'North Camp' at Camelon, another fort of much the  same size (nearly 6 acres), they measured 92 x 120 feet.    [Footnote 2: I saw this verandah while open. The whole excavations at  Caersws yielded important results and it is more than regrettable that  no report of them has ever been issued.]    [Illustration: FIG. 3. RIBCHESTER FORT, HEAD-QUARTERS]    (xi) _Slack._ The excavation of the Roman fort at Slack, near  Huddersfield, noted in my report for 1913 (p. 14), was continued in 1914  by Mr. P. W. Dodd and Mr. A. M. Woodward, lecturers in Leeds University,  which is doing good work in the exploration of southern Yorkshire. The  defences of the fort, part of its central buildings (fig. 4, I-III), and  part of its other buildings (B-K) have now been attacked. The defences  consist of (1) a ditch 15 feet wide, possibly double on the north (more  exactly north-west) side and certainly absent on the southern two-thirds  of the east (north-east) side; (2) a berme, 8 feet wide; and (3) a  rampart 20-5 feet thick, built of turf and strengthened by a rough stone  base which is, however, only 8-10 feet wide. Of the four gates, three  (west, north, and east) have been examined; all are small and have  wooden gate-posts instead of masonry. On each side of the east gate,  which is the widest (15 ft.), the rampart is thought to thicken as if  for greater defence. The absence of a ditch on the southern two-thirds  of the east side may be connected with some paving outside the east gate  and also with a bath-house, partly explored in 1824 and 1865, outside  the south-east (east) corner; we may think that here was an annexe. The  central buildings, so far as uncovered, are of stone; the Principia  (III) perhaps had some wooden partitions. They are all ill-preserved and  call for no further comment. West of them, in the rear of the fort, the  excavators traced two long narrow wooden buildings (B, C), north of the  road from the west (south-west) gate to the back of the Principia; on  the other side of the road they found the ends of two similar buildings  (D, E). This looks as if this portion of the fort was filled with four  barracks. On the other side of the row of buildings I-III remains  were traced of stone structures; one of these (F) had the L-shape  characteristic of barracks, and indications point to two others (G, H)  of the same shape. This implies six barrack buildings in this portion  of the fort and ten barrack buildings in all, that is, a cohort 1,000  strong. But the whole fort is only just 3 acres, and one would expect a  smaller garrison; when excavations have advanced, we may perhaps find  that the garrison was really a _cohors quingenaria_ with six barracks,  as at Gellygaer. Close against the east rampart, and indeed cutting  somewhat into it, was a long thin building (K), 12-16 feet wide, which  yielded much charcoal and potsherds and seemed an addition to the  original plan of the fort.    [Illustration: FIG. 4. PART OF SLACK FORT    (I. Granaries; II. Doubtful; III. Head-quarters; A. Shrine in III; B, C,  D, E. Wooden buildings in western part of fort; F, G, H, K. Stone  buildings in eastern part)]    The few small finds included Samian of the late first and early second  centuries (but no '29'), and a denarius of Trajan. In respect of date,  they agree with the finds of last year and of 1865, and suggest that  the fort was established under Domitian or Trajan, and abandoned under  Hadrian or Pius; as an inscription of the Sixth Legion was found here in  1744, apparently in the baths, the evacuation cannot have been earlier  than about A.D. 130. The occupation of Slack must therefore have  resembled that of Castleshaw, which stands at the western end of the  pass through the Pennine Hills, which Slack guards on the east. If this  be so, an explanation must be discovered for two altars generally  assigned to Slack. One of these, found three miles north of Slack at  Greetland in 1597 among traces of buildings, is dated to A.D. 205 (CIL.  vii. 200). The other, found two miles eastwards, at Longwood, in 1880  (Eph. Epigr. vii. 920), bears no date; but it was erected by an Aurelius  Quintus to the Numina Augustorum, and neither item quite suits so early  a date as the reign of Trajan. The dedication of the first is to the  goddess Victoria--_Vic_(_toria_) _Brig_(_antia_)--that of the second  _deo Berganti_ (as well as the _Numina Aug._); so that in each case a  local shrine to a native deity may be concerned. It is also possible  that a fort was built near Greetland, after the abandonment of Slack,  to guard another pass over the Pennine, that by way of Blackstone Edge.    It is to be hoped that these interesting excavations may be continued  and completed.    (xii) _Holt._ At Holt, eight miles south of Chester on the Denbighshire  bank of the Dee, Mr. Arthur Acton has further explored the very  interesting tile and pottery works of the Twentieth Legion, of which I  spoke in my Report for 1913 (p. 15). The site is not even yet exhausted.  But enough has been discovered to give a definite picture of it, and as  it may perhaps not be possible to continue the excavations at present,  and as the detailed report which Mr. Acton projects may take time to  issue, I shall try here, with his permission, to summarize very briefly  his most noteworthy results. I have to thank him for supplying me with  much information and material for illustrations.    Holt combines the advantages of excellent clay for pottery and tile  making,[3] good building stone (the Bunter red sandstone), and an easy  waterway to Chester. Here the legion garrisoning Chester established, in  the latter part of the first century, tile and pottery works for its own  use and presumably also for the use of other neighbouring garrisons.  Traces of these works were noted early in the seventeenth century,  though they were not then properly understood.[4] In 1905 the late Mr.  A. N. Palmer, of Wrexham, identified the site in two fields called Wall  Lock and Hilly Field, just outside the village of Holt, and here, since  1906, Mr. Acton has, at his own cost, carefully and systematically  carried out excavations.    [Footnote 3: A Bronze Age burial (fig. 6, D) suggests that the clay may  have been worked long before the Romans.]    [Footnote 4: References are given by Watkin, _Cheshire_, p. 305,  and Palmer, _Archaeologia Cambrensis_, 1906, pp. 225 foll.]    [Illustration: FIG. 5. ROMAN SITE NEAR HOLT    (1. Barracks?; 2. Dwelling and Bath-house; 3. Kiln; 4. Drying-room, &c.  5. Kilns; 6. Work-rooms?; 7. Clay-pits)]    The discoveries show a group of structures scattered along a bank about  a quarter of a mile in length which stands slightly above the Dee and  the often flooded meadows beside it (fig. 5). At the west end of this  area (fig. 5, no. 1, and fig. 6) was a large rectangular enclosure of  about 62 x 123 yards (rather over 1-1/2 acres), girt with a strong wall  7 feet thick. Within it were five various rows of rooms mostly 15 feet  square, with drains; some complicated masonry (? latrines) filled the  east end. This enclosure was not wholly explored; it may have served  for workmen's barracks; the contents of two rubbish-pits (fig. 6,  AA)--bones of edible animals, cherry-stones, shells of snails, and Dee  mussels, potsherds, &c.--had a domestic look; mill-stones for grinding  corn, including one bearing what seems to be a centurial mark, and  fragments of buff imported amphorae were also found here. Between this  enclosure and the river were two small buildings close together (fig.  5, no. 2 and fig. 7). The easternmost of these seems to have been a  dwelling-house 92 feet long, with a corridor and two hypocausts; it may  have"]]]
