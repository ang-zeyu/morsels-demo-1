He walked  from dawn to eve, indifferent to fatigue, hunger, and thirst; the sun  was already low on the horizon when he saw the dreadful river, the  blood-red waters of which rolled between the rocks of gold and fire.    He kept along the shore, begging his bread at the door of solitary  huts for the love of God, and joyfully receiving insults, refusals, or  threats. He feared neither robbers nor wild beasts, but he took great  care to avoid all the towns and villages he came near. He was afraid  lest he should see children playing at knuckle-bones before their  father's house, or meet, by the side of the well, women in blue smocks,  who might put down their pitcher and smile at him. All things are  dangerous for the hermit; it is sometimes a danger for him to read in  the Scriptures that the Divine Master journeyed from town to town and  supped with His disciples. The virtues that the anchorites embroider so  carefully on the tissue of faith, are as fragile as they are beautiful;  a breath of ordinary life may tarnish their pleasant colours. For that  reason, Paphnutius avoided the towns, fearing lest his heart should  soften at the sight of his fellow men.    He journeyed along lonely roads. When evening came, the murmuring of the  breeze amidst the tamarisk trees made him shiver, and he pulled his hood  over his eyes that he might not see how beautiful all things were. After  walking six days, he came to a place called Silsile. There the  river runs in a narrow valley, bordered by a double chain of granite  mountains. It was there that the Egyptians, in the days when they  worshipped demons, carved their idols. Paphnutius saw an enormous sphinx  carved in the solid rock. Fearing that it might still possess some  diabolical properties, he made the sign of the cross, and pronounced the  name of Jesus; he immediately saw a bat fly out of one of the monster's  ears, and Paphnutius knew that he had driven out the evil spirits which  had been for centuries in the figure. His zeal increased, and picking up  a large stone, he threw it in the idol's face. Then the mysterious face  of the sphinx expressed such profound sadness that Paphnutius was moved.  In fact, the expression of superhuman grief on the stone visage would  have touched even the most unfeeling man. Therefore Paphnutius said to  the sphinx--    \"O monster, be like the satyrs and centaurs our father Anthony saw in  the desert, and confess the divinity of Jesus Christ, and I will bless  thee in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.\"    When he had spoken a rosy light gleamed in the eyes of the sphinx; the  heavy eyelids of the monster quivered and the granite lips painfully  murmured, as though in echo to the man's voice, the holy name of Jesus  Christ; therefore Paphnutius stretched out his right hand, and blessed  the sphinx of Silsile.    That being done, he resumed his journey, and the valley having grown  wider, he saw the ruins of an immense city. The temples, which still  remained standing, were supported by idols which served as columns,  and--by the permission of God--these figures with women's heads and  cow's horns, threw on Paphnutius a long look which made him turn pale.  He walked thus seventeen days, his only food a few raw herbs, and  he slept at night in some ruined palace, amongst the wild cats and  Pharaoh's rats, with which mingled sometimes, women whose bodies ended  in a scaly tail. But Paphnutius knew that these women came from hell,  and he drove them away by making the sign of the cross.    On the eighteenth day, he found, far from any village, a wretched hut  made of palm leaves, and half buried under the sand which had been  driven by the desert wind. He approached it, hoping that the hut was  inhabited by some pious anchorite. He saw inside the hovel--for there  was no door--a pitcher, a bunch of onions, and a bed of dried leaves.    \"This must be the habitation of a hermit,\" he said to himself. \"Hermits  are generally to be found near their hut, and I shall not fail to meet  this one. I will give him the kiss of peace, even as the holy Anthony  did when he came to the hermit Paul, and kissed him three times. We will  discourse of things eternal, and perhaps our Lord will send us, by one  of His ravens, a crust of bread, which my host will willingly invite me  to share with him.\"    Whilst he was thus speaking to himself, he walked round the hut to see  if he could find any one. He had not walked a hundred paces when he saw  a man seated, with his legs crossed, by the side of the river. The man  was naked; his hair and beard were quite white, and his body redder than  brick. Paphnutius felt sure this must be the hermit. He saluted him with  the words the monks are accustomed to use when they meet each other.    \"Peace be with you, brother! May you some day taste the sweet joys of  paradise.\"    The man did not reply. He remained motionless, and appeared not to have  heard. Paphnutius supposed this was due to one of those rhapsodies to  which the saints are accustomed. He knelt down, with his hands joined,  by the side of the unknown, and remained thus in prayer till sunset.  Then, seeing that his companion had not moved, he said to him--    \"Father, if you are now out of the ecstasy in which you were lost, give  me your blessing in our Lord Jesus Christ.\"    The other replied without turning his head--    \"Stranger, I understand you not, and I know not the Lord Jesus Christ.\"    \"What!\" cried Paphnutius. \"The prophets have announced Him; legions of  martyrs have confessed His name; Caesar himself has worshipped Him, and,  but just now, I made the sphinx of Silsile proclaim His glory. Is it  possible that you do not know Him?\"    \"Friend,\" replied the other, \"it is possible. It would even be certain,  if anything in this world were certain.\"    Paphnutius was surprised and saddened by the incredible ignorance of the  man.    \"If you know not Jesus Christ,\" he said, \"all your works serve no  purpose, and you will never rise to life immortal.\"    The old man replied--    \"It is useless to act, or to abstain from acting. It matters not whether  we live or die.\"    \"Eh, what?\" asked Paphnutius. \"Do you not desire to live through all  eternity? But, tell me, do you not live in a hut in the desert as the  hermits do?\"    \"It seems so.\"    \"Do I not see you naked, and lacking all things?\"    \"It seems so.\"    \"Do you not feed on roots, and live in chastity?\"    \"It seems so.\"    \"Have you not renounced all the vanities of this world?\"    \"I have truly renounced all those vain things for which men commonly  care.\"    \"Then you are like me, poor, chaste, and solitary. And you are  not so--as I am--for the love of God, and with a hope of celestial  happiness! That I cannot understand. Why are you virtuous if you do not  believe in Jesus Christ? Why deprive yourself of the good things of this  world if you do not hope to gain eternal riches in heaven?\"    \"Stranger, I deprive myself of nothing which is good, and I flatter  myself that I have found a life which is satisfactory enough, though--to  speak more precisely--there is no such thing as a good or evil life.  Nothing is itself, either virtuous or shameful, just or unjust, pleasant  or painful, good or bad. It is our opinion which gives those qualities  to things, as salt gives savour to meats.\"    \"So then, according to you there is no certainty. You deny the truth  which the idolaters themselves have sought. You lie in ignorance--like a  tired dog sleeping in the mud.\"    \"Stranger, it is equally useless to abuse either dogs or philosophers.  We know not what dogs are or what we are. We know nothing.\"    \"Old man, do you belong, then, to the absurd sect of sceptics? Are you  one of those miserable fools who alike deny movement and rest, and who  know not how to distinguish between the light of the sun and the shadows  of night?\"    \"Friend, I am truly a sceptic, and of a sect which appears praiseworthy  to me, though it seems ridiculous to you. For the same things often  assume different appearances. The pyramids of Memphis seem at sunrise to  be cones of pink light. At sunset they look like black triangles against  the illuminated sky. But who shall solve the problem of their true  nature? You reproach me with denying appearances, when, in fact,  appearances are the only realities I recognise. The sun seems to me  illuminous, but its nature is unknown to me. I feel that fire burns--but  I know not how or why. My friend, you understand me badly. Besides, it  is indifferent to me whether I am understood one way or the other.\"    \"Once more. Why do you live on dates and onions in the desert? Why do  you endure great hardships? I endure hardships equally great, and, like  you, I live in abstinence and solitude. But then it is to please God,  and to earn eternal happiness. And that is a reasonable object, for  it is wise to suffer now for a future gain. It is senseless, on the  contrary, to expose yourself voluntarily to useless fatigue and vain  sufferings. If I did not believe--pardon my blasphemy, O uncreated  Light!--if I did not believe in the truth of that which God has taught  us by the voice of the prophets, by the example of His Son, by the acts  of the Apostles, by the authority of councils, and by the testimony  of the martyrs,--if I did not know that the sufferings of the body are  necessary for the salvation of the soul--if I were, like thee, lost in  ignorance of sacred mysteries--I would return at once amongst the men of  this day, I would strive to acquire riches, that I might live in ease,  like those who are happy in this world, and I would say to the votaries  of pleasure, 'Come, my daughters, come, my servants, come and pour out  for me your wines, your philtres, your perfumes.'

Situated half-way up the Alm, the cottage was luckily protected from  the mighty winds. Had it been exposed to the tempests, it would have  been a doubtful habitation in the state of decay it was in. Even as it  was, the doors and windows rattled and the old rafters shook when the  south wind swept the mountain side. If the hut had stood on the Alm  top, the wind would have blown it down the valley without much ado  when the storm season came.    Here lived Peter the goatherd, a boy eleven years old, who daily  fetched the goats from the village and drove them up the mountain to  the short and luscious grasses of the pastures. Peter raced down in  the evening with the light-footed little goats. When he whistled  sharply through his fingers, every owner would come and get his or her  goat. These owners were mostly small boys and girls and, as the goats  were friendly, they did not fear them. That was the only time Peter  spent with other children, the rest of the day the animals were his  sole companions. At home lived his mother and an old blind  grandmother, but he only spent enough time in the hut to swallow his  bread and milk for breakfast and the same repast for supper. After  that he sought his bed to sleep. He always left early in the morning  and at night he came home late, so that he could be with his friends  as long as possible. His father had met with an accident some years  ago; he also had been called Peter the goatherd. His mother, whose  name was Brigida, was called \"Goatherd Peter's wife\" and his blind  grandmother was called by young and old from many miles about just  \"grandmother.\"    Deta waited about ten minutes to see if the children were coming up  behind with the goats. As she could not find them anywhere, she  climbed up a little higher to get a better view down the valley from  there, and peered from side to side with marks of great impatience on  her countenance.    The children in the meantime were ascending slowly in a zigzag way,  Peter always knowing where to find all sorts of good grazing places  for his goats where they could nibble. Thus they strayed from side to  side. The poor little girl had followed the boy only with the greatest  effort and she was panting in her heavy clothes. She was so hot and  uncomfortable that she only climbed by exerting all her strength. She  did not say anything but looked enviously at Peter, who jumped about  so easily in his light trousers and bare feet. She envied even more  the goats that climbed over bushes, stones, and steep inclines with  their slender legs. Suddenly sitting down on the ground the child  swiftly took off her shoes and stockings. Getting up she undid the  heavy shawl and the two little dresses. Out she slipped without more  ado and stood up in only a light petticoat. In sheer delight at the  relief, she threw up her dimpled arms, that were bare up to her short  sleeves. To save the trouble of carrying them, her aunt had dressed  her in her Sunday clothes over her workday garments. Heidi arranged  her dresses neatly in a heap and joined Peter and the goats. She was  now as light-footed as any of them. When Peter, who had not paid much  attention, saw her suddenly in her light attire, he grinned. Looking  back, he saw the little heap of dresses on the ground and then he  grinned yet more, till his mouth seemed to reach from ear to ear; but  he said never a word.    The child, feeling free and comfortable, started to converse with  Peter, and he had to answer many questions. She asked him how many  goats he had, and where he led them, what he did with them when he got  there, and so forth.       [Illustration: SHE UNDID THE HEAVY SHAWL AND THE TWO LITTLE     DRESSES]    At last the children reached the summit in front of the hut. When Deta  saw the little party of climbers she cried out shrilly: \"Heidi, what  have you done? What a sight you are! Where are your dresses and your  shawl? Are the new shoes gone that I just bought for you, and the new  stockings that I made myself? Where are they all, Heidi?\"    The child quietly pointed down and said \"There.\"    The aunt followed the direction of her finger and descried a little  heap with a small red dot in the middle, which she recognized as the  shawl.    \"Unlucky child!\" Deta said excitedly. \"What does all this mean? Why  have you taken your things all off?\"    \"Because I do not need them,\" said the child, not seeming in the least  repentant of her deed.    \"How can you be so stupid, Heidi? Have you lost your senses?\" the aunt  went on, in a tone of mingled vexation and reproach. \"Who do you think  will go way down there to fetch those things up again? It is  half-an-hour's walk. Please, Peter, run down and get them. Do not  stand and stare at me as if you were glued to the spot.\"    \"I am late already,\" replied Peter, and stood without moving from the  place where, with his hands in his trousers' pockets, he had witnessed  the violent outbreak of Heidi's aunt.    \"There you are, standing and staring, but that won't get you further,\"  said Deta. \"I'll give you this if you go down.\" With that she held a  five-penny-piece under his eyes. That made Peter start and in a great  hurry he ran down the straightest path. He arrived again in so short a  time that Deta had to praise him and gave him her little coin without  delay. He did not often get such a treasure, and therefore his face  was beaming and he laughingly dropped the money deep into his pocket.    \"If you are going up to the uncle, as we are, you can carry the pack  till we get there,\" said Deta. They still had to climb a steep ascent  that lay behind Peter's hut. The boy readily took the things and  followed Deta, his left arm holding the bundle and his right swinging  the stick. Heidi jumped along gaily by his side with the goats.    After three quarters of an hour they reached the height where the hut  of the old man stood on a prominent rock, exposed to every wind, but  bathed in the full sunlight. From there you could gaze far down into  the valley. Behind the hut stood three old fir-trees with great shaggy  branches. Further back the old grey rocks rose high and sheer. Above  them you could see green and fertile pastures, till at last the stony  boulders reached the bare, steep cliffs.    Overlooking the valley the uncle had made himself a bench, by the side  of the hut. Here he sat, with his pipe between his teeth and both  hands resting on his knees. He quietly watched the children climbing  up with the goats and Aunt Deta behind them, for the children had  caught up to her long ago. Heidi reached the top first, and  approaching the old man she held out her hand to him and said: \"Good  evening, grandfather!\"    \"Well, well, what does that mean?\" replied the old man in a rough  voice. Giving her his hand for only a moment, he watched her with a  long and penetrating look from under his bushy brows. Heidi gazed back  at him with an unwinking glance and examined him with much curiosity,  for he was strange to look at, with his thick, grey beard and shaggy  eyebrows, that met in the middle like a thicket.    Heidi's aunt had arrived in the meantime with Peter, who was eager to  see what was going to happen.    \"Good-day to you, uncle,\" said Deta as she approached. \"This is  Tobias's and Adelheid's child. You won't be able to remember her,  because last time you saw her she was scarcely a year old.\"    \"Why do you bring her here?\" asked the uncle, and turning to Peter he  said: \"Get away and bring my goats. How late you are already!\"    Peter obeyed and disappeared on the spot; the uncle had looked at him  in such a manner that he was glad to go.    \"Uncle, I have brought the little girl for you to keep,\" said Deta. \"I  have done my share these last four years and now it is your turn to  provide for her.\"    The old man's eyes flamed with anger. \"Indeed!\" he said. \"What on  earth shall I do, when she begins to whine and cry for you? Small  children always do, and then I'll be helpless.\"    \"You'll have to look out for that!\" Deta retorted. \"When the little  baby was left in my hands a few years ago, I had to find out how to  care for the little innocent myself and nobody told me anything. I  already had mother on my hands and there was plenty for me to do. You  can't blame me if I want to earn some money now. If you can't keep the  child, you can do with her whatever you please. If she comes to harm  you are responsible and I am sure you do not want to burden your  conscience any further.\"    Deta had said more in her excitement than she had intended, just  because her conscience was not quite clear. The uncle had risen during  her last words and now he gave her such a look that she retreated a  few steps. Stretching out his arm in a commanding gesture, he said to  her: \"Away with you! Begone! Stay wherever you came from and don't  venture soon again into my sight!\"    Deta did not have to be told twice. She said \"Good-bye\" to Heidi and  \"Farewell\" to the uncle, and started down the mountain. Like steam her  excitement seemed to drive her forward, and she ran down at a  tremendous rate. The people in the village called to her now more than  they had on her way up, because they all were wondering where she had  left the child. They were well acquainted with both and knew their  history. When she heard from door and windows: \"Where is the child?\"  \"Where have you left her, Deta?\" and so forth, she answered more and  more reluctantly: \"Up with the Alm-Uncle,--with the Alm-Uncle!\" She  became much provoked because the women called to her from every side:  \"How could you do it?\" \"The poor little creature!\" \"The idea of  leaving such a helpless child up there!\" and, over and over again:  \"The poor little dear!\" Deta ran as quickly as she could and was glad  when she heard no more calls, because, to tell the truth, she herself  was uneasy. Her mother had asked her on her deathbed to care for  Heidi. But"]]]
