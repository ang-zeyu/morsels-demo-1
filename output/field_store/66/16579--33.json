Guayaquil.--First and Last Impressions.--Climate.--Commerce.--The       Malecon.--Glimpse of the Andes.--Scenes on the       Guayas.--Bodegas.--Mounted for Quito.--La Mona.--A Tropical Forest.      Late in the evening of the 19th of July, 1867, the steamer \"Favorita\"  dropped anchor in front of the city of Guayaquil. The first view  awakened visions of Oriental splendor. Before us was the Malecon,  stretching along the river, two miles in length--at once the most  beautiful and the most busy street in the emporium of Ecuador. In the  centre rose the Government House, with its quaint old tower, bearing  aloft the city clock. On either hand were long rows of massive,  apparently marble, three-storied buildings, each occupying an entire  square, and as elegant as they were massive. Each story was blessed with  a balcony, the upper one hung with canvas curtains now rolled up, the  other protruding over the sidewalk to form a lengthened arcade like that  of the Rue de Rivoli in imperial Paris. In this lower story were the gay  shops of Guayaquil, filled with the prints, and silks, and fancy  articles of England and France. As this is the promenade street as well  as the Broadway of commerce, crowds of Ecuadorians, who never do  business in the evening, leisurely paced the magnificent arcade; hatless  ladies sparkling with fire-flies[4] instead of diamonds, and far more  brilliant than koh-i-noors, swept the pavement with their long trains;  martial music floated on the gentle breeze from the barracks or some  festive hall, and a thousand gas-lights along the levee and in the city,  doubling their number by reflection from the river, betokened wealth and  civilization.    [Footnote 4: The _Pyrophorus noctilucus_, or \"cucujo,\" found also in  Mexico and the West Indies. It resembles our large spring-beetle. The  light proceeds from two eye-like spots on the thorax and from the  segments underneath. It feeds on the sugar-cane. On the Upper Amazon we  found the _P. clarus_, _P. pellucens_, and _P. tuberculatus_.  At Bahia, on the opposite coast, Darwin found _P. luminosus_, the most common  luminous insect.]    We landed in the morning to find our vision a dissolving view in the  light of the rising sun. The princely mansions turned out to be hollow  squares of wood-work, plastered within and without, and roofed with red  tiles. Even the \"squares\" were only distant approximations; not a right  angle could we find in our hotel. All the edifices are built (very  properly in this climate) to admit air instead of excluding it, and the  architects have wonderfully succeeded; but with the air is wafted many  an odor not so pleasing as the spicy breezes from Ceylon's isle. The  cathedral is of elegant design. Its photograph is more imposing than  Notre Dame, and a Latin inscription tells us that it is the Gate of  Heaven. But a near approach reveals a shabby structure, and the pewless  interior is made hideous by paintings and images which certainly must be  caricatures. A few genuine works of art imported from Italy alone  relieve the mind of the visitor. Excepting a few houses on the Malecon,  and not excepting the cathedral, the majority of the buildings have a  tumble-down appearance, which is not altogether due to the frequent  earthquakes which have troubled this city; while the habitations in the  outskirts are exceedingly primitive, floored and walled with split cane  and thatched with leaves, the first story occupied by domestic animals  and the second by their owners. The city is quite regularly laid out,  the main streets running parallel to the river. A few streets are  rudely paved, many are shockingly filthy, and all of them yield grass to  the delight of stray donkeys and goats. A number of mule-carts, half a  dozen carriages, one omnibus, and a hand-car on the Malecon, sum up the  wheeled vehicles of Guayaquil. The population is twenty-two thousand,  the same for thirty years past. Of these, about twenty are from the  United States, and perhaps twenty-five can command $100,000. No  foreigner has had reason to complain that Guayaquilians lacked the  virtues of politeness and hospitality. The ladies dress in excellent  taste, and are proverbial for their beauty. Spanish, Indian, and Negro  blood mingle in the lower classes. The city supports two small papers,  _Los Andes_ and _La Patria_, but they are usually issued about ten days  behind date. The hourly cry of the night-watchman is quite as musical as  that of the muezzin in Constantinople. At eleven o'clock, for example,  they sing \"_Ave Maria purissima! los once han dedo, noche clara y  serena. Viva la Patria!_\"    [Illustration: Cathedral of Guayaquil.]    The full name of the city is Santiago de Guayaquil.[5] It is so called,  first, because the conquest of the province was finished on the 25th of  July (the day of St. James), 1533; and, secondly, after Guayas, a  feudatory cacique of Atahuallpa. It was created a city by Charles V.,  October 6, 1535. It has suffered much in its subsequent history by fires  and earthquakes, pirates and pestilence. It is situated on the right  bank of the River Guayas, sixty miles from the ocean, and but a few feet  above its level. Though the most western city in South America, it is  only two degrees west of the longitude of Washington, and it is the same  distance below the equator--Orion sailing directly overhead, and the  Southern Cross taking the place of the Great Dipper. The mean annual  temperature, according to our observations, is 83 deg.. There are two  seasons, the wet, or _invierno_, and the dry, or _verano_. The _verano_  is called the summer, although astronomically it is winter; it begins in  June and terminates in November.[6] The heavy rains come on about  Christmas. March is the rainiest month in the year, and July the  coldest. It is at the close of the _invierno_ (May) that fevers most  abound. The climate of Guayaquil during the dry season is nearly  perfect. At daybreak there is a cool easterly breeze; at sunrise a brief  lull, and then a gentle variable wind; at 3 P.M. a southwest wind, at  first in gusts, then in a sustained current; at sunset the same softened  down to a gentle breeze, increasing about _7_ P.M., and dying away about  3 A.M. Notwithstanding heaps of filth and green-mantled pools,  sufficient to start a pestilence if transported to New York, the city  is usually healthy, due in great part, no doubt, to countless flocks of  buzzards which greedily wait upon decay. These carrion-hawks enjoy the  protection of law, a heavy fine being imposed for wantonly killing  one.[7] It is during the rainy season that this port earns the  reputation of being one of the most pestiferous spots on the globe. The  air is then hot and oppressive, reminding the geologist of the steaming  atmosphere in the carboniferous period; the surrounding plains are  flooded with water, and the roads, even some of the streets of the city,  become impassable; intolerable musquitoes, huge cockroaches, disgusting  centipedes, venomous scorpions, and still more deadly serpents, keep the  human species circumspect, and fevers and dysenteries do the work of  death.    [Footnote 5: The ancient name was _Culenta_.]    [Footnote 6: The continuity of the dry season is broken by a rainy fit  commencing a few days after the autumnal equinox, and called _el  Cordonazo de San Francisco_. \"Throughout South America (observes Mr.  Spruce) the periodical alternations of dry and rainy weather are laid to  the account of those saints whose 'days' coincide nearly with the epochs  of change. But if the weather be rainy when it ought to be fair, or if  the rains of winter be heavier than ordinary, the blame is invariably  laid on the moon.\"]    [Footnote 7: The turkey-buzzard, the \"John Crow\" of the West Indies, is  not a social bird, though a score are often seen together: each comes  and goes by himself.]    The Guayas is the largest river on the Pacific coast; and Guayaquil  monopolizes the commerce of Ecuador, for it is the only port. Esmeraldas  and Peylon are not to be mentioned. Through its custom-house passes  nearly every import and export. The green banks of the Guayas, covered  with an exuberant growth, are in strong contrast with the sterile coast  of Peru, and the possession of Guayaquil has been a coveted prize since  the days of Pizarro. Few spots between the tropics can vie with this  lowland in richness and vigor of vegetation. Immense quantities of  cacao--second only to that of Caracas--are produced, though but a  fraction is gathered, owing to the scarcity of laborers, so many  Ecuadorians have been exiled or killed in senseless revolutions. Twenty  million pounds are annually exported, chiefly to Spain; and two million  pounds of excellent coffee, which often finds its way into New York  under the name of \"pure Java.\" There are three or four kinds of  indigenous cacao on this coast, all richly deserving the generic title  _Theobroma_, or \"food for the gods.\" The best grows in Esmeraldas, as it  contains the largest amount of oil and has the most pleasant flavor. But  very little of it is exported, because it rots in about six months. The  _cacao de arriba_, from up the River Guayas, is the best to export, as  it keeps two years without damage.

(#3)"],[1,"gave up all thoughts  of recovery, but submitted with the utmost cheerfulness, and the most  perfect complacency and resignation. Upon his return to Edinburgh,  though he found himself much weaker, yet his cheerfulness never abated,  and he continued to divert himself, as usual, with correcting his own  works for a new edition, with reading books of amusement, with the  conversation of his friends; and, sometimes in the evening, with a party  at his favorite game of whist. His cheerfulness was so great, and his  conversation and amusements ran so much in their usual strain, that,  notwithstanding all bad symptoms, many people could not believe he was  dying. \"I shall tell your friend, Colonel Edmonstone,\" said Dr. Dundas,  to him one day, \"that I left you much better, and in a fair way of  recovery.\" \"Doctor,\" said he, \"as I believe you would not choose to tell  any thing but the truth, you had better tell him that I am dying as fast  as my enemies, if I have any, could wish, and as easily and cheerfully  as my best friends could desire.\" Colonel Edmonstone soon afterwards  came to see him, and take leave of him; and on his way home he could not  forbear writing him a letter, bidding him once more an eternal adieu,  and applying to him, as to a dying man, the beautiful French verses in  which the abbe Chaulieu in expectation of his own death, laments his  approaching separation from his friend the marquis de la Fare. Mr.  Hume's magnanimity and firmness were such, that his most affectionate  friends knew that they hazarded nothing in talking or writing to him as  to a dying man, and that so far from being hurt by this frankness, he  was rather pleased and flattered by it. I happened to come into his room  while he was reading this letter, which he had just received, and which  he immediately showed me. I told him, that though I was sensible how  very much he was weakened, and that appearances were in many respects  very bad, yet his cheerfulness was still so great, the spirit of  life seemed still to be so very strong in him, that I could not help  entertaining some faint hopes. He answered, \"Your hopes are groundless.  An habitual diarrhoea of more than a year's standing, would be a very  bad disease at any age; at my age it is a mortal one. When I lie down in  the evening, I feel myself weaker than when I rose in the morning; and  when I rise in the morning, weaker than when I lay down in the evening.  I am sensible besides, that some of my vital parts are affected, so that  I must soon die.\" \"Well,\" said I, \"if it must be so, you have at least  the satisfaction of leaving all your friends, your brother's family in  particular, in great prosperity.\" He said that he felt that satisfaction  so sensibly, that when he was reading, a few days before, Lucian's  Dialogues of the Dead, among all the excuses which are alleged to Charon  for not entering readily into his boat, he could not find one that  fitted him: he had no house to finish, he had no daughter to provide for  he had no enemies upon whom he wished to revenge himself. \"I could not  well imagine,\" said he, \"what excuse I could make to Charon in order to  obtain a little delay. I have done every thing of consequence which I  ever meant to do; and I could at no time expect to leave my relations  and friends in a better situation than that in which I am now likely  to leave them: I, therefore, have all reason to die contented.\" He  then diverted himself with inventing several jocular excuses, which  he supposed he might make to Charon, and with imagining the very surly  answers which it might suit the character of Charon to return to them.  \"Upon further consideration,\" said he, \"I thought I might say to him,  'Good Charon, I have been correcting my works for a new edition.  Allow me a little time, that I may see how the public receives the  alterations.' But Charon would answer, 'When you have seen the effect of  these, you will be for making other alterations. There will be no end of  such excuses; so, honest friend, please step into the boat.' But I  might still urge, 'Have a little patience, good Charon: I have been  endeavoring to open the eyes of the public. If I live a few years  longer, I may have the satisfaction of seeing the downfall of some of  the prevailing systems of superstition.' But Charon would then lose all  temper and decency. 'You loitering rogue, that will not happen these  many hundred years. Do you fancy I will grant you a lease for so long a  term? Get into the boat this instant, you lazy, loitering rogue.'\"    But, though Mr. Hume always talked of his approaching dissolution  with great cheerfulness, he never affected to make any parade of his  magnanimity. He never mentioned the subject but when the conversation  naturally led to it, and never dwelt longer upon it than the course  of the conversation happened to require; it was a subject indeed which  occurred pretty frequently, in consequence of the inquiries which his  friends, who came to see him, naturally made concerning the state of his  health. The conversation which I mentioned above, and which passed on  Thursday the eighth of August, was the last, except one, that I ever had  with him. He had now become so very weak, that the company of his most  intimate friends fatigued him; for his cheerfulness was still so great,  his complaisance and social disposition were still so entire, that  when any friend was with him, he could not help talking more, and with  greater exertion, than suited the weakness of his body. At his own  desire, therefore, I agreed to leave Edinburgh, where I was staying  partly upon his account and returned to my mother's house here at  Kirkaldy, upon condition that he would send for me whenever he wished  to see me; the physician who saw him most frequently, Dr. Black,  undertaking, in the mean time, to write me occasionally an account of  the state of his health.    On the twenty-second of August, the doctor wrote me the following  letter;--    \"Since my last, Mr. Hume has passed his time pretty easily, but is much  weaker. He sits up, goes down stairs once a day, and amuses himself with  reading, but seldom sees any body. He finds that even the conversation  of his most intimate friends fatigues and oppresses him; and it is happy  that he does not need it, for he is quite free from anxiety, impatience,  or low spirits, and passes his time very well with the assistance of  amusing books.\"      I received, the day after, a letter from Mr. Hume himself, of which the  following is an extract:--         \"Edinburgh, 23d August, 1776.         \"MY DEAREST FRIEND,         \"I am obliged to make use of my nephew's hand       in writing to you, as I do not rise to-day.         \"I go very fast to decline, and last night had a       small fever, which I hoped might put a quicker period       to this tedious illness; but unluckily it has, in a       great measure, gone off. I cannot submit to your       coming over here on my account, as it is possible for       me to see you so small a part of the day; but Dr.       Black can better inform you concerning the degree of       strength which may from time to time remain with       me. Adieu, etc.\"    Three days after, I received the following letter from Dr. Black:--         \"Edinburgh, Monday, 26th August, 1776.         \"DEAR SIR,         \"Yesterday, about four o'clock, afternoon, Mr. Hume expired.       The near approach of his death became evident in the night       between Thursday and Friday, when his disease became       excessive, and soon weakened him so much, that he could no       longer rise out of his bed He continued to the last       perfectly sensible, and free from much pain or feelings of       distress. He never dropped the smallest expression of       impatience; but when he had occasion to speak to the people       about him, always did it with affection and tenderness. I       thought it improper to write to bring you over, especially       as I heard that he had dictated a letter to you, desiring       you not to come. When he became very weak, it cost him an       effort to speak; and he died in such a happy composure of       mind, that nothing could exceed it.\"    Thus died our most excellent and never to be forgotten friend;  concerning whose philosophical opinions men will, no doubt, judge  variously, every one approving or condemning them, according as they  happen to coincide or disagree with his own; but concerning whose  character and conduct there can scarce be a difference of opinion. His  temper, indeed, seemed to be more happily balanced, if I may be allowed  such an expression, than that perhaps of any other man I have ever  known. Even in the lowest state of his fortune, his great and necessary  frugality never hindered him from exercising, upon proper occasions,  acts both of charity and generosity. It was a frugality founded not upon  avarice, but upon the love of independency. The extreme gentleness  of his nature never weakened either the firmness of his mind or the  steadiness of his resolutions. His constant pleasantry was the genuine  effusion of good nature and good humor, tempered with delicacy and  modesty, and without even the slightest tincture of malignity, so  frequently the disagreeable source of what is called wit in other men.  It never was the meaning of his raillery to mortify; and therefore, far  from offending, it seldom failed to please and delight, even those who  were the objects of it. To his friends who were frequently the objects  of it, there was not perhaps any one of all his great and amiable  qualities which contributed more to endear his conversation. And  that gayety of temper, so agreeable in society, but which is so often  accompanied with frivolous and superficial qualities, was in him  certainly attended with the most severe application, the most extensive  learning, the greatest depth of thought, and a capacity in every respect  the"]]]
