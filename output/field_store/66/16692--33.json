There are one or two other collections in print which are obviously  compilations, showing no original research. Of these I make no note.      SHANTY FORMS    Shanties may be roughly divided, as regards their use, into two  classes: (_a_) Hauling shanties, and (_b_) Windlass and Capstan. The  former class accompanied the setting of the sails, and the latter the  weighing of the anchor, or 'warping her in' to the wharf, etc. Capstan  shanties were also used for pumping ship. A few shanties were  'interchangeable,' i.e. they were used for both halliards and capstan.  The subdivisions of each class are interesting, and the nature of the  work involving 'walk away,' 'stamp and go,' 'sweating her up,' 'hand  over hand,' and other types of shanty would make good reading; but  nautical details, however fascinating, must be economized in a musical  publication.    Capstan shanties are readily distinguishable by their music. The  operation of walking round the capstan (pushing the capstan bars in  front of them) was continuous and not intermittent. Both tune and  chorus were, as a rule, longer than those of the hauling shanty, and  there was much greater variety of rhythm. Popular songs, if they had a  chorus or refrain, could be, and were, effectively employed for  windlass and capstan work.    Hauling shanties were usually shorter than capstan ones, and are of  two types: (_a_) those used for 'the long hoist' and (_b_) those  required for 'the short pull' or 'sweating-up.' Americans called these  operations the 'long' and the 'short drag.' The former was used when  beginning to hoist sails, when the gear would naturally be slack and  moderately easy to manipulate. It had two short choruses, with a  double pull in each. In the following example, the pulls are marked  [music accent symbol].    [Music illustration: REUBEN RANZO         SOLO. Oh pity poor Reuben Ranzo,       CHORUS. [accent] Ranzo, boys, [accent] Ranzo,       SOLO. Oh poor old Reuben Ranzo,       CHORUS. [accent] Ranzo, boys, [accent] Ranzo.]    It is easy to see how effective a collective pull at each of these  points would be, while the short intervals of solo would give time for  shifting the hands on the rope and making ready for the next combined  effort.    When the sail was fully hoisted and the gear taut, a much stronger  pull was necessary in order to make everything fast, so the shanty was  then changed for a 'sweating-up' one, in which there was only one  short chorus and one very strong pull:    [Music illustration: HAUL THE BOWLIN'         SOLO: We'll haul the bowlin', so early in the morning,       CHORUS: We'll haul the bowlin', the bowlin' [accent] haul.]    So much effort was now required on the pull that it was difficult to  sing a musical note at that point. The last word was therefore usually  shouted.      SOURCES OF TUNES    The sailor travelled in many lands, and in his shanties there are  distinct traces of the nationalities of the countries he visited.  Without doubt a number of them came from American negro sources. The  songs heard on Venetian gondolas must have had their effect, as many  examples show. There are also distinct traces of folk-songs which the  sailor would have learnt ashore in his native fishing village, and the  more familiar Christy Minstrel song was frequently pressed into the  service. As an old sailor once said to me: 'You can make anything into  a shanty.'    Like all traditional tunes, some shanties are in the ancient modes,  and others in the modern major and minor keys. It is the habit of the  'folk-songer' (I am not alluding to our recognized folk-song experts)  to find 'modes' in every traditional tune. It will suffice, therefore,  to say that shanties follow the course of all other traditional music.  Many are modern, and easily recognizable as such. Others are modal in  character, such as 'What shall we do with the drunken sailor?' No. 14,  and 'The Hog's-Eye Man,' No. 11. Others fulfil to a certain extent  modal conditions, but are nevertheless in keys, e.g. 'Stormalong  John,' No. 10.    Like many other folk-songs, certain shanties--originally, no doubt, in  a mode--were, by the insertion of leading notes, converted into the  minor key. There was also the tendency on the part of the modern  sailor to turn his minor key into a major one. I sometimes find  sailors singing in the major, nowadays, tunes which the very old men  of my boyhood used to sing in the minor. A case in point is 'Haul  away, Joe,' No. 28. Miss Smith is correct in giving it in the minor  form which once obtained on the Tyne, and I am inclined to hazard the  opinion that that was the original form and not, as now, the  following:    [Music illustration:         Way, haul away,       We'll haul away the bowlin'.       Way, haul away,       We'll haul away, Joe.]    In later times I have also heard 'The Drunken Sailor' (a distinctly  modal tune) sung in the major as follows:    [Music illustration:         What shall we do with the drunken sailor?       What shall we do with the drunken sailor? etc.]    I have generally found that these perversions of the tunes are due to  sailors who took to the sea as young men in the last days of the  sailing ship, and consequently did not imbibe to the full the old  traditions. With the intolerance of youth they assumed that the modal  turn given to a shanty by the older sailor was the mark of ignorance,  since it did not square with their ideas of a major or minor key. This  experience is common to all folk-tune collectors.    Other characteristics, for example: (_a_) different words to the same  melody; (_b_) different melodies to the same or similar words, need  not be enlarged upon here, as they will be self-evident when a  definitive collection is published.    Of the usual troubles incidental to folk-song collecting it is  unnecessary to speak. But the collection of shanties involves  difficulties of a special kind. In taking down a folk-song from a  rustic, one's chief difficulty is surmounted when one has broken down  his shyness and induced him to sing. There is nothing for him to do  then but get on with the song. Shanties, however, being labour songs,  one is 'up against' the strong psychological connection between the  song and its manual acts. Two illustrations will explain what I mean.    A friend of mine who lives in Kerry wished a collector to hear some of  the traditional keening, and an old woman with the reputation of being  the best keener in the district, when brought to the house to sing the  funeral chants, made several attempts and then replied in a distressed  manner: 'I can't do it; there's no body,' This did not mean that she  was unwilling to keen in the absence of a corpse, but that she was  unable to do so. Just before giving up in despair my friend was seized  with a brain wave, and asked her if it would suffice for him to lie  down on the floor and personate the corpse. When he had done this the  old woman found herself able to get on with the keening.    An incident related to me quite casually by Sir Walter Runciman throws  a similar light on the inseparability of a shanty and its labour. He  described how one evening several north country ships happened to be  lying in a certain port. All the officers and crews were ashore,  leaving only the apprentices aboard, some of whom, as he remarked,  were 'very keen on shanties,' and their suggestion of passing away the  time by singing some was received with enthusiasm. The whole party of  about thirty apprentices at once collected themselves aboard one  vessel, sheeted home the main topsail, and commenced to haul it up to  the tune of 'Boney was a warrior,' changing to 'Haul the Bowlin'' for  'sweating-up.' In the enthusiasm of their singing, and the absence of  any officer to call ''Vast hauling,' they continued operations until  they broke the topsail yard in two, when the sight of the wreckage and  the fear of consequences brought the singing to an abrupt conclusion.  In my then ignorance I naturally asked: 'Why couldn't you have sung  shanties without hoisting the topsail?' and the reply was: 'How could  we sing a shanty without having our hands on the rope?' Here we have  the whole psychology of the labour-song: the old woman could not keen  without the 'body,' and the young apprentices could not sing shanties  apart from the work to which they belonged. The only truly  satisfactory results which I ever get nowadays from an old sailor are  when he has been stimulated by conversation to become reminiscent, and  croons his shanties almost subconsciously. Whenever I find a sailor  willing to declaim shanties in the style of a song I begin to be a  little suspicious of his seamanship. In one of the journals of the  Folk-Song Society there is an account of a sailor who formed a little  party of seafaring men to give public performances of shanties on the  concert platform. No doubt this was an interesting experience for the  listeners, but that a self-conscious performance such as this could  represent the old shanty singing I find it difficult to believe. Of  course I have had sailors sing shanties to me in a fine declamatory  manner, but I usually found one of three things to be the case: the  man was a 'sea lawyer,' or had not done much deep-sea sailing; or his  seamanship only dated from the decline of the sailing vessel.    It is doubtless interesting to the folk-songer to see in print  shanties taken down from an individual sailor with his individual  melodic twirls and twiddles. But since no two sailors ever sing the  same shanty quite in the same manner, there must necessarily be some  means of getting at the tune, unhampered by these individual  idiosyncrasies, which are quite a different thing from what folk-song  students recognize as 'variants.' The power to discriminate can only  be acquired by familiarity with the shanty as it was in its palmy  days. The collector who comes upon the scene at"]]]
