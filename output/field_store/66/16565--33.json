If it was His  Will which had brought them here, then Asti's power would wrap her round  with safety. By His Will she had come out of Memphir over ways no human  of Erb had ever trod before. Could she doubt that His Protection was  with her now?    It took only a moment to make secure the webbed shoes, to pull on and  fasten the hood, to tighten the buckles of her gloves. Then she crept  forward, shuddering as the water rose about her ankles. But Lur pushed  on before her, his head disappearing fearlessly under the surface as he  crawled through the jagged opening in the ship below.    Smashed engines which had no meaning in her eyes occupied most of the  broken section of the wreck. None of the metal showed any deterioration  beyond that which had occurred at the time of the crash. Under her  exploring hands it was firm and whole.    Lur was pulling at a small door half hidden by a mass of twisted wires  and plates and, just as Varta crawled around this obstacle to join him,  the barrier gave way allowing them to squeeze through into what had once  been the living quarters of the ship.    Varta recognized seats, a table, and other bits of strictly utilitarian  furniture. But of those who had once been at home there, there remained  no trace. Lur, having given one glance to the furnishings, was prowling  about the far end of the cabin uncertainly, and now he voiced his  uneasiness.    \"There is something beyond, something which once had life--\"    Varta crowded up to him. To her eyes the wall seemed without line of an  opening, and yet Lur was running his broad front paws over it carefully,  now and then throwing his weight against the smooth surface.    \"There is no door--\" she pointed out doubtfully.    \"No door--ah--here--\" Lur unsheathed formidable fighting claws to their  full length for perhaps the first time in his temple-sheltered life, and  endeavored to work them into a small crevice. The muscles of his  forelegs and quarters stood out in sharp relief under his scales, his  fangs were bare as his lips snapped back with effort.    Something gave, a thin black line appeared to mark the edges of a door.  Then time, or Lur's strength, broke the ancient locking mechanism. The  door gave so suddenly that they were both sent hurtling backward and  Lur's breath burst from him in a huge bubble.    The sealed compartment was hardly more than a cupboard but it was full.  Spread-eagled against the wall was a four-limbed creature whose form was  so smothered in a bulky suit that Varta could only guess that it was  akin in shape to her own. Hoops of metal locked it firmly to the wall,  but the head had fallen forward so that the face plate in the helmet was  hidden.    Slowly the girl breasted the water which filled the cabin and reached  her hands toward the bowed helmet of the prisoner. Gingerly, her blunted  talons scraping across metal, she pulled it up to her eye-level.    The eyes of that which stood within the suit were closed, as if in  sleep, but there was a warm, healthy tint to the bronze skin, so  different in shade to her own pallid coloring. For the rest, the  prisoner had the two eyes, the centered nose, the properly shaped mouth  which were common to the men of Erb. Hair grew on his head, black and  thick and there was a faint shadow of beard on his jaw line.    \"This is a man--\" her thought reached Lur.    \"Why not? Did you expect a serpent? It is a pity he is dead--\"    Varta felt a rich warm tide rising in her throat to answer that teasing  half question. There were times when Lur's thought reading was annoying,  He had risen to his hind legs so that he too could look into the shell  which held their find.    \"Yes, a pity,\" he repeated. \"But--\"    A vision of the turbi flowers swept through her mind. Had Lur suggested  it, or had that wild thought been hers alone? Only this ship was so  old--so very old!    Lur's red tongue flicked. \"It can do no harm to try--\" he suggested  slyly and set his claws into the hoop holding the captive's right wrist,  testing its strength.    \"But the metal on the shore, it crumpled into powder at my touch--\" she  protested. \"What if we carry him out only to have--to have--\" Her mind  shuddered away from the picture which followed.    \"Did the turbi blossom fade when pulled out?\" countered Lur. \"There is a  secret to these fastenings--\" He pulled and pried impatiently.    Varta tried to help but even their united strength was useless against  the force which held the loops in place. Breathless the girl slumped  back against the wall of the cabin while Lur settled down on his  haunches. One of the odd patches of color drifted by, its vivid scarlet  like a jewel spiraling lazily upward. Varta's eyes followed its drift  and so were guided to what she had forgotten, the worlds of Asti.    \"Asti!\"    Lur was looking up too.    \"The power of Asti!\"    Varta's hand went up, rested for a long moment under the sun and then  drew it down, carefully, slowly, as she had in Memphir's temple. Then  she stepped towards the captive. Within her hood a beaded line of  moisture outlined her lips, a pulse thundered on her temple. This was a  fearsome thing to try.    She held the sun on a line with one of the wrist bonds, She must avoid  the flesh it imprisoned, for Asti's power could kill.    From the sun there shot an orange-red beam to strike full upon the  metal. A thin line of red crept across the smooth hoop, crept and  widened. Varta raised her hand, sending the sun spinning up and Lur's  claws pulled on the metal. It broke like rotten wood in his grasp.    The girl gave a little gasp of half-terrified delight. Then the old  legends were true! As Asti's priestess she controlled powers too great  to guess. Swiftly she loosed the other hoops and restored the sun and  worlds to their place over her head as the captive slumped across the  threshold of his cell.    Tugging and straining they brought him out of the broken ship into the  sunlight of Erb. Varta threw back her hood and breathed deeply of the  air which was not manufactured by the wizardry of the lizard skin and  Lur sat panting, his nostril flaps open. It was he who spied the spring  on the mountain side above, a spring of water uncontaminated by the  strange life of the lake. They both dragged themselves there to drink  deeply.    Varta returned to the lake shore reluctantly. Within her heart she  believed that the man they had brought from the ship was truly dead. Lur  might hold out the promise of the flowers, but this was a man and he had  lain in the water for countless ages--    So she went with lagging steps, to find Lur busy. He had solved the  mystery of the space suit and had stripped it from the unknown. Now his  clawed paw rested lightly on the bared chest and he turned to Varta  eagerly.    \"There is life--\"    Hardly daring to believe that, she dropped down beside Lur and touched  their prize. Lur was right, the flesh was warm and she had caught the  faint rhythm of shallow breath. Half remembering old tales, she put her  hands on the arch of the lower ribs and began to aid that rhythm. The  breaths were deeper--    Then the man half turned, his arm moved. Varta and Lur drew back. For  the first time the girl probed gently the sleeping mind before her--even  as she had read the minds of those few of Memphir who had ascended to  the temple precincts in the last days.    Much of what she read now was confused or so alien to Erb that it had no  meaning for her. But she saw a great city plunged into flaming death in  an instant and felt the horror and remorse of the man at her feet  because of his own part in that act, the horror and remorse which had  led him to open rebellion and so to his imprisonment. There was a last  dark and frightening memory of a door closing on light and hope--    The space man moaned softly and hunched his shoulders as if he struggled  vainly to tear loose from bonds.    \"He thinks that he is still prisoner,\" observed Lur. \"For him life  begins at the very point it ended--even as it did for the turbi flowers.  See--now he awakens.\"    The eyelids rose slowly, as if the man hated to see what he must look  upon. Then, as he sighted Varta and Lur, his eyes went wide. He pulled  himself up and looked dazedly around, striking out wildly with his  fists. Catching sight of the clumsy suit Lur had taken from him he  pulled at it, looking at the two before him as if he feared some attack.    Varta turned to Lur for help. She might read minds and use the wordless  speech of Lur. But his people knew the art of such communication long  before the first priest of Asti had stumbled upon their secret. Let Lur  now quiet this outlander.    Delicately Lur sought a way into the other's mind, twisting down paths  of thought strange to him. Even Varta could not follow the subtile waves  sent forth in the quick examination and reconnoitering, nor could she  understand all of the conversation which resulted. For the man from the  ancient ship answered in speech aloud, sharp harsh sounds of no meaning.  It was only after repeated instruction from Lur that he began to frame  his messages in his mind, clumsily and disconnectedly.    Pictures of another world, another solar system, began to grow more  clear as the space man became more at home in the new way of  communication. He was one of a race who had come to Erb from beyond the  stars and discovered it a world without human life: So they had  established colonies and built great cities--far different from  Memphir--and had lived in peace for centuries of their own time.    Then on the faraway planet of their birth there had begun a great war, a  war which brought flaming death to all that world. The survivors of a  last battle in outer space had fled to the colonies on Erb. But among  this handful were men driven mad by the death of their world, and these  had blasted the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19031"],[0,"A Treatise on Adulterations of Food, and Culinary Poisons (#3)"],[1,"fellow subject of a few shillings on the high-way, is  sentenced to death; while he who distributes a slow poison to a whole  community, escapes unpunished.    It has been urged by some, that, under so vast a system of finance as  that of Great Britain, it is expedient that the revenue should be  collected in large amounts; and therefore that the severity of the law  should be relaxed in favour of all mercantile concerns in proportion to  their extent: encouragement must be given to large capitalists; and  where an extensive brewery or distillery yields an important  contribution to the revenue, no strict scrutiny need be adopted in  regard to the quality of the article from which such contribution is  raised, provided the excise do not suffer by the fraud.    But the principles of the constitution afford no sanction to this  preference, and the true interests of the country require that it should  be abolished; for a tax dependent upon deception must be at best  precarious, and must be, sooner or later, diminished by the irresistible  diffusion of knowledge. Sound policy requires that the law should be  impartially enforced in all cases; and if its penalties were extended to  abuses of which it does not now take cognisance, there is no doubt that  the revenue would be abundantly benefited.    Another species of fraud, to which I shall at present but briefly  advert, and which has increased to so alarming an extent, that it loudly  calls for the interference of government, is the adulteration of drugs  and medicines.    Nine-tenths of the most potent drugs and chemical preparations used in  pharmacy, are vended in a sophisticated state by dealers who would be  the last to be suspected. It is well known, that of the article Peruvian  bark, there is a variety of species inferior to the genuine; that too  little discrimination is exercised by the collectors of this precious  medicament; that it is carelessly assorted, and is frequently packed in  green hides; that much of it arrives in Spain in a half-decayed state,  mixed with fragments of other vegetables and various extraneous  substances; and in this state is distributed throughout Europe.    But as if this were not a sufficient deterioration, the public are often  served with a spurious compound of mahogany saw-dust and oak wood,  ground into powder mixed with a proportion of good quinquina, and sold  as genuine bark powder.    Every chemist knows that there are mills constantly at work in this  metropolis, which furnish bark powder at a much cheaper rate than the  substance can be procured for in its natural state. The price of the  best genuine bark, upon an average, is not lower than twelve shillings  the pound; but immense quantities of powder bark are supplied to the  apothecaries at three or four shillings a pound.    It is also notorious that there are manufacturers of spurious rhubarb  powder, ipecacuanha powder,[2] James's powder; and other simple and  compound medicines of great potency, who carry on their diabolical trade  on an amazingly large scale. Indeed, the quantity of medical  preparations thus sophisticated exceeds belief. Cheapness, and not  genuineness and excellence, is the grand desideratum with the  unprincipled dealers in drugs and medicines.    Those who are familiar with chemistry may easily convince themselves of  the existence of the fraud, by subjecting to a chemical examination  either spirits of hartshorn, magnesia, calcined magnesia, calomel, or  any other chemical preparation in general demand.    Spirit of hartshorn is counterfeited by mixing liquid caustic ammonia  with the distilled spirit of hartshorn, to increase the pungency of its  odour, and to enable it to bear an addition of water.    The fraud is detected by adding spirit of wine to the sophisticated  spirit; for, if no considerable coagulation ensues, the adulteration is  proved. It may also be discovered by the hartshorn spirit not producing  a brisk effervescence when mixed with muriatic or nitric acid.    Magnesia usually contains a portion of lime, originating from hard water  being used instead of soft, in the preparation of this medicine.    To ascertain the purity of magnesia, add to a portion of it a little  sulphuric acid, diluted with ten times its bulk of water. If the  magnesia be completely soluble, and the solution remains transparent, it  may be pronounced _pure_; but not otherwise. Or, dissolve a portion of  the magnesia in muriatic acid, and add a solution of sub-carbonate of  ammonia. If any lime be present, it will form a precipitate; whereas  pure magnesia will remain in solution.    Calcined magnesia is seldom met with in a pure state. It may be assayed  by the same tests as the common magnesia. It ought not to effervesce at  all, with dilute sulphuric acid; and, if the magnesia and acid be put  together into one scale of a balance, no diminution of weight should  ensue on mixing them together. Calcined magnesia, however, is very  seldom so pure as to be totally dissolved by diluted sulphuric acid;  for a small insoluble residue generally remains, consisting chiefly of  silicious earth, derived from the alkali employed in the preparation of  it. The solution in sulphuric acid, when largely diluted, ought not to  afford any precipitation by the addition of oxalate of ammonia.    The genuineness of calomel may be ascertained by boiling, for a few  minutes, one part, with 1/32 part of muriate of ammonia in ten parts of  distilled water. When carbonate of potash is added to the filtered  solution, no precipitation will ensue if the calomel be pure.    Indeed, some of the most common and cheap drugs do not escape the  adulterating hand of the unprincipled druggist. Syrup of buckthorn, for  example, instead of being prepared from the juice of buckthorn berries,  (_rhamnus catharticus_,) is made from the fruit of the blackberry  bearing alder, and the dogberry tree. A mixture of the berries of the  buckthorn and blackberry bearing alder, and of the dogberry tree, may be  seen publicly exposed for sale by some of the venders of medicinal  herbs. This abuse may be discovered by opening the berries: those of  buckthorn have almost always four seeds; of the alder, two; and of the  dogberry, only one. Buckthorn berries, bruised on white paper, stain it  of a green colour, which the others do not.    Instead of worm-seed (_artemisia santonica_,) the seeds of tansy are  frequently offered for sale, or a mixture of both.    A great many of the essential oils obtained from the more expensive  spices, are frequently so much adulterated, that it is not easy to meet  with such as are at all fit for use: nor are these adulterations easily  discoverable. The grosser abuses, indeed, may be readily detected. Thus,  if the oil be adulterated with alcohol, it will turn milky on the  addition of water; if with expressed oils, alcohol will dissolve the  volatile, and leave the other behind; if with oil of turpentine, on  dipping a piece of paper in the mixture, and drying it with a gentle  heat, the turpentine will be betrayed by its smell. The more subtile  artists, however, have contrived other methods of sophistication, which  elude all trials. And as all volatile oils agree in the general  properties of solubility in spirit of wine, and volatility in the heat  of boiling water, &c. it is plain that they may be variously mixed with  each other, or the dearer sophisticated with the cheaper, without any  possibility of discovering the abuse by any of the before-mentioned  trials. Perfumers assert that the smell and taste are the only certain  tests of which the nature of the thing will admit. For example, if a  bark should have in every respect the appearance of good cinnamon, and  should be proved indisputably to be the genuine bark of the cinnamon  tree; yet if it want the cinnamon flavour, or has it but in a low  degree, we reject it: and the case is the same with the essential oil of  cinnamon. It is only from use and habit, or comparisons with specimens  of known quality, that we can judge of the goodness, either of the drugs  themselves, or of their oils.    Most of the arrow-root, the fecula of the Maranta arudinacea, sold by  druggists, is a mixture of potatoe starch and arrow-root.    The same system of adulteration extends to articles used in various  trades and manufactures. For instance, linen tape, and various other  household commodities of that kind, instead of being manufactured of  linen thread only, are made up of linen and cotton. Colours for  painting, not only those used by artists, such as ultramarine,[3]  carmine,[4] and lake;[5] Antwerp blue,[6] chrome yellow,[7] and Indian  ink;[8] but also the coarser colours used by the common house-painter  are more or less adulterated. Thus, of the latter kind, white lead[9] is  mixed with carbonate or sulphate of barytes; vermilion[10] with red  lead.    Soap used in house-keeping is frequently adulterated with a  considerable portion of fine white clay, brought from St. Stephens, in  Cornwall. In the manufacture of printing paper, a large quantity of  plaster of Paris is added to the paper stuff, to increase the weight of  the manufactured article. The selvage of cloth is often dyed with a  permanent colour, and artfully stitched to the edge of cloth dyed with a  fugitive dye. The frauds committed in the tanning of skins, and in the  manufacture of cutlery and jewelry, exceed belief.    The object of all unprincipled modern manufacturers seems to be the  sparing of their time and labour as much as possible, and to increase  the quantity of the articles they produce, without much regard to their  quality. The ingenuity and perseverance of self-interest is proof  against prohibitions, and contrives to elude the vigilance of the most  active government.    The eager and insatiable thirst for gain, which seems to be a leading  characteristic of the times, calls into action every human faculty, and  gives "]]]
