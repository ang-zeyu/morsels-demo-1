The scenery of the delta, though flat, is luxuriant; for Mohammed Ali  not only introduced cotton into Egypt, but compelled the people to  plant trees, so that the landscape is varied by large groves of  date-palms, and the sycamores and other trees which surround the  villages and give shade to the paths and canal banks. It is a pastoral  land, luxuriantly green; and how beautiful it is as the night falls,  and the last of the sunset lingers in the dew-laden air, wreathed with  the smoke of many fires; and, as the stars one by one appear in the  darkening sky, and the labour of the field ceases, the lowing cattle  wend their slow ways toward the villages and the bull-frogs in their  thousands raise their evensong. No scenery in the world has, to my  mind, such mellow and serene beauty as these farm-lands of Lower  Egypt, and in a later chapter I will tell you more about them, and of  the simple people whose life is spent in the fields.          CHAPTER III    CAIRO--I      Usually its capital may be taken as typical of its country; but in  Egypt this is not so. Cairo is essentially different from anything  else in Egypt, not only in its buildings and architecture, but in the  type and mode of life of its inhabitants.    How shall I give you any real idea of a city which is often considered  to be the most beautiful Oriental capital in the world, as it is  certainly one of the most interesting? From a distance, looking across  the fields of Shoubra,[2] it is very beautiful, especially at sunset,  when beyond the dark green foliage of the sycamore and cypress trees  which rise above the orange groves, the domes and minarets of the  native quarter gleam golden in the sunlight. Behind is the citadel,  crowned by Mohammed Ali's tomb-mosque of white marble, whose tall twin  minarets seem to tower above the rosy-tinted heights of the Mokattam  Hills. Even here the noise of the city reaches you in a subdued hum,  for Cairo is not only a large city, but it is densely populated, and  contains nearly a twelfth part of the whole population of Egypt. Away  towards the sunset the pyramids stand out clearly against the glowing  sky, and the tall masts and sails of the Nile boats reach high above  the palm groves and buildings which screen the river from view.    [Footnote 2: A distant suburb of Cairo.]    Cairo consists of two distinct and widely different parts, the  Esbikiyeh and Ismailieh quarters of the west end, built for and almost  entirely occupied by Europeans, and the purely native town, whose  streets and bazaars, mosques and palaces, have remained practically  unchanged for centuries.    At one time the European quarters were in many ways charming, though  too much like some fashionable continental town to be altogether  picturesque; but of late years the shady avenues and gardens of the  west end have entirely disappeared to make way for streets of  commercial buildings, while the new districts of Kasr-el-Dubara and  Ghezireh have arisen to house the well-to-do. Our interest in Cairo,  therefore, is centred in the native quarters, where miles of streets  and alleys, rich in Arabesque buildings, are untouched except by the  mellowing hand of Time.    It is difficult at first to form any true idea of native Cairo; its  life is so varied and its interests so diverse that the new-comer is  bewildered.    Types of many races, clad in strange Eastern costumes, crowd the  narrow streets, which are overlooked by many beautiful buildings whose  dark shadows lend additional glory to the sunlight. Richly carved  doorways give glimpses of cool courts and gardens within the houses,  while awnings of many colours shade the bazaars and shopping streets.    [Illustration: AN ARAB CAFE, CAIRO.]    Heavily laden camels and quaint native carts with difficulty thread  their way through the crowd, amongst which little children, clad in  the gayest of dresses, play their games. Goats and sheep pick up a  living in the streets, clearing it of garbage, and often feeding more  generously, though surreptitiously, from a fruit or vegetable shop.  Hawks and pigeons wheel and circle in the air, which is filled with  the scent of incense and the sound of the street cries. Everywhere is  movement and bustle, and the glowing colour of the buildings and  costumes of every tint and texture.    Let us study a little more closely the individual types and  occupations that make up the life of the streets, and a pleasant way  in which to do so is to seat oneself on the high bench of some native  cafe, where, undisturbed by the traffic, we may watch the passers-by.    The cafes themselves play an important part in the life of the people,  being a rendezvous not only for the refreshment provided, but for  gossip and the interchange of news. They are very numerous all over  the city, and are generally fronted by three or more wooden archways  painted in some bright colour and open to the street. Outside are the  \"dekkas,\" or high benches, on which, sitting cross-legged, the  customer enjoys his coffee or his pipe. Indoors are a few chairs, and  the square tiled platform on which are placed the cooking-pots and  little charcoal fire of the cafe-keeper. Generally an awning of canvas  covered with patches of coloured cloth screens you from the sun, or  gives shelter from the occasional winter showers which clear the  streets of passengers and render them a sea of mud, for the streets  are unpaved and no drainage exists to carry off the surface water.    The cafe-owner is always polite, and glad to see you, and the coffee  he makes is nearly always excellent, though few of his European guests  would care to regale themselves with the curiously shaped water-pipes  with which the native intoxicates himself with opium or \"hashish,\"  and which are used indiscriminately by all the customers.    Like most of the small tradesmen, our host is clad in a \"gelabieh,\" or  long gown of white or blue cotton, gathered round the waist by a  girdle of coloured cloth. Stuck jauntily on the back of his head is  the red \"tarbush,\" or fez, universal in the towns, or, if married,  he wears a turban of fine white cotton; his shoes are of red or yellow  leather, but are generally carried in his hand if the streets are  muddy.    And now, having noticed our cafe and our host, let us sit comfortably  and try and distinguish the various types which go to form the crowd  which from dawn to dark throngs the thoroughfares.    First of all it will be noticed how many different trades are carried  on in the streets, most prominent of all being that of the  water-sellers, for Cairo is hot and dusty, and water is in constant  demand.    There are several grades of water-carriers. First, the \"sakka,\" who  carries on his back a goat-skin filled with water; one of the  fore-legs forms the spout, which is simply held tight in the hand to  prevent the water from escaping. He is the poorest of them all,  barefooted and wearing an often ragged blue gelabieh, while a leather  apron protects his back from the dripping goat-skin. He it is who  waters the streets and fills the \"zirs,\" or filters, in the shops,  a number of shop-keepers combining to employ him to render this  service to their section of a street.    A superior grade is the \"khamali,\" who carries upon his back a large  earthen pot of filtered water. When he wishes to fill the brass  drinking-cups, which he cleverly tinkles as he walks, he has simply to  bend forward until the water runs out of the spout above his shoulder  and is caught in one of the cups, and it is interesting to notice that  he seldom spills a drop.    Then there is that swaggering and often handsome fellow clad in red,  and with a coloured scarf around his head, who, with shoulders well  set back, carries, slung in a broad leather belt, a terra-cotta jar.  This is the \"sussi,\" who sells liquorice water, or a beverage made  from prunes, and which he hands to his customers in a dainty blue and  white china bowl.    The highest grade of all is the \"sherbutli,\" also gaily dressed, who  from an enormous green glass bottle, brass mounted, and cooled by a  large lump of ice held in a cradle at the neck, dispenses sherbet,  lemonade, or other cooling drink. Each of these classes of  water-seller is well patronized, for Egypt is a thirsty land.    Here comes a bread-seller, whose fancy loaves and cakes are made in  rings and strung upon wands which project from the rim of a basket; or  on a tray of wicker-work or queer little donkey-cart are piled the  flat unleavened loaves of the people.    To remind us of the chief baker's dream, the pastry-cook still cries  his wares, which, carried in baskets on his head, are often raided by  the thieving hawk or crow, while delicious fruits and fresh vegetables  are vended from barrows, much like the coster trade in London.    Many of the passers-by are well to do, shop-keepers and merchants,  clothed in flowing \"khaftan\" of coloured cloth or silk, over which,  hanging loosely from their shoulders, is the black goat's wool  \"arbiyeh,\" or cloak.    The shops also make a gay addition to the general colour scheme. Of  these the fruit shop is perhaps the prettiest; here rosy apples and  juicy oranges, or pink-fleshed water-melons, are tastefully arranged  in baskets or on shelves covered with papers of different tints. Even  the tallow-chandler renders his shop attractive by means of festoons  of candles, some of enormous size, and all tinted in patterns, while  the more important shopping streets are one continuous display of many  coloured silks and cotton goods, the glittering wares of the jeweller  or coppersmith, and the gay trappings of the saddler.    In between the shops may often be noticed small doorways, whose white  plaster is decorated by some bright though crude design in many  colours; this is the \"hammam,\" or public bath, while the shop of the  barber, chief"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18674"],[0,"A Chinese Wonder Book (#3)"],[1," that we are exceptions to the rule. If you will spare me, I will  obey you for life, in fact, will be your humble slave.\" Then, with a  quick jerk, freeing itself, \"See, I am loose now, but honour holds me as  if I were tied, and so I make no further attempt to get away.\"    \"Much good it would do you,\" purred Whitehead, her fur crackling  noisily, and her mouth watering for a taste of rat steak. \"However,  I am quite willing to put you to the test. First, answer a few polite  questions and I will see if you're a truthful fellow. What kind of food  is your master eating now, that you should be so round and plump when  I am thin and scrawny?\"    \"Oh, we have been in luck lately, I can tell you. Master and mistress  feed on the fat of the land, and of course we hangers-on get the  crumbs.\"    \"But this is a poor tumble-down house. How can they afford such eating?\"    \"That is a great secret, but as I am in honour bound to tell you, here  goes. My mistress has just obtained in some manner or other, a fairy's  charm----\"    \"She stole it from our place,\" hissed the cat, \"I will claw her eyes out  if I get the chance. Why, we've been fairly starving for want of that  beetle. She stole it from us just after she had been an invited guest!  What do you think of that for honour, Sir Rat? Were your mistress's  ancestors followers of the sage?\"    \"Oh, oh, oh! Why, that explains everything!\" wailed the rat. \"I have  often wondered how they got the golden beetle, and yet of course I dared  not ask any questions.\"    \"No, certainly not! But hark you, friend rat--you get that golden  trinket back for me, and I will set you free at once of all obligations.  Do you know where she hides it?\"    \"Yes, in a crevice where the wall is broken. I will bring it to you in  a jiffy, but how shall we exist when our charm is gone? There will be  a season of scanty food, I fear; beggars' fare for all of us.\"    \"Live on the memory of your good deed,\" purred the cat. \"It is splendid,  you know, to be an honest beggar. Now scoot! I trust you completely,  since your people lived in the home of Confucius. I will wait here for  your return. Ah!\" laughed Whitehead to herself, \"luck seems to be coming  our way again!\"    Five minutes later the rat appeared, bearing the trinket in its mouth.  It passed the beetle over to the cat, and then with a whisk was off for  ever. Its honour was safe, but it was afraid of Whitehead. It had seen  the gleam of desire in her green eyes, and the cat might have broken her  word if she had not been so anxious to get back home where her mistress  could command the wonderful kettle once more to bring forth food.    The two adventurers reached the river just as the sun was rising above  the eastern hills.    \"Be careful,\" cautioned Blackfoot, as the cat leaped upon his back for  her ride across the stream, \"be careful not to forget the treasure. In  short, remember that even though you are a female, it is necessary to  keep your mouth closed till we reach the other side.\"    \"Thanks, but I don't think I need your advice,\" replied Whitehead,  picking up the beetle and leaping on to the dog's back.    But alas! just as they were nearing the farther shore, the excited cat  forgot her wisdom for a moment. A fish suddenly leaped out of the water  directly under her nose. It was too great a temptation. Snap! went her  jaws in a vain effort to land the scaly treasure, and the golden beetle  sank to the bottom of the river.    \"There!\" said the dog angrily, \"what did I tell you? Now all our trouble  has been in vain--all on account of your stupidity.\"    For a time there was a bitter dispute, and the companions called each  other some very bad names--such as turtle and rabbit. Just as they were  starting away from the river, disappointed and discouraged, a friendly  frog who had by chance heard their conversation offered to fetch the  treasure from the bottom of the stream. No sooner said than done, and  after thanking this accommodating animal profusely, they turned homeward  once more.    When they reached the cottage the door was shut, and, bark as he would,  Blackfoot could not persuade his master to open it. There was the sound  of loud wailing inside.    \"Mistress is broken-hearted,\" whispered the cat, \"I will go to her and  make her happy.\"    So saying, she sprang lightly through a hole in the paper window, which,  alas! was too small and too far from the ground for the faithful dog to  enter.    A sad sight greeted the gaze of Whitehead. The son was lying on the bed  unconscious, almost dead for want of food, while his mother, in despair,  was rocking backwards and forwards wringing her wrinkled hands and  crying at the top of her voice for some one to come and save them.    \"Here I am, mistress,\" cried Whitehead, \"and here is the treasure you  are weeping for. I have rescued it and brought it back to you.\"    The widow, wild with joy at sight of the beetle, seized the cat in her  scrawny arms and hugged the pet tightly to her bosom.    \"Breakfast, son, breakfast! Wake up from your swoon! Fortune has come  again. We are saved from starvation!\"    Soon a steaming hot meal was ready, and you may well imagine how the old  woman and her son, heaping praises upon Whitehead, filled the beast's  platter with good things, but never a word did they say of the faithful  dog, who remained outside sniffing the fragrant odours and waiting in  sad wonder, for all this time the artful cat had said nothing of  Blackfoot's part in the rescue of the golden beetle.    At last, when breakfast was over, slipping away from the others,  Whitehead jumped out through the hole in the window.    \"Oh, my dear Blackfoot,\" she began laughingly, \"you should have been  inside to see what a feast they gave me! Mistress was so delighted at  my bringing back her treasure that she could not give me enough to eat,  nor say enough kind things about me. Too bad, old fellow, that you are  hungry. You'd better run out into the street and hunt up a bone.\"    Maddened by the shameful treachery of his companion, the enraged dog  sprang upon the cat and in a few seconds had shaken her to death.    \"So dies the one who forgets a friend and who loses honour,\" he cried  sadly, as he stood over the body of his companion.    Rushing out into the street, he proclaimed the treachery of Whitehead  to the members of his tribe, at the same time advising that all  self-respecting dogs should from that time onwards make war upon the  feline race.    And that is why the descendants of old Blackfoot, whether in China or  in the great countries of the West, have waged continual war upon the  children and grandchildren of Whitehead, for a thousand generations of  dogs have fought them and hated them with a great and lasting hatred.          THE GREAT BELL    [Illustration]      The mighty Yung-lo sat on the great throne surrounded by a hundred  attendants. He was sad, for he could think of no wonderful thing to do  for his country. He flirted his silken fan nervously and snapped his  long finger-nails in the impatience of despair.    \"Woe is me!\" he cried at last, his sorrow getting the better of his  usual calmness. \"I have picked up the great capital and moved it from  the South to Peking and have built here a mighty city. I have surrounded  my city with a wall, even thicker and greater than the famous wall of  China. I have constructed in this city scores of temples and palaces.  I have had the wise men and scholars compile a great book of wisdom,  made up of 23,000 volumes, the largest and most wonderful collection  of learning ever gathered together by the hands of men. I have built  watch-towers, bridges, and giant monuments, and now, alas! as I approach  the end of my days as ruler of the Middle Kingdom there is nothing more  to be done for my people. Better far that I should even now close my  tired eyes for ever and mount up on high to be the guest of the dragon,  than live on in idleness, giving to my children an example of  uselessness and sloth.\"    \"But, your Majesty,\" began one of Yung-lo's most faithful courtiers,  named Ming-lin, falling upon his knees and knocking his head three times  on the ground, \"if you would only deign to listen to your humble slave,  I would dare to suggest a great gift for which the many people of  Peking, your children, would rise up and bless you both now and in  future generations.\"    \"Only tell me of such a gift and I will not only grant it to the  imperial city, but as a sign of thanksgiving to you for your sage  counsel I will bestow upon you the royal peacock feather.\"    \"It is not for one of my small virtues,\" replied the delighted official,  \"to wear the feather when others so much wiser are denied it, but if it  please your Majesty, remember that in the northern district of the city  there has been erected a bell-tower which as yet remains empty. The  people of the city need a giant bell to sound out the fleeting hours of  the day, that they may be urged on to perform their labours and not be  idle. The water-clock already marks the hours, but there is no bell to  proclaim them to the populace.\"    \"A good suggestion in sooth,\" answered the Emperor, smiling, \"and yet  who is there among us that has skill enough in bell-craft to do the task  you propose? I am told that to cast a bell worthy of our imperial city  requires the genius of a poet and the skill of an astronomer.\"    \"True, most mighty one, and yet permit me to say that Kwan-yu, who so  skilfully moulded the imperial cannon, can also cast a giant bell. He  alone of all your subjects is worthy of the task, for he alone can do  it justice.\"    Now, the official who proposed the name of Kwan-yu to the Emperor had  two objects in so doing. He wished to quiet the grief of Yung-lo, who  was mourning because he had nothing left to do for his people, and,  at the same time, to raise Kwan-yu to high rank, for Kwan-yu's only  daughter had for several years been"]]]
