He was thinking  how dreadful it would be if he should break his.    \"Not exactly,\" said his mother. \"I will tell you all about it. All  little Lambs have long tails----\"    \"Not so long as mine, though,\" said he, interrupting.    \"No, not so long as yours,\" she replied, \"but so long that if they were  left that way always they would make a great deal of trouble. As the  wool grows on them, they would catch burrs and sharp, prickly things,  which would pull the wool and sting the skin. The farmer knows this, so  when the little Lambs are about as old as you are now, he and his men  make their tails shorter.\"    \"Oh!\" cried the Lamb, curling his tail in as far between his legs as he  could, \"do you mean that they will shorten my tail, my beautiful long  tail?\"    \"That is just what I mean,\" said his mother, \"and you should be very  glad of it. When that is done, you will be ready to go out into the  field with me. A lot of trouble we should have if the men did not look  after such things for us; but that is what men are for, they say,--to  look after us Sheep.\"    \"But won't they laugh at me when my tail is shorter?\" asked her son.    \"They would laugh at you if you wore it long. No Lamb who pretends to be  anybody would be seen in the pasture with a dangling tail. Only wild  Sheep wear them long, poor things!\"    Now the little Lamb wished that he had not boasted so much. Now, when  the others passed him, he did not put on airs. Now he wondered why they  couldn't have short tails in the beginning. He asked his uncle, an old  Wether Sheep, why this was and his uncle laughed. \"Why, what would you  have done all these days if things happened in that way? What would you  have had to think about? What could you have talked about?\" The little  Lamb hung his head and asked no more questions.    \"What do you think?\" he called to a group of Lambs near by. \"I'm going  to have one of the men shorten my tail. It is such a bother unless one  does have it done, and mine is so very long!\"          THE WONDERFUL SHINY EGG      \"CUT-CUT-CA-DAH-CUT! Cut-cut-cut-ca-dah-cut!\" called the Dorking Hen, as  she strutted around the poultry-yard. She held her head very high, and  paused every few minutes to look around in her jerky way and see whether  the other fowls were listening. Once she even stood on her left foot  right in the pathway of the Shanghai Cock, and cackled into his very  ears.    Everybody pretended not to hear her. The people in the poultry-yard did  not like the Dorking Hen very well. They said that she put on airs.  Perhaps she did. She certainly talked a great deal of the place from  which she and the Dorking Cock came. They had come in a small cage from  a large poultry farm, and the Dorking Hen never tired of telling about  the wonderful, noisy ride that they took in a dark car drawn by a great,  black, snorting creature. She said that this creature's feet grew on to  his sides and whirled around as he ran, and that he breathed out of the  top of his head. When the fowls first heard of this, they were much  interested, but after a while they used to walk away from her, or make  believe that they saw Grasshoppers whom they wanted to chase.    When she found that people were not listening to her, she cackled louder  than ever, \"Cut-cut-ca-dah-cut! Look at the egg--the egg--the egg--the  egg that I have laid.\"    \"Is there any particular reason why we should look at the egg--the  egg--the egg--the egg that you have laid?\" asked the Shanghai Cock, who  was the grumpiest fowl in the yard.    Now, usually if the Dorking Hen had been spoken to in this way, she  would have ruffled up her head feathers and walked away, but this time  she had news to tell and so she kept her temper. \"Reason?\" she cackled.  \"Yes indeed! It is the finest egg that was ever laid in this  poultry-yard.\"    \"Hear her talk!\" said a Bantam Hen. \"I think it is in very poor taste to  lay such large eggs as most of the Hens do here. Small ones are much  more genteel.\"    \"She must forget an egg that I laid a while ago with two yolks,\" said a  Shanghai Hen. \"That was the largest egg ever laid here, and I have  always wished that I had hatched it. A pair of twin chickens would have  been so interesting.\"    \"Well,\" said the Dorking Hen, who could not keep still any longer,  \"small eggs may be genteel and large ones may be interesting, but my  last one is bee-autiful.\"    \"Perhaps you'd just as soon tell us about it as to brag without  telling?\" grumbled the Shanghai Cock. \"I suppose it is grass color, or  sky color, or hay color, or speckled, like a sparrow's egg.\"    \"No,\" answered the Dorking Hen, \"it is white, but it is shiny.\"    \"Shiny!\" they exclaimed. \"Who ever heard of a shiny egg?\"    \"Nobody,\" she replied, \"and that is why it is so wonderful.\"    \"Don't believe it,\" said the Shanghai Cock, as he turned away and began  scratching the ground.    Now the Dorking Hen did get angry. \"Come to see it, if you don't believe  me,\" she said, as she led the others into the Hen-house.    She flew up to the row of boxes where the Hens had their nests, and  picked her way along daintily until she reached the farthest one. \"Now  look,\" said she.    One by one the fowls peeped into the box, and sure enough, there it  lay, a fine, shiny, white egg. The little Bantam, who was really a  jolly, kind-hearted creature, said, \"Well, it is a beauty. I should be  proud of it myself.\"    \"It is whiter than I fancy,\" said the Shanghai Cock, \"but it certainly  does shine.\"    \"I shall hatch it,\" said the Dorking Hen, very decidedly. \"I shall hatch  it and have a beautiful Chicken with shining feathers. I shall not hatch  all the eggs in the nest, but roll this one away and sit on it.\"    \"Perhaps,\" said one of her friends, \"somebody else may have laid it  after all, and not noticed. You know it is not the only one in the  nest.\"    \"Pooh!\" said the Dorking Hen. \"I guess I know! I am sure it was not  there when I went to the nest and it was there when I left. I must have  laid it.\"    The fowls went away, and she tried to roll the shiny one away from the  other eggs, but it was slippery and very light and would not stay where  she put it. Then she got out of patience and rolled all the others out  of the nest. Two of them fell to the floor and broke, but she did not  care. \"They are nothing but common ones, anyway,\" she said.    When the farmer's wife came to gather the eggs she pecked at her and was  very cross. Every day she did this, and at last the woman let her alone.  Every-day she told the other fowls what a wonderful Chicken she expected  to have. \"Of course he will be of my color,\" said she, \"but his feathers  will shine brightly. He will be a great flyer, too. I am sure that is  what it means when the egg is light.\" She came off the nest each day  just long enough to stroll around and chat with her friends, telling  them what wonderful things she expected, and never letting them forget  that it was she who had laid the shiny egg. She pecked airily at the  food, and seemed to think that a Hen who was hatching such a wonderful  Chicken should have the best of everything. Each day she told some new  beauty that was to belong to her child, until the Shanghai Cock fairly  flapped his wings with impatience.    Day after day passed, and the garden beyond the barn showed rows of  sturdy green plants, where before there had been only straight ridges of  fine brown earth. The Swallows who were building under the eaves of the  great barn, twittered and chattered of the wild flowers in the forest,  and four other Hens came off their nests with fine broods of downy  Chickens. And still the Dorking Hen sat on her shiny egg and told what a  wonderful Chicken she expected to hatch. This was not the only egg in  the nest now, but it was the only one of which she spoke.    At last a downy Chicken peeped out of one of the common eggs, and  wriggled and twisted to free himself from the shell. His mother did not  hurry him or help him. She knew that he must not slip out of it until  all the blood from the shell-lining had run into his tender little body.  If she had pushed the shell off before he had all of this fine red  blood, he would not have been a strong Chicken, and she wanted her  children to be strong.    The Dorking Cock walked into the Hen-house and stood around on one foot.  He came to see if the shiny egg had hatched, but he wouldn't ask. He  thought himself too dignified to show any interest in newly hatched  Chickens before a Hen. Still, he saw no harm in standing around on one  foot and letting the Dorking Hen talk to him if she wanted to. When she  told him it was one of the common eggs that had hatched, he was quite  disgusted, and stalked out of doors without a word.    The truth was that he had been rather bragging to the other Cocks, and  only a few minutes later he spoke with pride of the time when \"our\"  shiny egg should hatch. \"For,\" he said, \"Mrs. Dorking and I have been  quite alone here as far as our own people are concerned. It is not  strange that we should feel a great pride in the wonderful egg and the  Chicken to be hatched from it. A Dorking is a Dorking after all, my  friends.\" And he flapped his wings, stretched his neck, and crowed as  loudly as he could.    \"Yes,\" said the Black Spanish Cock afterward, \"a Dorking certainly is a  Dorking, although I never could see the sense of making such a fuss  about it. They are fat and they have an extra toe on each foot. Why  should a fowl want extra toes? I have four on each foot, and I can  scratch up all the food I want with them.\"    \"Well,\" said the grumpy old Shanghai Cock, \"I am sick and tired of this  fuss. Common eggs are good enough for Shanghais and Black Spanish and  "]]]
