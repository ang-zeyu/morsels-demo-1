And with the manner of a person who has just  done somebody a good turn she hurried away to get the breakfast that was  waiting for her, somewhere.    Then Betsy Butterfly enjoyed a good laugh.    \"How ridiculous!\" she said to herself. \"But I won't tell Mrs. Ladybug of  her mistake, because she might feel upset if I did.\" And you can see,  just by that, how kind-hearted Betsy was. She did not even tell her own  family about the joke, for fear of hurting Mrs. Ladybug's feelings.    But jealous little Mrs. Ladybug had no such misgivings. _She_ went out  of her way to explain to people that if they noticed a change in Betsy  Butterfly's appearance, they might thank _her_ for it.... \"I told Betsy  that she ought to brush the dust off herself,\" she informed her friends.    Naturally she was displeased when she met Betsy that very afternoon and  saw that the dust still lay thick on her wings.    \"I believe you actually want to be untidy!\" Mrs. Ladybug cried. \"And  if you aren't going to brush that dust off, I shall do it myself!\" And  grasping a small Indian paint-brush, the weight of which she could  scarcely stagger under, Mrs. Ladybug advanced upon Betsy Butterfly with  a determined look in her eye.    \"Oh, don't do that!\" cried Betsy.    \"It's my painful duty to give you a thorough dusting,\" Mrs. Ladybug  declared.          VII    BUTTERFLY BILL      NOW, a crowd had gathered quickly around Betsy Butterfly and Mrs.  Ladybug; for the field people are quick to notice anything unusual.  And a sprightly young cousin of Betsy's known as Butterfly Bill said  to Mrs. Ladybug, with a wink at everybody else:    \"I suppose you'll dust the rest of us, too?\"    \"Only those that need it!\" replied Mrs. Ladybug.    \"Then you'll have your hands full,\" Butterfly Bill told her. \"Maybe you  haven't noticed that every member of the Butterfly family in Pleasant  Valley is covered with dust just as Betsy is.\"    Mrs. Ladybug looked surprised.    \"Is that so?\" she said faintly.    \"It certainly is!\" Bill cried. \"Maybe you never knew that the dust is  what gives us our--_ahem_--our beautiful colors,\" he added proudly. \"And  I warn you that if you so much as touch my lovely cousin with that brush  you'll have every one of us fellows in your hair.\"    Of course poor Mrs. Ladybug was quite bald. But she knew what Butterfly  Bill meant. And she was so upset that she promptly let the paint-brush  fall to the ground.    Then Betsy's cousin nodded approvingly.    \"Now you'd better hurry home,\" he told Mrs. Ladybug. \"There's a rumor  around the meadow that your house is on fire. And they say your  children are in great danger.\"    Little Mrs. Ladybug at once fell to weeping.    \"It's that horrid Freddie Firefly!\" she shrieked. \"I've told him to keep  away from my home. I've told him that he would set it to blazing with  that light of his. But he's forever sneaking around my house as soon as  my back is turned.\"    \"There, there! Don't be frightened!\" Betsy Butterfly said to her  soothingly. \"It's only a rumor, you know.\"    \"That's so,\" Mrs. Ladybug admitted, drying her eyes. \"I hear it almost  every day, too. But I never can get used to it.... I suppose this is  only a false alarm, after all.\"    \"I wouldn't be so sure about that,\" Butterfly Bill said wickedly, with  a shake of his head. \"And if I were you I'd look after my own family a  little more carefully, instead of troubling myself with other people's  affairs.\"    Several of Bill's friends applauded his speech. But Betsy Butterfly  whispered to him to hush.    \"Don't you see that Mrs. Ladybug is not quite herself?\" she asked him.    But Butterfly Bill was not a person to be easily silenced like that.    \"She's a meddling busybody!\" he declared. \"And it's my opinion that she  ought to be put where she'll have to mind her own business.\"    \"Who--me?\" called a wheezing voice right in his ear.    Turning, Butterfly Bill saw that it was Jennie Junebug who had spoken  to him. She had noticed the crowd from a distance. And she had just  arrived, quite out of breath.    Before Betsy Butterfly's cousin Bill could answer, Jennie Junebug  actually threatened him.    \"If you were talking about me I shall have to knock you down,\" she  declared.    He had heard that Jennie delighted in flying _bang_ into anybody. But  he did not know that she indulged in that unladylike trick _only after  dark_.    \"Of course I didn't mean you!\" he said hastily.    \"And I hope you didn't mean my friend Mrs. Ladybug, either,\" Jennie  Junebug added. \"For if you did----\"    But Butterfly Bill waited to hear no more. Thoroughly frightened, he  sought safety in flight. And as he flew away Mrs. Ladybug couldn't help  noticing the dust on his wings.    \"They're certainly a peculiar lot--that Butterfly family!\" she  muttered.          VIII    DO YOU LIKE BUTTER?      AFTER Mrs. Ladybug failed in her attempt to brush the dust off Betsy  Butterfly she grew more jealous of Betsy than ever.    It was really a shame that Mrs. Ladybug should feel like that. Usually  she was quite harmless, even if she was a busybody and a gossip. But she  simply couldn't forgive Betsy Butterfly for being so beautiful. And now  Mrs. Ladybug began to neglect her children more than ever, in order to  spy upon Betsy in the hope of discovering some new fault in her.    Betsy Butterfly soon noticed that wherever she went she was sure to see  Mrs. Ladybug, who had a way of bobbing up in a most startling fashion.  But Betsy was always quite polite to the jealous little creature. And  she never failed to inquire for her health and that of her children as  well, even if she met Mrs. Ladybug a dozen times a day.    For some reason Mrs. Ladybug seemed quite touchy, where her family was  concerned.    \"You don't need to ask about my children,\" she told Betsy at last in a  somewhat sharp tone. \"They are in the best of health. And I'll let you  know in case they fall ill.... It's strange,\" she continued, \"how  everybody in this neighborhood is always prying into my household  affairs.\"    Betsy Butterfly smiled to herself. She did not care to quarrel with Mrs.  Ladybug--nor with anyone else, for that matter. So she abruptly  changed the subject.    \"Do you like butter?\" she asked.    \"Why, no!\" said Mrs. Ladybug. \"I don't care anything about it. At least,  I never ate any.\"    \"Then I don't see how you know whether you like it or not,\" Betsy  observed, \"unless you've looked into a buttercup to find out.\"    Mrs. Ladybug was interested, in spite of herself.    \"Can a person tell by doing that?\" she wanted to know.    \"It's a sure way,\" said Betsy Butterfly. \"I was just looking into this  buttercup that I'm sitting on when you flew up and spoke to me.\"    \"Do _you_ like butter?\" Mrs. Ladybug inquired.    \"I'm afraid not,\" Betsy told her.    \"I'd like to try, myself,\" Mrs. Ladybug exclaimed eagerly. \"But I don't  know how.\"    \"It's simple enough,\" Betsy Butterfly replied. \"You just look into a  buttercup blossom.    \"And if it makes your face yellow, then you're fond of butter--whether  you ever had any or not.\"    So Mrs. Ladybug perched herself on a big blossom and peered earnestly  into its cup.    \"Is my face yellow?\" she asked Betsy.    \"I do believe it is!\" Betsy Butterfly cried.    And Mrs. Ladybug looked much pleased.    \"I've always known I had refined tastes,\" she remarked with a lofty air.  \"And now I'd like to sample a bit of butter; but I don't know where to  find any.\"    \"Butter? They make it at the farmhouse,\" Betsy informed her.    \"Then perhaps Farmer Green's wife will let me have a little,\" Mrs.  Ladybug said hopefully. \"I'll go over to the farmhouse at once.... It's  too bad you don't like butter, too,\" she added.    But secretly she was delighted that Betsy Butterfly had looked into a  buttercup in vain.          IX    UNEXPECTED NEWS      LITTLE Mrs. Ladybug had a disappointment when she reached the farmhouse.  She found, to her dismay, that she couldn't get inside it; for wire  screens blocked her way through both doors and windows. And nobody paid  the slightest attention to her when she stopped at the buttery window  and asked if she couldn't please have a bit of butter.    There was plenty of golden butter right there in plain sight, since it  happened to be churning day. And Farmer Green's wife, with her sleeves  rolled above her elbows, was working busily on the other side of the  window screen.    \"I should think she might easily spare me a small sample!\" Mrs. Ladybug  cried at last. \"I'm afraid Farmer Green's wife is stingy.\"    Mrs. Ladybug hoped that Johnnie Green's mother would hear her remark.  But she didn't. And in the end Mrs. Ladybug had to fly away with her  longing for butter still unsatisfied.    Meanwhile Betsy Butterfly had been amusing herself in the meadow to her  heart's content. To tell the truth, it was rather a relief to be rid of  Mrs. Ladybug's society for so long a time. And Betsy hoped that Mrs.  Ladybug's errand to the farmhouse would keep that busybody engaged for  the rest of the day.    Now, after she left the farmhouse Mrs. Ladybug set out to find Betsy  Butterfly again. But meeting Daddy Longlegs near the stone wall, she  stopped to gossip with him, telling him how she had learned that she  liked butter, and explaining that she had not yet tasted any.    \"So you looked into a buttercup to find out, eh?\" said Daddy Longlegs.  \"I'll have to do that, myself. Maybe I've always liked butter, too,  without knowing that I do.\"    \"You can't tell till you try,\" Mrs. Ladybug remarked. \"But you mustn't  be too sure. You may be disappointed. There's Betsy Butterfly! She  doesn't care for butter at all.\"    \"Are you sure about that?\" Daddy Longlegs inquired. \"Really, I think you  must be mistaken, for I saw her with her face just _buried_ in butter  this very day.\"    At first Mrs. Ladybug looked at him in amazement. And then she grew very  angry.    \""]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21324"],[0,"Recollections of Old Liverpool (#3)"],[1," would insist  upon my mother accepting a beautiful chain, of Indian workmanship, to  which was attached the miniature of a very lovely woman.  I doubt the  rascal did not come by it very honestly, neither was a costly bracelet  that one of my father's best hands (once a Northwich salt-flatman)  brought home for my baby sister.  This man would insist upon putting it  on the baby somewhere, in spite of all my mother and the nurse could say;  so, as its thigh was the nearest approach to the bracelet in size of any  of its little limbs, there the bracelet was clasped.  It fitted tightly  and baby evidently did not approve of the ornament.  My mother took it  off when the man left.  I have it now.  This man used to tell queer  stories about the salt trade, and the fortunes made therein, and how they  used to land salt on stormy and dark nights on the Cheshire or Lancashire  borders, or into boats alongside, substituting the same weight of water  as the salt taken out, so that the cargo should pass muster at the  Liverpool Custom House.  The duty was payable at the works, and the cargo  was re-weighed in Liverpool.  If found over weight, the merchant had to  pay extra duty; and if short weight, he had to make up the deficiency in  salt.  The trade required a large capital, and was, therefore, in few  hands.  One house is known to have paid as much as 30,000 pounds for duty  in six weeks.  My grandfather told me that in 1732 (time of William and  Mary), when he was a boy, the duty on salt was levied for a term of years  at first, but made perpetual in the third year of George II.  Sir R.  Walpole proposed to set apart the proceeds of the impost for his  majesty's use.    The Salt houses occupied the site of Orford-street (called after Mr.  Blackburne's seat in Cheshire).  I have often heard my grandfather speak  of them as an intolerable nuisance, causing, at times, the town to be  enveloped in steam and smoke.  These Salt houses raised such an outcry at  last that in 1703 they were removed to Garston, Mr. Blackburne having  obtained an act of Parliament relative to them for that purpose.    The fine and coarse salts manufactured in Liverpool were in the  proportion of fifteen tons of Northwich or Cheshire rock-salt to  forty-five tons of seawater, to produce thirteen tons of salt.  To show  how imperishable salt must be, if such testimony be needed, it is a fact  that, in the yard of a warehouse occupied by a friend of mine in  Orford-street, the soil was always damp previous to a change of weather,  and a well therein was of no use whatever, except for cleansing purposes,  so brackish was the water.    To return to the launch.  After the feasting was over my father treated  our friends to the White House and Ranelagh Tea Gardens, which stood at  the top of Ranelagh-street.  The site is now occupied by the Adelphi  Hotel.  The gardens extended a long way back.  Warren-street is formed  out of them.  These gardens were very tastefully arranged in beds and  borders, radiating from a centre in which was a Chinese temple, which  served as an orchestra for a band to play in.  Round the sides of the  garden, in a thicket of lilacs and laburnums, the beauty of which, in  early summer, was quite remarkable, were little alcoves or bowers wherein  parties took tea or stronger drinks.  About half-way up the garden, the  place where the Warren-street steps are now, there used to be a large  pond or tank wherein were fish of various sorts.  These fish were so tame  that they would come to the surface to be fed.  This fish feeding was a  very favourite amusement with those who frequented the garden.  In the  tank were some carp of immense size, and so fat they could hardly swim.  Our servant-man used to take me to the Ranelagh Gardens every fine  afternoon, as it was a favourite lounge.  Over the garden door was  written--        \"You are welcome to walk here I say,      But if flower or fruit you pluck      One shilling you must pay.\"    The garden paling was carried up Copperas-hill (called after the Copperas  Works, removed in 1770, after long litigation) across to Brownlow-hill, a  white ropery extending behind the palings.  To show how remarkably  neighbourhoods alter by time and circumstance, I recollect it was said  that Lord Molyneux, while hunting, once ran a hare down Copperas-hill.  A  young lady, Miss Harvey, who resided near the corner, went out to see  what was the cause of the disturbance she heard, when observing the hare,  she turned it back.  Miss Harvey used to say \"the gentlemen swore  terribly\" at her for spoiling their sport.  This was not seventy years  ago!    To return to the Ranelagh Gardens.  There was, at the close of the gala  nights, as they were called, a display of fireworks.  They were let off  on the terrace.  I went to see the last exhibition which took place in  1780.  There was, on that occasion, a concert in which Miss Brent, (who  was, by the way, a great favourite) appeared.  Jugglers used to exhibit  in the concert-room, which was very capacious, as it would hold at least  800 to 1000 persons.  This concert-room was also used as a dinner-room on  great occasions, and also as a town ball-room.  Stephens gave his lecture  on \"Heads\" in it very frequently.    G. A. Stephens was an actor, who, after playing about in the provincial  highways and bye-ways of the dramatic world, went to London, where he was  engaged at Covent Garden in second and third rate parts.  He was a man of  dissipated habits, but a jovial and merry companion.  He wrote a great  many very clever songs, which he sang with great humour.  He got the idea  of the lectures on \"Heads\" from a working man about one of the theatres,  whom he saw imitating some of the members of the corporation of the town  in which he met with him.  Stephens, who was quick and ready with his  pen, in a short time got up his lecture, which he delivered all through  England, Scotland, Ireland, and America.  He realised upwards of 10,000  pounds, which he took care of, as he left that sum behind him at his  death, in 1784.  He was at the time, a completely worn-out, imbecile old  man.  Many of the leading actors of his day followed up the lecture on  \"Heads,\" in which they signally failed to convey the meaning of the  author.  I saw him, and was very much amused; but I do not think he would  be tolerated in the present day.  The elder Mathews evidently caught the  idea of his \"At Homes\" from Stephens's lecture.    Brownlow-hill was so called after Mr. Lawrence Brownlow, a gentleman who  held much property thereabout.  Brownlow-hill was a very pleasant walk.  There were gardens on it, as, also, on Mount Pleasant, then called  Martindale's-hill, of which our friend Mr. Roscoe has sung so sweetly.  Martindale's-hill was quite a country walk when I was a little boy.  There was also a pleasant walk over the Moss Lake Fields to Edge Hill.  Where the Eye and Ear Infirmary stands there was a stile and a foot-path  to the Moss Lake Brook, across it was a wooden foot bridge.  The path  afterwards diverged to Smithdown-lane.  The path-road also went on to  Pembroke-place, along the present course of Crown-street.  I have heard  my father speak of an attempt being made to rob him on passing over the  stile which stood where now you find the King William Tavern.  He drew  his sword (a weapon commonly worn by gentlemen of the time) which so  frightened the thieves that they ran away, and, in their flight, went  into a pit of water, into which my father also ran in the darkness which  prevailed.  The thieves roared loudly for help, which my father did not  stop to accord them.  He, being a good swimmer, soon got out, leaving the  thieves to extricate themselves as they could.  There were several very  pleasant country walks which went up to Low-hill through Brownlow-street,  and by Love-lane (now Fairclough-lane).  I recollect going along  Love-lane many a time with my dear wife, when we were sweethearting.  We  used to go to Low-hill and thence along Everton-road (then called  Everton-lane), on each side of which was a row of large trees, and we  returned by Loggerhead's-lane (now Everton Crescent), and so home by  Richmond-row, (called after Dr. Sylvester Richmond, a physician greatly  esteemed and respected.)  I recollect very well the brook that ran along  the present Byrom-street, whence the tannery on the right-hand side was  supplied with water.  At the bottom of Richmond-row used to be the  kennels of the Liverpool Hunt Club.  They were at one time kept on the  North-shore.          CHAPTER II.      I was very sorry when the Ranelagh Gardens were broken up.  The owner,  Mr. Gibson, was the brother of the Mr. Gibson who kept the Folly Gardens  at the bottom of Folly-lane (now Islington) and top of Shaw's Brow  (called after Mr. Alderman Shaw, the great potter, who lived in  Dale-street, at the corner of Fontenoy-street--whose house is still  standing).  Many a time have I played in the Folly Tea Gardens.  It was a  pretty place, and great was the regret of the inhabitants of Liverpool  when it was resolved to build upon it.  The Folly was closed in 1785.  Mr. Philip Christian built his house, now standing at the corner of  Christian-street, of the bricks of which the Tavern was constructed.  The  Folly was a long two-storied house, with a tower or gazebo at one end.  Gibson, it was said, was refused permission to extend the size of his  house, so \"he built it upright,\" as he said \"he could not build it  along.\"  The entrance to the Gardens was from Folly-lane, up a rather  narrow passage.  I rather think the little passage at the back of the  first house in Christian-street was a part of it.  You entered through a  wooden door and went along a shrubberied path which led to the Tavern.  Folly-lane (now Islington) was a narrow country lane, with fields and  gardens on both sides.  I recollect there was a small gardener's cottage  where the Friends' Institute "]]]
