Henry  VIII. and the reign of Edward VI., &c. Afterwards he retired to his  native country, without the honour of a Degree, and settled at Smeeth,  where he found great encouragement in his studies from his kinsman,  Sir Thomas Scot. _About which time, taking to him a wife, he gave  himself up solely to solid reading_, to the perusing of obscure  authors that had, by the generality of scholars, been neglected, and  at times of leisure to husbandry and gardening. He died in September  or October in 1599, and was buried among his ancestors, in the church  at Smeeth before mentioned.\" Retired as his life and obscure as his  death might be, he is one whose name will be remembered as long as  vigorous sense, flowing from the \"wells of English undefiled,\" hearty  and radiant humour, and sterling patriotism, are considered as  deserving of commemoration. His _Discoverie of Witchcraft_, first  published in 1584, is indeed a treat to him who wishes to study the  idioms, manners, opinions, and superstitions of the reign of  Elizabeth. Its entire title deserves to be given:--    \"_The discouerie of witchcraft, wherein the lewde dealing of witches  and witchmongers is notablie detected, the knauerie of coniurors, the  impietie of inchantors, the follie of soothsaiers, the impudent  falshood of cousenors, the infidelitie of atheists, the pestilent  practises of Pythonists, the curiositie of figurecasters, the vanitie  of dreamers, the beggerlie art of Alcumystrie, the abhomination of  idolatrie, the horrible art of poisoning, the vertue and power of  naturall magike, and all the conueiances of Legierdemaine and iuggling  are deciphered: and many other things opened, which haue long lien  hidden, howbeit verie necessarie to be knowne. Heerevnto is added a  treatise vpon the nature and substance of spirits and diuels, &c: all  latelie written by Reginald Scot Esquire._ 1 John, 4, 1. _Beleeue not  euerie spirit but trie the spirits, whether they are of God; for many  false prophets are gone out into the world, &c._ 1584.\"    [Footnote 14: Reginald Scot.]    [Footnote 15: Sir R. Filmer.]    [Footnote 16: John Wagstaffe.]    [Footnote 17: John Webster.]    This title is sufficient to show that he gives no quarter to the  delusion he undertakes to expose, and though he does not deny that  there may be witches in the abstract, (to have done so would have left  him a preacher without an audience,) yet he guards so cautiously  against any practical application of that principle, and battles so  vigorously against the error which assimilated the witches of modern  times to the witches of Scripture, and, denying the validity of the  confessions of those convicted, throws such discredit and ridicule  upon the whole system, that the popular belief cannot but have  received a severe shock from the publication of his work.[18] By an  extraordinary elevation of good sense, he managed, not only to see  through the absurdities of witchcraft, but likewise of other errors  which long maintained their hold upon the learned as well as the  vulgar. Indeed, if not generally more enlightened, he was, in some  respects, more emancipated from delusion than even his great  successor, the learned and sagacious Webster, who, a century after,  clung still to alchemy which Reginald Scot had ridiculed and exposed.  Yet with all its strong points and broad humour, it is undeniable that  _The Discoverie of Witchcraft_ only scotched the snake instead of  killing it; and that its effect was any thing but final and complete.  Inveterate error is seldom prostrated by a blow from one hand, and  truth seems to be a tree which cannot be forced by planting it before  its time. There was something, too, in the book itself which militated  against its entire acceptance by the public. It is intended to form a  little Encyclopaedia of the different arts of imposition practised in  Scot's time; and in order to illustrate the various tricks and modes  of cozenage, he gives us so many charms and diagrams and conjurations,  to say nothing of an inventory of seventy-nine devils and spirits, and  their several seignories and degrees, that the _Occult Philosophy_ of  Cornelius Agrippa himself looks scarcely less appalling, at first  sight, than the _Discoverie_. This gave some colour to the declamation  of the author's opponents, who held him up as Wierus had been  represented before him, as if he were as deeply dipped in diabolical  practises as any of those whom he defended. Atheist and Sadducee, if  not very wizard himself, were the terms in which his name was  generally mentioned, and as such, the royal author of the _Demonology_  anathematizes him with great unction and very edifying horror. Against  the papists, the satire of Scot had been almost as much directed as  against what he calls the \"witch-mongers,\" so that that very powerful  party were to a man opposed to him. Vigorous, therefore, as was his  onslaught, its effect soon passed by; and when on the accession of  James, the statute which so long disgraced our penal code was enacted,  as the adulatory tribute of all parties, against which no honest voice  was raised, to the known opinions of the monarch, Scot became too  unfashionable to be seen on the tables of the great or in the  libraries of the learned. If he were noticed, it was only to be  traduced as a sciolist, (imperitus dialecticae et aliarum bonarum  artium, says Dr. Reynolds,) and to be exposed for imagined lapses in  scholarship in an age when for a writer not to be a scholar, was like  a traveller journeying without a passport. Meric Casaubon, who  carried all the prejudices of the time of James the first into the  reign of Charles the second, but who, though overshadowed by the fame  of his father, was no unworthy scion of that incomparable stock, at  the same time that he denounces Scot as illiterate, will only  acknowledge to having met with him \"at friends houses\" and  \"booksellers shops,\" as if his work were one which would bring  contamination to a scholar's library. Scot was certainly not a scholar  in the sense in which the term is applied to the Scaligers, Casaubons,  and Vossius's, though he would have been considered a prodigy of  reading in these days of superficial acquisition. But he had original  gifts far transcending scholarship. He had a manly, straightforward,  vigorous understanding, which, united with an honest integrity of  purpose, kept him right when greater men went wrong. How invaluable a  phalanx would the battalion of folios which the reign of James the  first produced now afford us, if the admirable mother-wit and  single-minded sincerity of Reginald Scot could only have vivified and  informed them.[19]    [Footnote 18: In the epistle to his kinsman Sir Thomas Scot, prefixed  to his _Discoverie_, he observes:--    \"I see among other malefactors manie poore old women conuented before  you for working of miracles, other wise called witchcraft, and  therefore I thought you also a meet person to whom I might commend my  booke.\"--And he then proceeds, in the following spirited and gallant  strain, to run his course against the Dagon of popular superstition:--    \"I therefore (at this time) doo onelie desire you to consider of my  report, concerning the euidence that is commonlie brought before you  against them. See first whether the euidence be not friuolous, &  whether the proofs brought against them be not incredible, consisting  of ghesses, presumptions, & impossibilities contrarie to reason,  scripture, and nature. See also what persons complaine vpon them,  whether they be not of the basest, the vnwisest, & most faithles kind  of people.

Naie (if  it please your Worship) I haue further proofe: I was with a wise  woman, and she told me I had an ill neighbour, & that she would come  to my house yer it were long, and so did she; and that she had a marke  aboue hir waste, & so had she: and God forgiue me, my stomach hath  gone against hir a great while.

Further, if you shall see that  infidelitie, poperie, and manie other manifest heresies be backed and  shouldered, and their professors animated and hartened, by yeelding to  creatures such infinit power as is wrested out of Gods hand, and  attributed to witches: finallie, if you shall perceiue that I haue  faithfullie and trulie deliuered and set downe the condition and state  of the witch, and also of the witchmonger, and haue confuted by reason  and lawe, and by the word of God it selfe, all mine aduersaries  obiections and arguments: then let me haue your countenance against  them that maliciouslie oppose themselues against me.    \"_My greatest aduersaries are yoong ignorance and old custome._ For  what follie soeuer tract of time hath fostered, it is so  superstitiouslie pursued of some, as though no error could be  acquainted with custome.

For every  man who thinks and lives by thought must have his own scepticism, that  which stops at the question, that which ends in denial, or that which  leads to faith and which is somehow integrated into the faith which  transcends it. And Pascal, as the type of one kind of religious  believer, which is highly passionate and ardent, but passionate only  through a powerful and regulated intellect, is in the first sections of  his unfinished Apology for Christianity facing unflinchingly the demon  of doubt which is inseparable from the spirit of belief.    There is accordingly something quite different from an influence which  would prove Pascal's weakness; there is a real affinity between his  doubt and that of Montaigne; and through the common kinship with  Montaigne Pascal is related to the noble and distinguished line of  French moralists, from La Rochefoucauld down. In the honesty with which  they face the _donnees_ of the actual world this French tradition has a  unique quality in European literature, and in the seventeenth century  Hobbes is crude and uncivilised in comparison.    Pascal is a man of the world among ascetics, and an ascetic among men of  the world; he had the knowledge of worldliness and the passion of  asceticism, and in him the two are fused into an individual whole. The  majority of mankind is lazy-minded, incurious, absorbed in vanities, and  tepid in emotion, and is therefore incapable of either much doubt or  much faith; and when the ordinary man calls himself a sceptic or an  unbeliever, that is ordinarily a simple pose, cloaking a disinclination  to think anything out to a conclusion. Pascal's disillusioned analysis  of human bondage is sometimes interpreted to mean that Pascal was really  and finally an unbeliever, who, in his despair, was incapable of  enduring reality and enjoying the heroic satisfaction of the free man's  worship of nothing. His despair, his disillusion, are, however, no  illustration of personal weakness; they are perfectly objective, because  they are essential moments in the progress of the intellectual soul; and  for the type of Pascal they are the analogue of the drought, the dark  night, which is an essential stage in the progress of the Christian  mystic. A similar despair, when it is arrived at by a diseased character  or an impure soul, may issue in the most disastrous consequences though  with the most superb manifestations; and thus we get _Gulliver's  Travels_; but in Pascal we find no such distortion; his despair is in  itself more terrible than Swift's, because our heart tells us that it  corresponds exactly to the facts and cannot be dismissed as mental  disease; but it was also a despair which was a necessary prelude to, and  element in, the joy of faith.    I do not wish to enter any further than necessary upon the question of  the heterodoxy of Jansenism; and it is no concern of this essay, whether  the Five Propositions condemned at Rome were really maintained by  Jansenius in his book _Augustinus_; or whether we should deplore or  approve the consequent decay (indeed with some persecution) of  Port-Royal. It is impossible to discuss the matter without becoming  involved as a controversialist either for or against Rome. But in a man  of the type of Pascal--and the type always exists--there is, I think, an  ingredient of what may be called Jansenism of temperament, without  identifying it with the Jansenism of Jansenius and of other devout and  sincere, but not immensely gifted doctors.[B] It is accordingly needful  to state in brief what the dangerous doctrine of Jansenius was, without  advancing too far into theological refinements. It is recognised in  Christian theology--and indeed on a lower plane it is recognised by all  men in affairs of daily life--that freewill or the natural effort and  ability of the individual man, and also supernatural _grace_, a gift  accorded we know not quite how, are both required, in co-operation, for  salvation. Though numerous theologians have set their wits at the  problem, it ends in a mystery which we can perceive but not finally  decipher. At least, it is obvious that, like any doctrine, a slight  excess or deviation to one side or the other will precipitate a heresy.  The Pelagians, who were refuted by St. Augustine, emphasised the  efficacy of human effort and belittled the importance of supernatural  grace. The Calvinists emphasised the degradation of man through Original  Sin, and considered mankind so corrupt that the will was of no avail;  and thus fell into the doctrine of predestination. It was upon the  doctrine of grace according to St. Augustine that the Jansenists relied;  and the _Augustinus_ of Jansenius was presented as a sound exposition of  the Augustinian views.        [B] The great man of Port-Royal was of course Saint-Cyran, but any      one who is interested will certainly consult, first of all, the book      of Sainte-Beuve mentioned.    Such heresies are never antiquated, because they forever assume new  forms. For instance, the insistence upon good works and \"service\" which  is preached from many quarters, or the simple faith that any one who  lives a good and useful life need have no \"morbid\" anxieties about  salvation, is a form of Pelagianism. On the other hand, one sometimes  hears enounced the view that it will make no real difference if all the  traditional religious sanctions for moral behaviour break down, because  those who are born and bred to be nice people will always prefer to  behave nicely, and those who are not will behave otherwise in any case:  and this is surely a form of predestination--for the hazard of being  born a nice person or not is as uncertain as the gift of grace.    It is likely that Pascal was attracted as much by the fruits of  Jansenism in the life of Port-Royal as by the doctrine itself. This  devout, ascetic, thoroughgoing society, striving heroically in the midst  of a relaxed and easy-going Christianity, was formed to attract a nature  so concentrated, so passionate, and so thoroughgoing as Pascal's. But  the insistence upon the degraded and helpless state of man, in  Jansenism, is something also to which we must be grateful, for to it we  owe the magnificent analysis of human motives and occupations which was  to have constituted the early part of his book. And apart from the  Jansenism which is the work of a not very eminent bishop who wrote a  Latin treatise which is now unread, there is also, so to speak, a  Jansenism of the individual biography. A moment of Jansenism may  naturally take place, and take place rightly, in the individual;  particularly in the life of a man of great and intense intellectual  powers, who cannot avoid seeing through human beings and observing the  vanity of their thoughts and of their avocations, their dishonesty and  self-deceptions, the insincerity of their emotions, their cowardice, the  pettiness of their real ambitions. Actually, considering that Pascal  died at the age of thirty-nine, one must be amazed at the balance and  justice of his observations; much greater maturity is required for these  qualities, than for any mathematical or scientific greatness. How easily  his brooding on _the misery of man without God_ might have encouraged in  him the sin of spiritual pride, the _concupiscence de l'esprit_, and how  fast a hold he has of humility!    And although Pascal brings to his work the same powers which he exerted  in science, it is not as a scientist that he presents himself. He does  not seem to say to the reader: I am one of the most distinguished  scientists of the day; I understand many matters which will always be  mysteries to you, and through science I have come to the Faith; you  therefore who are not initiated into science ought to have faith if I  have it. He is fully aware of the difference of subject-matter; and his  famous distinction between the _esprit de geometrie_ and the _esprit de  finesse_ is one to ponder over. It is the just combination of the  scientist, the _honnete homme_, and the religious nature with a  passionate craving for God, that makes Pascal unique. He succeeds where  Descartes fails; for in Descartes the element of _esprit de geometrie_  is excessive.[C] And in a few phrases about Descartes, in the present  book, Pascal laid his finger on the place of weakness.        [C] For a brilliant criticism of the errors of Descartes from a      theological point of view the reader is referred to _Three      Reformers_ by Jacques Maritain (translation published by Sheed &      Ward).    He who reads this book will observe at once its fragmentary nature; but  only after some study will perceive that the fragmentariness lies in the  expression more than in the thought. The \"thoughts\" cannot be detached  from each other and quoted as if each were complete in itself. _Le coeur  a ses raisons que la raison ne connait point_: how often one has heard  that quoted, and quoted often to the wrong purpose! For this is by no  means an exaltation of the \"heart\" over the \"head,\" a defence of  unreason. The heart, in Pascal's terminology, is itself truly rational  if it is truly the heart. For him, in theological matters, which seemed  to him much larger, more difficult, and more important than scientific  matters, the whole personality is involved.    We cannot quite understand any of the parts, fragmentary as they are,  without some understanding of the whole. Capital, for instance, is his  analysis of the _three orders_: the order of nature, the order of mind,  and the order of charity. These three are _discontinuous_; the higher is  not implicit in the lower as in an evolutionary doctrine it would be.[D]  In this distinction Pascal offers much about which the modern world  would do well to think. And indeed, because of his unique combination  and balance of qualities, I know of no"]]]
