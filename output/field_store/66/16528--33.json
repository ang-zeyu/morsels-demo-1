Reserve one  pint of this soup to use with spaghetti. Serve buttered and browned  crackers with the soup.      ~VEGETABLE BROTH~--Take turnips, carrots, potatoes, beets, celery, all,  or two or three, and chop real fine. Then mix with them an equal amount  of cold water, put in a kettle, just bring to a boil, not allowing it to  boil for about three or four hours, and then drain off the water. The  flavor will be gone from the vegetables and will be in the broth.      ~VEGETABLE SOUP~--Take one-half a turnip, two carrots, three potatoes,  three onions and a little cabbage. Run through a meat chopper with  coarse cutter and put to cook in cold water. Cook about three hours. If  you wish you can put a little bit of cooking oil in. When cooked add one  quart of tomatoes. This will need about six quarts of water.    The most nutritious soups are made from peas and beans.      ~VEGETABLE SOUP~ (without stock)--One-half cup each of carrot and  turnip, cut into small pieces, three-fourths cup of celery, cut fine,  one very small onion sliced thin, four level tablespoons of butter,  three-fourths cup of potato, cut into small dice, one and one-half  quarts of boiling water, salt and pepper to taste. Prepare the  vegetables and cook the carrot, celery and onion in the butter for ten  minutes without browning. Add the potato and cook for three minutes  longer, then add the water and cook slowly for one hour. Rub through a  sieve, add salt and pepper to taste, and a little butter if desired.      ~WHITE SOUP~--Put six pounds of lean gravy beef into a saucepan, with  half gallon of water and stew gently until all the good is extracted and  remove beef. Add to the liquor six pounds of knuckle of veal, one-fourth  pound ham, four onions, four heads of celery, cut into small pieces, a  few peppercorns and bunch of sweet herbs. Stew gently for seven or eight  hours, skimming off the fat as it rises to the top. Mix with the crumbs  of two French rolls two ounces of blanched sweet almonds and put in a  saucepan with a pint of cream and a little stock, boil ten minutes, then  pass through a silk sieve, using a wooden spoon in the process. Mix the  cream and almonds with the soup, turn into a tureen, and serve.      ~WINE SOUP~--Put the yolks of twelve eggs and whites of six in an  enameled saucepan and beat thoroughly. Pour in one and a half breakfast  cupfuls of water, add six ounces of loaf sugar, the grated rind and  strained juice of a large lemon, one and one-half pints of white wine.  Whisk the soup over a gentle fire until on the point of boiling,  removing immediately. Turn into a tureen, and serve with a plate of  sponge cakes or fancy biscuits. (This soup should be served as soon as  taken from fire.)      ~CHESTNUT SOUP~--Peel and blanch the chestnuts, boil them in salted  water until quite soft, pass through a sieve, add more water if too  thick, and a spoonful of butter or several of sweet cream, season to  taste, and serve with small squares of bread fried crisp in butter or  olive oil.          FISH      ~BOILED CODFISH, WITH CREAM SAUCE~--Take out the inside of a cod by the  white skin of the belly, taking care to remove all blood. Place the fish  in a kettle with salted cold water; boil fast at first, then slowly.  When done take out and skin. Pour over it a sauce made as follows:    One-fourth pound butter put into a stewpan with one tablespoonful of  flour, moistened with one pint of cream or rich milk, and salt and  pepper, and also one teaspoonful essence of anchovies. Place the pan  over the fire and let thicken, but not boil.      ~BOILED MACKEREL~--Prepare and clean some mackerel. Put in water and  boil until they are done. When cooked, drain and put the mackerel on a  hot dish. Blanch some fennel in salted water. When it is soft drain and  chop finely. Put one tablespoonful in half pint of butter sauce. Serve  in a sauce boat with the fish.      ~BOILED SALMON WITH SAUCE TARTARE~--Scrape the skin of the fish, wipe,  and if you have no regular fish kettle with a perforated lid, tie in a  piece of cheesecloth and place gently in a kettle of boiling salted  water. Push the kettle back on the fire (where it will simmer gently,  instead of boiling hard) and cook, allowing about six minutes to the  pound. Remove carefully, drain, and chill. If the fish breaks and looks  badly take out the bones, flake, pile lightly on the platter and pour  the sauce over it. This may be a hot sauce Hollandaise or a cold sauce  tartare.      ~BROILED MACKEREL~--Draw and wash the mackerel. Cut off heads and rub  over with salt and leave for an hour. Rub a gridiron with olive oil, lay  the mackerel on it and broil over a charcoal fire. Place some chopped  parsley and onions on a hot dish, with the hot fish, squeezing over the  mackerel a little lemon juice. Serve hot.      ~BROILED MACKEREL, WITH BLACK BUTTER~--Take some mackerel, open and  remove bones. Season with butter, pepper, and salt. Place the fish on a  gridiron and broil over a clear fire. Put a part of the butter in a  saucepan and stir it over the fire until it is richly browned, squeezing  into it a little lemon juice. Place the fish on a hot dish, arrange some  sprigs of parsley around it, and pour over it the butter sauce, and  serve hot.      ~CODFISH CONES~--When it is not convenient to make and fry fish balls  try this substitute. Pick enough salt codfish into shreds to measure two  cups and let stand in cold water for two or more hours, then drain dry.  Make a sauce from one cup of hot milk, two level tablespoons each of  flour and butter, and cook five minutes. Mash and season enough hot  boiled potatoes to measure two cups, add the sauce and the fish and beat  well with a fork. Shape in small cones, set on a butter pan, brush with  melted butter and scatter fine bread crumbs over. Set in oven to brown.      ~CODFISH HASH~--Take a cup of cooked cod, pick in pieces and soak in  cold water for twelve hours. Boil some potatoes and add them to the  finely chopped fish, a little at a time. Put in a saucepan with some  butter and stir. Let it cook gently.      ~FINNAN HADDIE FISH CAKES~--The finnan haddie parboiled with an equal  quantity of mashed potatoes, season with melted butter, salt and pepper,  add a beaten egg, and mold into cakes.      ~FISH, EAST INDIA STYLE~--Peel two medium-sized onions, cut into thin  slices. Put in a stewpan with a small lump of butter and fry until  lightly browned. Pour over them some white stock, judging the quantity  by that of the fish; one ounce of butter, little curry powder, salt,  lemon juice, a little sugar, and cayenne pepper. Boil the stock for  fifteen or twenty minutes, then strain into a stewpan, skim and put in  the fish, having it carefully prepared. Boil gently, without breaking  the fish. Wash and boil half a cup of rice in water, and when cooked it  should be dried and the grains unbroken. Turn the curry out on a hot  dish, garnish with croutons of fried bread. Serve hot, with the rice in  separate dish.      ~FISH EN CASSEROLE~--One of those earthen baking dishes with  close-fitting cover of the same ware and fit for placing on the table is  especially useful for cooking fish. For instance, take two pounds of the  thick part of cod or haddock, both of which are cheap fish. Take off  the skin and lay in the casserole. Make a sauce from two cups of milk  heated, with a good slice of onion, a rounding tablespoon of minced  parsley, a small piece of mace, a few gratings of the yellow rind of  lemon, half a level teaspoon of salt, and a little white pepper. Cook in  the top of a double boiler for twenty minutes. Heat one-quarter cup of  butter in a saucepan, add three level tablespoons of flour, and cook  smooth, turn on the hot milk after straining out the seasonings. Cook  until thick and pour over the fish. Cover and bake half hour, then if  the fish is done serve in the same dish with little finely minced  parsley scattered over.      ~LOUISIANA COD~--Melt one-quarter cup of butter and let it begin to  color, add two level tablespoons of flour and stir until smooth. Add one  cup of water and cook five minutes. Add half a level teaspoon of salt,  half as much pepper, and a teaspoon of lemon juice. Chop fine one  medium-size onion and one small green pepper, after taking out the  seeds. Brown them in two tablespoons of butter, add one cup of strained  tomatoes, a bit of bay leaf, and the prepared sauce. Put slices of cod  cut an inch thick into a casserole, pour on the sauce, cover closely,  and bake in a slow oven three-quarters of an hour.      ~METELOTE OF HADDOCK~--Wash and skin the haddock and remove the flesh  from the bones in firm pieces suitable for serving. Put the head, bones  and trimmings to cook in cold water and add a small sliced onion and  salt and pepper. Boil six good-sized onions until tender, then drain and  slice and put half of them into a buttered baking dish. Arrange the  pieces of fish on these, sprinkle with salt and pepper, then add the  remaining onions. Drain the fish from the trimmings, add to it two  tablespoons lemon juice and pour it over onions and fish. Cover very  closely and cook in the oven until the fish is tender. Then drain off  the liquid, heat it to the boiling point, and thicken it with two eggs  slightly beaten and diluted with a little of the hot liquid. Arrange the  onions on a hot platter and place the fish on top, then pour over the  thickened liquid.      ~A MOLD OF SALMON~--If where one cannot get fresh fish, the canned  salmon makes a delicious mold. Serve very cold on a bed of crisp lettuce  or cress. Drain off the juice from a can of salmon, and flake, picking  out every fragment of bone and skin. Mix with the fish one egg lightly  beaten, the juice of a half lemon, a cup fine dry bread crumbs, and salt  and pepper to season. Pack in a buttered mold which has a tight-fitting  "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18440"],[0,"Logic: Deductive and Inductive (#3)"],[1,"            369  Sec.2.

Logic is the science that explains what conditions must be  fulfilled in order that a proposition may be proved, if it admits of  proof. Not, indeed, every such proposition; for as to those that declare  the equality or inequality of numbers or other magnitudes, to explain  the conditions of their proof belongs to Mathematics: they are said to  be _quantitative_. But as to all other propositions, called  _qualitative_, like most of those that we meet with in conversation, in  literature, in politics, and even in sciences so far as they are not  treated mathematically (say, Botany and Psychology); propositions that  merely tell us that something happens (as that _salt dissolves in  water_), or that something has a certain property (as that _ice is  cold_): as to these, it belongs to Logic to show how we may judge  whether they are true, or false, or doubtful. When propositions are  expressed with the universality and definiteness that belong to  scientific statements, they are called laws; and laws, so far as they  are not laws of quantity, are tested by the principles of Logic, if they  at all admit of proof.    But it is plain that the process of proving cannot go on for ever;  something must be taken for granted; and this is usually considered to  be the case (1) with particular facts that can only be perceived and  observed, and (2) with those highest laws that are called 'axioms' or  'first principles,' of which we can only say that we know of no  exceptions to them, that we cannot help believing them, and that they  are indispensable to science and to consistent thought. Logic, then, may  be briefly defined as the science of proof with respect to _qualitative_  laws and propositions, except those that are axiomatic.    Sec. 2. Proof may be of different degrees or stages of completeness.  Absolute proof would require that a proposition should be shown to agree  with all experience and with the systematic explanation of experience,  to be a necessary part of an all-embracing and self-consistent  philosophy or theory of the universe; but as no one hitherto has been  able to frame such a philosophy, we must at present put up with  something less than absolute proof. Logic, assuming certain principles  to be true of experience, or at least to be conditions of consistent  discourse, distinguishes the kinds of propositions that can be shown to  agree with these principles, and explains by what means the agreement  can best be exhibited. Such principles are those of Contradiction (chap.  vi.), the Syllogism (chap. ix.), Causation (chap. xiv.), and  Probabilities (chap. xx.). To bring a proposition or an argument under  them, or to show that it agrees with them, is logical proof.    The extent to which proof is requisite, again, depends upon the present  purpose: if our aim be general truth for its own sake, a systematic  investigation is necessary; but if our object be merely to remove some  occasional doubt that has occurred to ourselves or to others, it may be  enough to appeal to any evidence that is admitted or not questioned.  Thus, if a man doubts that _some acids are compounds of oxygen_, but  grants that _some compounds of oxygen are acids_, he may agree to the  former proposition when you point out that it has the same meaning as  the latter, differing from it only in the order of the words. This is  called proof by immediate inference.    Again, suppose that a man holds in his hand a piece of yellow metal,  which he asserts to be copper, and that we doubt this, perhaps  suggesting that it is really gold. Then he may propose to dip it in  vinegar; whilst we agree that, if it then turns green, it is copper and  not gold. On trying this experiment the metal does turn green; so that  we may put his argument in this way:--        _Whatever yellow metal turns green in vinegar is copper;      This yellow metal turns green in vinegar;      Therefore, this yellow metal is copper._    Such an argument is called proof by mediate inference; because one  cannot see directly that the yellow metal is copper; but it is admitted  that any yellow metal is copper that turns green in vinegar, and we are  shown that this yellow metal has that property.    Now, however, it may occur to us, that the liquid in which the metal was  dipped was not vinegar, or not pure vinegar, and that the greenness was  due to the impurity. Our friend must thereupon show by some means that  the vinegar was pure; and then his argument will be that, since nothing  but the vinegar came in contact with the metal, the greenness was due to  the vinegar; or, in other words, that contact with that vinegar was the  cause of the metal turning green.    Still, on second thoughts, we may suspect that we had formerly conceded  too much; we may reflect that, although it had often been shown that  copper turned green in vinegar, whilst gold did not, yet the same might  not always happen. May it not be, we might ask, that just at this  moment, and perhaps always for the future gold turns, and will turn  green in vinegar, whilst copper does not and never will again? He will  probably reply that this is to doubt the uniformity of causation: he may  hope that we are not serious: he may point out to us that in every  action of our life we take such uniformity for granted. But he will be  obliged to admit that, whatever he may say to induce us to assent to the  principle of Nature's uniformity, his arguments will not amount to  logical proof, because every argument in some way assumes that  principle. He has come, in fact, to the limits of Logic. Just as Euclid  does not try to prove that 'two magnitudes equal to the same third are  equal to one another,' so the Logician (as such) does not attempt to  prove the uniformity of causation and the other principles of his  science.    Even when our purpose is to ascertain some general truth, the results of  systematic inquiry may have various degrees of certainty. If Logic were  confined to strict demonstration, it would cover a narrow field. The  greater part of our conclusions can only be more or less probable. It  may, indeed, be maintained, not unreasonably, that no judgments  concerning matters of fact can be more than probable. Some say that all  scientific results should be considered as giving the average of cases,  from which deviations are to be expected. Many matters can only be  treated statistically and by the methods of Probability. Our ordinary  beliefs are adopted without any methodical examination. But it is the  aim, and it is characteristic, of a rational mind to distinguish degrees  of certainty, and to hold each judgment with the degree of confidence  that it deserves, considering the evidence for and against it. It takes  a long time, and much self-discipline, to make some progress toward  rationality; for there are many causes of belief that are not good  grounds for it--have no value as evidence. Evidence consists of (1)  observation; (2) reasoning checked by observation and by logical  principles; (3) memory--often inaccurate; (4) testimony--often  untrustworthy, but indispensable, since all we learn from books or from  other men is taken on testimony; (5) the agreement of all our results.  On the other hand, belief is caused by many influences that are not  evidence at all: such are (1) desire, which makes us believe in whatever  serves our purpose; fear and suspicion, which (paradoxically) make us  believe in whatever seems dangerous; (2) habit, which resists whatever  disturbs our prejudices; (3) vanity, which delights to think oneself  always right and consistent and disowns fallibility; (4) imitativeness,  suggestibility, fashion, which carry us along with the crowd. All these,  and nobler things, such as love and fidelity, fix our attention upon  whatever seems to support our prejudices, and prevent our attending to  any facts or arguments that threaten to overthrow them.    Sec. 3. Two departments of Logic are usually recognised, Deduction and  Induction; that is, to describe them briefly, proof from principles, and  proof from facts. Classification is sometimes made a third department;  sometimes its topics are distributed amongst those of the former two. In  the present work the order adopted is, Deduction in chaps. ii. to xiii.;  Induction in chaps. xiii. to xx.; and, lastly, Classification. But such  divisions do not represent fundamentally distinct and opposed aspects of  the science. For although, in discussing any question with an opponent  who makes admissions, it may be possible to combat his views with merely  "]]]
