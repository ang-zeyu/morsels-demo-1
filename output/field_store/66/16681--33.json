[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20638"],[0,"From Plotzk to Boston (#3)"],[1,"emigrants were aided by men who made it their  profession to help them cross, often suffering themselves to be paid  such sums for the service that it paid best to be provided with a  special passport.    As I said, the difficulties were greater at the time we were travelling,  and our friends believed we had better not attempt a stealthy crossing,  and we procured the necessary document to facilitate it. We therefore  expected little trouble, but some we thought there might be, for we had  heard some vague rumors to the effect that a special passport was not as  powerful an agent as it used to be.    We now prepared to enjoy a little lunch, and before we had time to clear  it away the train stopped, and we saw several men in blue uniforms, gilt  buttons and brass helmets, if you may call them so, on their heads. At  his side each wore a kind of leather case attached to a wide bronze  belt. In these cases they carried something like a revolver, and each  had, besides, a little book with black oilcloth covers.    I can give you no idea of the impression these men (they were German  gendarmes) made on us, by saying they frightened us. Perhaps because  their (to us) impressive appearance gave them a stern look; perhaps  because they really looked something more than grave, we were so  frightened. I only know that we were. I can see the reason now clearly  enough. Like all persons who were used to the tyranny of a Russian  policeman, who practically ruled the ward or town under his friendly  protection, and never hesitated to assert his rights as holder of  unlimited authority over his little domain, in that mild, amiable manner  so well known to such of his subjects as he particularly favored with  his vigilant regard--like all such persons, I say, we did not, could  not, expect to receive any kind treatment at the hands of a number of  officers, especially as we were in the very act of attempting to part  with our much-beloved mother country, of which act, to judge by the  pains it took to make it difficult, the government did not approve. It  was a natural fear in us, as you can easily see. Pretty soon mother  recovered herself, and remembering that the train stops for a few  minutes only, was beginning to put away the scattered articles hastily  when a gendarme entered our car and said we were not to leave it. Mamma  asked him why, but he said nothing and left the car, another gendarme  entering as he did so. He demanded where we were going, and, hearing the  answer, went out. Before we had had time to look about at each other's  frightened faces, another man, a doctor, as we soon knew, came in  followed by a third gendarme.    The doctor asked many questions about our health, and of what  nationality we were. Then he asked about various things, as where we  were going to, if we had tickets, how much money we had, where we came  from, to whom we were going, etc., etc., making a note of every answer  he received. This done, he shook his head with his shining helmet on it,  and said slowly (I imagined he enjoyed frightening us), \"With these  third class tickets you cannot go to America now, because it is  forbidden to admit emigrants into Germany who have not at least second  class tickets. You will have to return to Russia unless you pay at the  office here to have your tickets changed for second class ones.\" After a  few minutes' calculation and reference to the notes he had made, he  added calmly, \"I find you will need two hundred rubles to get your  tickets exchanged;\" and, as the finishing stroke to his pleasing  communication, added, \"Your passports are of no use at all now because  the necessary part has to be torn out, whether you are allowed to pass  or not.\" A plain, short speech he made of it, that cruel man. Yet every  word sounded in our ears with an awful sound that stopped the beating of  our hearts for a while--sounded like the ringing of funeral bells to us,  and yet without the mournfully sweet music those bells make, that they  might heal while they hurt.    We were homeless, houseless, and friendless in a strange place. We had  hardly money enough to last us through the voyage for which we had hoped  and waited for three long years. We had suffered much that the reunion  we longed for might come about; we had prepared ourselves to suffer more  in order to bring it about, and had parted with those we loved, with  places that were dear to us in spite of what we passed through in them,  never again to see them, as we were convinced--all for the same dear  end. With strong hopes and high spirits that hid the sad parting, we had  started on our long journey. And now we were checked so unexpectedly  but surely, the blow coming from where we little expected it, being, as  we believed, safe in that quarter. And that is why the simple words had  such a frightful meaning to us. We had received a wound we knew not how  to heal.    When mother had recovered enough to speak she began to argue with the  gendarme, telling him our story and begging him to be kind. The children  were frightened by what they understood, and all but cried. I was only  wondering what would happen, and wishing I could pour out my grief in  tears, as the others did; but when I feel deeply I seldom show it in  that way, and always wish I could.    Mother's supplications, and perhaps the children's indirect ones, had  more effect than I supposed they would. The officer was moved, even if  he had just said that tears would not be accepted instead of money, and  gave us such kind advice that I began to be sorry I had thought him  cruel, for it was easy to see that he was only doing his duty and had no  part in our trouble that he could be blamed for, now that I had more  kindly thoughts of him.    He said that we would now be taken to Keebart, a few versts' distance  from Verzbolovo, where one Herr Schidorsky lived. This man, he said, was  well known for miles around, and we were to tell him our story and ask  him to help us, which he probably would, being very kind.    A ray of hope shone on each of the frightened faces listening so  attentively to this bearer of both evil and happy tidings. I, for one,  was very confident that the good man would help us through our  difficulties, for I was most unwilling to believe that we really  couldn't continue our journey. Which of us was? I'd like to know.    We are in Keebart, at the depot. The least important particular even of  that place, I noticed and remembered. How the porter--he was an ugly,  grinning man--carried in our things and put them away in the southern  corner of the big room, on the floor; how we sat down on a settee near  them, a yellow settee; how the glass roof let in so much light that we  had to shade our eyes because the car had been dark and we had been  crying; how there were only a few people besides ourselves there, and  how I began to count them and stopped when I noticed a sign over the  head of the fifth person--a little woman with a red nose and a pimple on  it, that seemed to be staring at me as much as the grayish-blue eyes  above them, it was so large and round--and tried to read the German,  with the aid of the Russian translation below. I noticed all this and  remembered it, as if there was nothing else in the world for me to think  of--no America, no gendarme to destroy one's passports and speak of two  hundred rubles as if he were a millionaire, no possibility of being sent  back to one's old home whether one felt at all grateful for the  kindness or not--nothing but that most attractive of places, full of  interesting sights.    For, though I had been so hopeful a little while ago, I felt quite  discouraged when a man, very sour and grumbling--and he was a Jew--a  \"Son of Mercy\" as a certain song said--refused to tell mamma where  Schidorsky lived. I then believed that the whole world must have united  against us; and decided to show my defiant indifference by leaving the  world to be as unkind as it pleased, while I took no interest in such  trifles.    So I let my mind lose itself in a queer sort of mist--a something I  cannot describe except by saying it must have been made up of lazy  inactivity. Through this mist I saw and heard indistinctly much that  followed.    When I think of it now, I see how selfish it was to allow myself to  sink, body and mind, in such a sea of helpless laziness, when I might  have done something besides awaiting the end of that critical time,  whatever it might be--something, though what, I do not see even now, I  own. But I only studied the many notices till I thought myself very well  acquainted with the German tongue; and now and then tried to cheer the  other children, who were still inclined to cry, by pointing out to them  some of the things that interested me. For this faulty conduct I have no  excuse to give, unless youth and the fact that I was stunned with the  shock we had just received, will be accepted.    I remember through that mist that mother found Schidorsky's home at  last, but was told she could not see him till a little later; that she  came back to comfort us, and found there our former fellow passenger who  had come with us from Vilna, and that he was very indignant at the way  in which we were treated, and scolded, and declared he would have the  matter in all the papers, and said we must be helped. I remember how  mamma saw Schidorsky at last, spoke to him, and then told us, word for  word, what his answer had been; that he wouldn't wait to be asked to use  all his influence, and wouldn't lose a moment about it, and he didn't,  for he went out at once on that errand, while his good daughter did her  best to comfort mamma with kind words and tea. I remember that there was  much going to the good man's house; much hurrying of special messengers  to and from Eidtkunen; trembling inquiries, uncertain replies made  hopeful only by the pitying, encouraging words and manners of the  deliverer--for"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2064"],[0,"A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland (#3)"],[1,"incidents of life.    The knowledge of one professor soon procured me the notice of the rest,  and I did not want any token of regard, being conducted wherever there  was any thing which I desired to see, and entertained at once with the  novelty of the place, and the kindness of communication.    To write of the cities of our own island with the solemnity of  geographical description, as if we had been cast upon a newly discovered  coast, has the appearance of very frivolous ostentation; yet as Scotland  is little known to the greater part of those who may read these  observations, it is not superfluous to relate, that under the name of  Aberdeen are comprised two towns standing about a mile distant from each  other, but governed, I think, by the same magistrates.    Old Aberdeen is the ancient episcopal city, in which are still to be seen  the remains of the cathedral.  It has the appearance of a town in decay,  having been situated in times when commerce was yet unstudied, with very  little attention to the commodities of the harbour.    New Aberdeen has all the bustle of prosperous trade, and all the shew of  increasing opulence.  It is built by the water-side.  The houses are  large and lofty, and the streets spacious and clean.  They build almost  wholly with the granite used in the new pavement of the streets of  London, which is well known not to want hardness, yet they shape it  easily.  It is beautiful and must be very lasting.    What particular parts of commerce are chiefly exercised by the merchants  of Aberdeen, I have not inquired.  The manufacture which forces itself  upon a stranger's eye is that of knit-stockings, on which the women of  the lower class are visibly employed.    In each of these towns there is a college, or in stricter language, an  university; for in both there are professors of the same parts of  learning, and the colleges hold their sessions and confer degrees  separately, with total independence of one on the other.    In old Aberdeen stands the King's College, of which the first president  was Hector Boece, or Boethius, who may be justly reverenced as one of the  revivers of elegant learning.  When he studied at Paris, he was  acquainted with Erasmus, who afterwards gave him a public testimony of  his esteem, by inscribing to him a catalogue of his works.  The stile of  Boethius, though, perhaps, not always rigorously pure, is formed with  great diligence upon ancient models, and wholly uninfected with monastic  barbarity.  His history is written with elegance and vigour, but his  fabulousness and credulity are justly blamed.  His fabulousness, if he  was the author of the fictions, is a fault for which no apology can be  made; but his credulity may be excused in an age, when all men were  credulous.  Learning was then rising on the world; but ages so long  accustomed to darkness, were too much dazzled with its light to see any  thing distinctly.  The first race of scholars, in the fifteenth century,  and some time after, were, for the most part, learning to speak, rather  than to think, and were therefore more studious of elegance than of  truth.  The contemporaries of Boethius thought it sufficient to know what  the ancients had delivered.  The examination of tenets and of facts was  reserved for another generation.    * * * * *    Boethius, as president of the university, enjoyed a revenue of forty  Scottish marks, about two pounds four shillings and sixpence of sterling  money.  In the present age of trade and taxes, it is difficult even for  the imagination so to raise the value of money, or so to diminish the  demands of life, as to suppose four and forty shillings a year, an  honourable stipend; yet it was probably equal, not only to the needs, but  to the rank of Boethius.  The wealth of England was undoubtedly to that  of Scotland more than five to one, and it is known that Henry the eighth,  among whose faults avarice was never reckoned, granted to Roger Ascham,  as a reward of his learning, a pension of ten pounds a year.    The other, called the Marischal College, is in the new town.  The hall is  large and well lighted.  One of its ornaments is the picture of Arthur  Johnston, who was principal of the college, and who holds among the Latin  poets of Scotland the next place to the elegant Buchanan.    In the library I was shewn some curiosities; a Hebrew manuscript of  exquisite penmanship, and a Latin translation of Aristotle's Politicks by  Leonardus Aretinus, written in the Roman character with nicety and  beauty, which, as the art of printing has made them no longer necessary,  are not now to be found.  This was one of the latest performances of the  transcribers, for Aretinus died but about twenty years before typography  was invented.  This version has been printed, and may be found in  libraries, but is little read; for the same books have been since  translated both by Victorius and Lambinus, who lived in an age more  cultivated, but perhaps owed in part to Aretinus that they were able to  excel him.  Much is due to those who first broke the way to knowledge,  and left only to their successors the task of smoothing it.    In both these colleges the methods of instruction are nearly the same;  the lectures differing only by the accidental difference of diligence, or  ability in the professors.  The students wear scarlet gowns and the  professors black, which is, I believe, the academical dress in all the  Scottish universities, except that of Edinburgh, where the scholars are  not distinguished by any particular habit.  In the King's College there  is kept a public table, but the scholars of the Marischal College are  boarded in the town.  The expence of living is here, according to the  information that I could obtain, somewhat more than at St. Andrews.    The course of education is extended to four years, at the end of which  those who take a degree, who are not many, become masters of arts, and  whoever is a master may, if he pleases, immediately commence doctor.  The  title of doctor, however, was for a considerable time bestowed only on  physicians.  The advocates are examined and approved by their own body;  the ministers were not ambitious of titles, or were afraid of being  censured for ambition; and the doctorate in every faculty was commonly  given or sold into other countries.  The ministers are now reconciled to  distinction, and as it must always happen that some will excel others,  have thought graduation a proper testimony of uncommon abilities or  acquisitions.    The indiscriminate collation of degrees has justly taken away that  respect which they originally claimed as stamps, by which the literary  value of men so distinguished was authoritatively denoted.  That  academical honours, or any others should be conferred with exact  proportion to merit, is more than human judgment or human integrity have  given reason to expect.  Perhaps degrees in universities cannot be better  adjusted by any general rule than by the length of time passed in the  public profession of learning.  An English or Irish doctorate cannot be  obtained by a very young man, and it is reasonable to suppose, what is  likewise by experience commonly found true, that he who is by age  qualified to be a doctor, has in so much time gained learning sufficient  not to disgrace the title, or wit sufficient not to desire it.    The Scotch universities hold but one term or session in the year.  That  of St. Andrews continues eight months, that of Aberdeen only five, from  the first of November to the first of April.    In Aberdeen there is an English Chapel, in which the congregation was  numerous and splendid.  The form of public worship used by the church of  England is in Scotland legally practised in licensed chapels served by  clergymen of English or Irish ordination, and by tacit connivance quietly  permitted in separate congregations supplied with ministers by the  successors of the bishops who were deprived at the Revolution.    We came to Aberdeen on Saturday August 21.  On Monday we were invited  into the town-hall, where I had the freedom of the city given me by the  Lord Provost.  The honour conferred had all the decorations that  politeness could add, and what I am afraid I should not have had to say  of any city south of the Tweed, I found no petty officer bowing for a  fee.    The parchment containing the record of admission is, with the seal  appending, fastened to a riband and worn for one day by the new citizen  in his hat.    By a lady who saw us at the chapel, the Earl of Errol was informed of our  arrival, and we had the honour of an invitation to his seat, called  Slanes Castle, as I am told, improperly, from the castle of that name,  which once stood at a place not far distant.    The road beyond Aberdeen grew more stony, and continued equally naked of  all vegetable decoration.  We travelled over a tract of ground near the  sea, which, not long ago, suffered a very uncommon, and unexpected  calamity.  The sand of the shore was raised by a tempest in such  quantities, and carried to such a distance, that an estate was  overwhelmed and lost.  Such and so hopeless was the barrenness  superinduced, that the owner, when he was required to pay the usual tax,  desired rather to resign the ground.          SLANES CASTLE, THE BULLER OF BUCHAN      We came in the afternoon to Slanes Castle, built upon the margin of the  sea, so that the walls of one of the towers seem only a continuation of a  perpendicular rock, the foot of which is beaten by the waves.  To walk  round the house seemed impracticable.  From the windows the eye wanders  over the sea that separates Scotland from Norway, and when the winds beat  with violence must enjoy all the terrifick grandeur of the tempestuous  ocean.  I would not for my amusement wish for a storm; but as storms,  whether wished or not, will sometimes happen, I may say, without  violation of humanity, that I should"]]]
