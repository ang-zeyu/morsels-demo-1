From Ichang to Chungking--a distance of 412 miles--the river Yangtse, in  a great part of its course, is a series of rapids which no steamer has  yet attempted to ascend, though it is contended that the difficulties of  navigation would not be insuperable to a specially constructed steamer  of elevated horse-power. Some idea of the speed of the current at this  part of the river may be given by the fact that a junk, taking thirty to  thirty-five days to do the upward journey, hauled most of the way by  gangs of trackers, has been known to do the down-river journey in two  days and a half.    Believing that I could thus save some days on the journey, I decided to  go to Chungking on foot, and engaged a coolie to accompany me. We were  to start on the Thursday afternoon; but about midnight on Wednesday I  met Dr. Aldridge, of the Customs, who easily persuaded me that by taking  the risk of going in a small boat (a _wupan_), and not in an ordinary  passenger junk (a _kwatze_), I might, with luck, reach Chungking as soon  by water as I could reach Wanhsien at half the distance by land. The  Doctor was a man of surprising energy. He offered to arrange everything  for me, and by 6 o'clock in the morning he had engaged a boat, had  selected a captain (_laoban_), and a picked crew of four young men, who  undertook to land me in Chungking in fifteen days, and had given them  all necessary instructions for my journey. All was to be ready for a  start the same evening.    During the course of the morning the written agreement was brought me by  the laoban, drawn up in Chinese and duly signed, of which a Chinese  clerk made me the following translation into English. I transcribe it  literally:--    Yang Hsing Chung (the laoban) hereby contracts to convey Dr. M. to  Chungking on the following conditions:--         1. The passage-money agreed upon is 28,000 cash (_L2 16s._),       which includes all charges.         2. If Chungking is reached in twelve days, Dr. M. will give       the master 32,500 cash instead; if in thirteen days 31,000,       and if in fifteen days 28,000.         3. If all goes well and the master does his duty       satisfactorily, Dr. M. will give him 30,000 cash, even if he       gets to Chungking in fifteen days.         4. The sum of 14,000 cash is to be advanced to the master       before starting; the remainder to be paid on arrival at       Chungking.                   (Signed)     YANG HSING CHUNG.      Dated the 17th day of the 2nd moon,            K, shui 20th year.    The Chinaman who wrote this in English speaks English better than many  Englishmen.          CHAPTER II.    FROM ICHANG TO WANHSIEN, WITH SOME ACCOUNT OF CHINESE WOMEN AND THE  RAPIDS OF THE YANGTSE KIANG.      The agreement was brought me in the morning; all the afternoon I was  busy, and at 8 p.m. I embarked from the Customs pontoon. The boat was a  wupan (five boards), 28 feet long and drawing 8 inches. Its sail was  like the wing of a butterfly, with transverse ribs of light bamboo; its  stern was shaped \"like a swallow's wings at rest.\" An improvised  covering of mats amidships was my crib; and with spare mats, slipt  during the day over the boat's hood, coverings could be made at night  for'ard for my three men and aft for the other two. It seemed a frail  little craft to face the dangers of the cataracts, but it was manned by  as smart a crew of young Chinese as could be found on the river. It was  pitch dark when we paddled into the stream amidst a discharge of  crackers. As we passed under the _Kweili_, men were there to wish me  _bon voyage_, and a revolver was emptied into the darkness to propitiate  the river god.    We paddled up the bank under the sterns of countless junks, past the  walled city, and then, crossing to the other bank, we made fast and  waited for the morning to begin our journey. The lights of the city were  down the river; all was quiet; my men were in good heart, and there was  no doubt whatever that they would make every effort to fulfil their  contract.    At daylight we were away again and soon entered the first of the great  gorges where the river has cleft its way through the mountains.    With a clear and sunny sky, the river flowing smoothly and reflecting  deeply the lofty and rugged hills which fall steeply to the water's  edge, a light boat, and a model crew, it was a pleasure to lie at ease  wrapped in my Chinese pukai and watch the many junks lazily falling down  the river, the largest of them \"dwarfed by the colossal dimensions of  the surrounding scenery to the size of sampans,\" and the fishing boats,  noiseless but for the gentle creaking of the sheers and dip-net,  silently working in the still waters under the bank.    At Ping-shan-pa there is an outstation of the Imperial Maritime Customs  in charge of a seafaring man who was once a cockatoo farmer in South  Australia, and drove the first team of bullocks to the Mount Brown  diggings. He lives comfortably in a house-boat moored to the bank. He is  one of the few Englishmen in China married in the English way, as  distinct from the Chinese, to a Chinese girl. His wife is one of the  prettiest girls that ever came out of Nanking, and talks English  delightfully with a musical voice that is pleasant to listen to. I  confess that I am one of those who agree with the missionary writer in  regarding \"the smile of a Chinese woman as inexpressibly charming.\" I  have seen girls in China who would be considered beautiful in any  capital in Europe. The attractiveness of the Japanese lady has been the  theme of many writers, but, speaking as an impartial observer who has  been both in Japan and China, I have never been able to come to any  other decision than that in every feature the Chinese woman is superior  to her Japanese sister. She is head and shoulders above the Japanese;  she is more intellectual, or, rather, she is more capable of  intellectual development; she is incomparably more chaste and modest.  She is prettier, sweeter, and more trustworthy than the misshapen  cackling little dot with black teeth that we are asked to admire as a  Japanese beauty. The traveller in China is early impressed by the  contrast between the almost entire freedom from apparent immorality of  the Chinese cities, especially of Western China, and the flaunting  indecency of the _Yoshiwaras_ of Japan, with \"their teeming, seething,  busy mass of women, whose virtue is industry and whose industry is  vice.\"    The small feet of the Chinese women, though admired by the Chinese and  poetically referred to by them as \"three-inch gold lilies,\" are in our  eyes a very unpleasant deformity--but still, even with this deformity,  the walk of the Chinese woman is more comely than the gait of the  Japanese woman as she shambles ungracefully along with her little bent  legs, scraping her wooden-soled slippers along the pavement with a noise  that sets your teeth on edge. \"Girls are like flowers,\" say the Chinese,  \"like the willow. It is very important that their feet should be bound  short so that they can walk beautifully with mincing steps, swaying  gracefully, and thus showing to all that they are persons of  respectability.\" Apart from the Manchus, the dominant race, whose women  do not bind their feet, all chaste Chinese girls have small feet. Those  who have large feet are either, speaking generally, ladies of easy  virtue or slave girls. And, of course, no Christian girl is allowed to  have her feet bound.    [Illustration: ON A BALCONY IN WESTERN CHINA.]    Leaving Ping-shan-pa with a stiff breeze in our favour we slowly stemmed  the current. Look at the current side, and you would think we were doing  eight knots an hour or more, but look at the shore side, close to which  we kept to escape as far as possible from the current, and you saw how  gradually we felt our way along.    At a double row of mat sheds filled with huge coils of bamboo rope of  all thicknesses, my laoban went ashore to purchase a towline; he took  with him 1000 cash (about two shillings), and returned with a coil 100  yards in length and 600 cash of change. The rope he brought was made of  plaited bamboo, was as thick as the middle finger, and as tough as  whalebone.    The country was more open and terraced everywhere into gardens. Our  progress was most satisfactory. When night came we drew into the bank,  and I coiled up in my crib and made myself comfortable. Space was  cramped, and I had barely room to stretch my legs. My cabin was 5 feet 6  inches square and 4 feet high, open behind, but with two little doors in  front, out of which I could just manage to squeeze myself sideways round  the mast. Coir matting was next the floor boards, then a thick Chinese  quilt (a _pukai_), then a Scotch plaid made in Geelong. My pillow was  Chinese, and the hardest part of the bed; my portmanteau was beside me  and served as a desk; a Chinese candle, more wick than wax, stuck into a  turnip, gave me light.    This, our first day's journey, brought us to within sound of the worst  rapid on the river, the Hsintan, and the roar of the cataract hummed in  our ears all night.    Early in the morning we were at the foot of the rapid under the bank on  the opposite side of the river from the town of Hsintan. It was an  exciting scene. A swirling torrent with a roar like thunder was frothing  down the cataract. Above, barriers of rocks athwart the stream stretched  like a weir across the river, damming the deep still water behind it.  The shore was strewn with boulders. Groups of trackers were on the bank  squatting on the rocks to see the foreign devil and his cockleshell.  Other Chinese were standing where the side-stream is split by the  boulders into narrow races, catching fish with great dexterity, dipping  them out of the water with scoop-nets.    We rested in some smooth water under shelter and put out our towline;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19180"],[0,"Scientific  American, Volume XXIV., No. 12,  March 18, 1871 (#3)"],[1,"end of the thumb up  to the first joint. It is then pressed with the hand, so as to fit  and take the shape of the thumb and nail. This cannot be done at one  heating, but will have to be put into the hot water again, and the end  pinched and squeezed into form to the shape of the nail, and to fit  easily upon the thumb. When this gets hard, it may be trimmed into  perfect form with a penknife. This artificial nail will answer the  purpose admirably if properly made; and even when the natural nail  is good, the gutta-percha will serve to save it from injury. Good  figuring may also be done by using the blank end of the steel  comb with a rag folded over its edge. We have also used a piece of  gutta-percha to take out the lights. This should be square-ended,  about one inch wide, and three or four inches long, and will do  successful work of a certain class, but not of the best. Many grainers  use a piece of thin horn, in shape something like a spatula, about  three or four inches long and three quarters of an inch wide, with  rounded ends, and quite flexible. With this tool the figure is cut  or scooped out--a sort of quick, side-long motion, very difficult to  describe, and requiring a very considerable amount of practice  before it can be worked with any success. There is, however, the same  objection to this tool as may be urged against the gutta-percha for  figuring, namely, that neither of them take the color clean away, but  leave an accumulation of color on the edge of the figure, which is  fatal to good work; and therefore we cannot honestly recommend the  use of any method but the wiping out with the thumb-nail or its  substitute. When the figure is wiped out it will require to be  softened. By softening, we mean the imitation of those half shades  seen upon and about the figures in the real wood. Between and around  the lights or figure in oak, there is always a lighter tint of color;  this is imitated by doubling a piece of rag into a small roll, and  with the side of this the grain is partially wiped away, but not to  the extent of taking off the whole of the grain. A recent but most  admirable system of graining oak, by means of over-combing, is worked  exactly the reverse of any of the foregoing methods; that is to  say, the figure is first wiped out, and the combing or grain is done  afterwards, when the graining color is dry, in this wise: The graining  color is mixed somewhat thinner than for ordinary graining, and is  brushed over the work sparingly, leaving it just sufficiently strong  to show a clear distinction between the ground and the color. The  light or figure is then softened by drawing the end of a flat hog-hair  fitch, or a small thin mottler, across each figure, and slightly  softening with the badger-hair softener. The figure is broken up a  little with fine lines across it in parts, such as may be seen in the  real wood; but previous to wiping out the figure, streaks of light  should be wiped out and softened on one side of the panel or across  the stiles, in imitation of the reflective lights seen in oak. The  color should also be partially wiped off the rails or stiles at their  junction; this tends to define the joint. The color is now let to  dry hard, when it will be ready for over-combing--that is, combing or  graining over the figure (hence its name), and this will have to be  done somewhat differently to the ordinary combing. As thus: The color  is rubbed in as before, and combed solely with the gutta-percha combs,  but these are specially cut for the purpose; they are best about 2 in.  wide. The first must be cut with teeth about three-sixteenths of an  inch in width, the next one-eighth, and the third about one-sixteenth.  The broad-toothed comb is first used, and must be drawn down the  panel, with a wavy motion, in short or long curls; either will  answer our purpose now. The next size of comb is then drawn straight  down--the straighter the better. This has the effect of breaking the  wavy combing into short and long straight bits, similar to the pores  or grain of the real wood. Both the first and second combing may be  varied by holding the comb in a slanting direction, and may be fine or  coarse, according to the width of the combs used; now take a soft rag  folded, and with this partially clear off the grain which runs over  the figure, leaving only a sufficient quantity crossing the light  or figure, to be just distinguished, exactly as it appears upon the  figure in real oak. The grain is also wiped off in parts on the plain  spaces between the figure, in order to break it up and take away any  formality. If this method be well and probably done, a thoroughly  deceptive imitation may be produced; and except this end be kept in  view, no really good work will result.           *       *       *       *       *          KNOTS AND SPLICES.      [_SEE ENGRAVING ON FIRST PAGE._]    1. Turn used in making up ropes.    2. End tapered for the purpose of passing it readily through a loop.  To make this, we unlay the rope for the necessary length, reducing  a rope diminishing in diameter towards the end, which is finished  by interlacing the ends without cutting them, as it would weaken the  work; it is lastly \"whipped\" with small twine.    3. Tapered end, covered with interlaced cordage for the purpose of  making it stronger. This is done with very small twine attached at  one end to the small eye, and at the other to the strands of the rope,  thus making a strong \"webbing\" around the end.    4. Double turn used for making rope.    5. Eye splice. The strands of the cable are brought back over  themselves, and interlaced with their original turns, as in a splice.    6. Tie for the end of a four-strand rope.    7. The same completed; the strands are tied together, forming loops,  laying one over the other.    8. Commencement for making the end by interlacing the strands.    9. Interlacing complete, but not fastened.    10 and 11. Shell in two views used in No. 65, showing the disposition  of it at the throat. This joining is advantageous, as it does not  strain the cords, and it prevents them from cutting each other; so  that the rings pass one into the other and are joined outside the  intermediate shell.    12. Interlacing in two directions.    13. Mode of finishing the end by several turns of the twine continued  over the cable.    14. Interlacing commenced, in one direction.    15. Interlacing finished, the ends being worked under the strands, as  in a splice.    16. Pigtail commenced.    17. Interlacing fastened.    18. Pigtail with the strands taut.    19. Dead eye, shown in two views.    20. Pigtail finished. We pass the ends of the strands, one under the  other, in the same way as if we were making a pudding splice: thus  bringing it in a line with the rope, to which it is seized fast, and  the ends cut off.    21. Scull pigtail; instead of holding the ends by a tie, we interlace  them again, as in No. 16, the one under the other.    22. Pigtail, or \"lark's nest.\" We make this to the \"pennant\" of a  cable, which has several strands, by taking the requisite number of  turns over the pudding, in such a manner that the strands shall lay  under each other. This \"pigtail\" forms a knot at the end of the  rope. It thus draws together two ropes, as shown in No. 32, forming a  \"shroud\" knot. In these two pigtails, the strands are crossed before  finishing the ends, so that the button, a, is made with the strands,  a, and b, with those of the rope, b.    23. Slip clinch to sailors' knot.    24. Slip clinch, secured.    25. Ordinary knot upon a double rope.    26. Bowline knot for a man to sit in at his work.    27. Called a \"short splice,\" as it is not of great length, and  besides, can be made quickly.    30. Long splice. This extends from a to b. We unlay the strands of  each of the ropes we intend to join, for about half the length that  the splice will be, putting each strand of the one between two strands  of the other.    31. Simple fastening on a rope.    32. A \"shroud\" knot.    33. The ends of the rope are prepared for making the splice (No.  29) in the same manner as for the \"shroud\" knot in No. 32. When the  strands are untwisted, we put the ends of two cords together as close  as possible, and place the ends of the one between the strands of the  other, above and below alternately, so as to interlace them as in No.  29. This splice is not, however, very strong, and is only used when  there is not time to make a long splice, which is much the best.    34 and 35. Marline spikes. Tools made of wood or iron, used to open  out a rope to pass the strands of another through it.    36. Shows strands arranged as described in No. 30.    37. Fastening when a lever is used, and is employed when hauling upon  large ropes, where the strength of several men are necessary.    38. A \"pudding splice.\" This is commenced, like the others, by placing  the rope end to end, the turns of the one being passed between those  of the other; having first swelled out the yarns by a \"rat's-tail,\" we  put them, two by two, one over the other, twisting them tightly, and  opening a way for them with the marlinspike. The inconvenience of this  splice is, that it is larger in diameter than the rope itself; but  when made sufficiently long, by gradually reducing the size of the  strands, it has great strength.    39. This shows two strands, a and b, of the ropes, A B, knotted  together, being drawn as tight as possible; we unlay the strand,  a', of the rope, A, for half the length of the splice, and twist the  strand, b', of the rope, B, strongly in its place, tying a' and b'  together tightly. The same process is again gone through on the rope,  B, the strand, a\", of the rope, A, being knotted to the strand, b\",  of the rope, B. When all the strands are thus knotted together, we  interlace them with the strands of the cable. Thus the strands, a a'  a\", are interlocked by being passed"]]]
