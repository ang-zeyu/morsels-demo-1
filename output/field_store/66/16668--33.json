Cheri again set out, and after some trouble learnt that this bird was  to be found on the top of a frightful rock, in a frozen climate. At  length, at dawn of day, he perceived the rock, which was very high and  very steep, and upon the summit of it was the bird, speaking like an  oracle, telling wonderful things. He thought that with a little  dexterity it would be easy to catch it, for it seemed very tame. He  got off his horse, and climbed up very quietly. He was so close to the  green bird that he thought he could lay hands on it, when suddenly the  rock opened and he fell into a spacious hall, and became as motionless  as a statue; he could neither stir, nor utter a complaint at his  deplorable situation. Three hundred knights, who had made the same  attempt, were in the same state. To look at each other was the only  thing permitted them.    The time seemed so long to Belle-Etoile, and still no signs of her  beloved Cheri, that she fell dangerously ill; and in the hopes of  curing her, Petit-Soleil resolved to seek him.    [Illustration]    But he too was swallowed up by the rock and fell into the great hall.  The first person he saw was Cheri, but he could not speak to him; and  Prince Heureux, following soon after, met with the same fate as the  other two.    When Feintise was aware that the third Prince was gone, she was  exceedingly delighted at the success of her plan; and when Belle-Etoile,  inconsolable at finding not one of her brothers return, reproached  herself for their loss, and resolved to follow them, she was quite  overjoyed.    The Princess was disguised as a cavalier, but had no other armour than  her helmet. She was dreadfully cold as she drew near the rock, but  seeing a turtle-dove lying on the snow, she took it up, warmed it, and  restored it to life: and the dove reviving, gaily said, \"I know you, in  spite of your disguise; follow my advice: when you arrive at the rock,  remain at the bottom and begin to sing the sweetest song you know; the  green bird will listen to you; you must then pretend to go to sleep;  when it sees me, it will come down to peck me, and at that moment you  will be able to seize it.\"    All this fell out as the Dove foretold. The green bird begged for  liberty. \"First,\" said Belle-Etoile, \"I wish that thou wouldst restore  my three brothers to me.\"    \"Under my left wing there is a red feather,\" said the bird: \"pull it  out, and touch the rock with it.\"    The Princess hastened to do as she was instructed; the rock split from  the top to the bottom: she entered with a victorious air the hall in  which stood the three Princes with many others; she ran towards Cheri,  who did not know her in her helmet and male attire, and could neither  speak nor move. The green bird then told the Princess she must rub the  eyes and mouth of all those she wished to disenchant with the red  feather, which good office she did to all.    The three Princes and Belle-Etoile hastened to present themselves to  the King; and when Belle-Etoile showed her treasures, the little green  bird told him that the Princes Petit-Soleil and Heureux and the  Princess Belle-Etoile were his children, and that Prince Cheri was his  nephew. Queen Blondine, who had mourned for them all these years,  embraced them, and the wicked Queen-Mother and old Feintise were  justly punished. And the King, who thought his nephew Cheri the  handsomest man at Court, consented to his marriage with Belle-Etoile.  And lastly, to make everyone happy, the King sent for the Corsair and  his wife, who gladly came.    [Illustration]          ALADDIN,    AND THE WONDERFUL LAMP.      Aladdin was the son of a poor tailor in an Eastern city. He was a  spoiled boy, and loved play better than work; so that when Mustapha,  his father, died, he was not able to earn his living; and his poor  mother had to spin cotton all day long to procure food for their  support. But she dearly loved her son, knowing that he had a good  heart, and she believed that as he grew older he would do better, and  become at last a worthy and prosperous man. One day, when Aladdin was  walking outside the town, an old man came up to him, and looking very  hard in his face, said he was his father's brother, and had long been  away in a distant country, but that now he wished to help his nephew  to get on. He then put a ring on the boy's finger, telling him that no  harm could happen to him so long as he wore it. Now, this strange man  was no uncle of Aladdin, nor was he related at all to him; but he  was a wicked magician, who wanted to make use of the lad's services,  as we shall see presently.    [Illustration]    The old man led Aladdin a good way into the country, until they came to  a very lonely spot between two lofty black mountains. Here he lighted a  fire, and threw into it some gum, all the time repeating many strange  words. The ground then opened just before them, and a stone trap-door  appeared. After lifting this up, the Magician told Aladdin to go below,  down some broken steps, and at the foot of these he would find three  halls, in the last of which was a door leading to a garden full of  beautiful trees; this he was to cross, and after mounting some more  steps, he would come to a terrace, when he would see a niche, in which  there was a lighted Lamp. He was then to take the Lamp, put out the  light, empty the oil, and bring it away with him.    [Illustration]    Aladdin found all the Magician had told him to be true; he passed  quickly but cautiously through the three halls, so as not even to  touch the walls with his clothes, as the Magician had directed. He  took the Lamp from the niche, threw out the oil, and put it in his  bosom. As he came back through the garden, his eyes were dazzled with  the bright-coloured fruits on the trees, shining like glass. Many of  these he plucked and put in his pockets, and then returned with the  Lamp, and called upon his uncle to help him up the broken steps. \"Give  me the Lamp,\" said the old man, angrily. \"Not till I get out safe,\"  cried the boy. The Magician, in a passion, then slammed down the  trap-door, and Aladdin was shut up fast enough. While crying bitterly,  he by chance rubbed the ring, and a figure appeared before him,  saying, \"I am your slave, the Genius of the Ring; what do you desire?\"    [Illustration]    Aladdin told the Genius of the Ring that he only wanted to be set  free, and to be taken back to his mother. In an instant he found  himself at home, very hungry, and his poor mother was much pleased  to see him again. He told her all that had happened; she then felt  curious to look at the Lamp he had brought, and began rubbing it, to  make it shine brighter. Both were quite amazed at seeing rise before  them a strange figure; this proved to be the Genius of the Lamp, who  asked for their commands. On hearing that food was what they most  wanted, a black slave instantly entered with the choicest fare upon a  dainty dish of silver, and with silver plates for them to eat from.    Aladdin and his mother feasted upon the rich fare brought to them, and  sold the silver dish and plates, on the produce of which they lived  happily for some weeks. Aladdin was now able to dress well, and in  taking his usual walk, he one day chanced to see the Sultan's daughter  coming with her attendants from the baths. He was so much struck with  her beauty, that he fell in love with her at once, and told his mother  that she must go to the Sultan, and ask him to give the Princess to be  his wife. The poor woman said he must be crazy; but her son not only  knew what a treasure he had got in the Magic Lamp, but he had also found  how valuable were the shining fruits he had gathered, which he thought  at the time to be only coloured glass. At first he sent a bowlful of  these jewels--for so they were--to the Sultan, who was amazed at their  richness, and said to Aladdin's mother: \"Your son shall have his wish,  if he can send me, in a week, forty bowls like this, carried by twenty  white and twenty black slaves, handsomely dressed.\" He thought by this  to keep what he had got, and to hear no more of Aladdin. But the Genius  of the Lamp soon brought the bowls of jewels and the slaves, and  Aladdin's mother went with them to the Sultan.    [Illustration]    The Sultan was overjoyed at receiving these rich gifts, and at once  agreed that the Princess Bulbul should be the wife of Aladdin. The  happy youth then summoned the Genius of the Lamp to assist him; and  shortly set out for the Palace. He was dressed in a handsome suit of  clothes, and rode a beautiful horse; by his side marched a number of  attendants, scattering handfuls of gold among the people. As soon as  they were married, Aladdin ordered the Genius of the Lamp to build, in  the course of a night, a most superb Palace, and there the young couple  lived quite happily for some time. One day, when Aladdin was out hunting  with the Sultan, the wicked Magician, who had heard of his good luck,  and wished to get hold of the Magic Lamp, cried out in the streets, \"New  lamps for old ones!\" A silly maid in the Palace, hearing this, got leave  of the Princess to change Aladdin's old Lamp, which she had seen on a  cornice where he always left it, for a new one, and so the Magician got  possession of it.    [Illustration]    As soon as the Magician had safely got the Lamp, he caused the Genius  to remove the Palace, and Bulbul within it, to Africa. Aladdin's grief  was very great, and so was the rage of the Sultan at the loss of the  Princess, and poor Aladdin's life was in some danger, for the Sultan  threatened to kill him if he did not restore his daughter in three  days. Aladdin first called upon the Genius of the Ring to help him,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20439"],[0,"Susan B. Anthony (#3)"],[1,"to the Union as a slave state.[4]           *       *       *       *       *    These were some of the forces at work in the minds of Americans during  Susan's childhood. Her father, a liberal Quaker, was concerned over  the extension of slavery, and she often heard him say that he tried to  avoid purchasing cotton raised by slave labor. This early impression  of the evil of slavery was never erased.    The Quakers' respect for women's equality with men before God also  left its mark on young Susan. As soon as she was old enough she went  regularly to Meeting with her father, for all of the Anthonys were  Quakers. They had migrated to western Massachusetts from Rhode Island,  and there on the frontier had built prosperous farms, comfortable  homes, and a meeting house where they could worship God in their own  way. Susan, sitting with the women and children on the hand-hewn  benches near the big fireplace in the meeting house[5] which her  ancestors had built, found peace and consecration in the simple  unordered service, in the long reverent silence broken by both the men  and the women in the congregation as they were led to say a prayer or  give out a helpful message. Forty families now worshiped here, the  women sitting on one side and the men on the other; but women took  their places with men in positions of honor, Susan's own grandmother,  Hannah Latham Anthony, an elder, sitting in the \"high seat,\" and her  aunt, Hannah Anthony Hoxie, preaching as the spirit moved her. With  this valuation of women accepted as a matter of course in her church  and family circle, Susan took it for granted that it existed  everywhere.    Although her father was a devout Friend, she discovered that he had  the reputation of thinking for himself, following the \"inner light\"  even when its leading differed from the considered judgment of his  fellow Quakers. For this he became a hero to her, especially after she  heard the romantic story of his marriage to Lucy Read who was not a  Quaker. The Anthonys and the Reads had been neighbors for years, and  Lucy was one of the pupils at the \"home school\" which Grandfather  Humphrey Anthony had built for his children on the farm, under the  weeping willow at the front gate. Daniel and Lucy were schoolmates  until Daniel at nineteen was sent to Richard Mott's Friends' boarding  school at Nine Partners on the Hudson. When he returned as a teacher,  he found his old playmate still one of the pupils, but now a beautiful  tall young woman with deep blue eyes and glossy brown hair. Full of  fun, a good dancer, and always dressed in the prettiest clothes, she  was the most popular girl in the neighborhood. Promptly Daniel Anthony  fell in love with her, but an almost insurmountable obstacle stood in  the way: Quakers were not permitted to \"marry out of Meeting.\" This,  however, did not deter Daniel.    [Illustration: Susan B. Anthony Homestead, Adams, Massachusetts]    It was harder for Lucy to make up her mind. She enjoyed parties,  dances, and music. She had a full rich voice, and as she sat at her  spinning wheel, singing and spinning, she often wished that she could  \"go into a ten acre lot with the bars down\"[6] and let her voice out.  If she married Daniel, she would have to give all this up, but she  decided in favor of Daniel. A few nights before the wedding, she went  to her last party and danced until four in the morning while Daniel  looked on and patiently waited until she was ready to leave.    For his transgression of marrying out of Meeting, Daniel had to face  the elders as soon as he returned from his wedding trip. They weighed  the matter carefully, found him otherwise sincere and earnest, and  decided not to turn him out. Lucy gave up her dancing and her singing.  She gave up her pretty bright-colored dresses for plain somber  clothes, but she did not adopt the Quaker dress or use the \"plain  speech.\" She went to meeting with Daniel but never became a Quaker,  feeling always that she could not live up to their strict standard of  righteousness.[7]    This was Susan's heritage--Quaker discipline and austerity lightened  by her father's independent spirit and by the kindly understanding of  her mother who had not forgotten her own fun-loving girlhood; an  environment where men and women were partners in church and at home,  where hard physical work was respected, where help for the needy and  unfortunate was spontaneous, and where education was regarded as so  important that Grandfather Anthony built a school for his children and  the neighbors' in his front yard. Her childhood was close enough to  the Revolution to make Grandfather Read's part in it very real and a  source of great pride. Eagerly and often she listened to the story of  how he enlisted in the Continental army as soon as the news of the  Battle of Lexington reached Cheshire and served with outstanding  bravery under Arnold at Quebec, Ethan Allen at Ticonderoga, and  Colonel Stafford at Bennington while his young wife waited anxiously  for him throughout the long years of the war.           *       *       *       *       *    The wide valley in the Berkshire Hills where Susan grew up made a  lasting impression on her. There was beauty all about her--the fruit  trees blooming in the spring, the meadows white with daisies, the  brook splashing over the rocks and sparkling in the summer sun, the  flaming colors of autumn, the strength and companionship of the hills  when the countryside was white with snow. She seldom failed to watch  the sun set behind Greylock.    Her father's cotton mill flourished. Regarded as one of the most  promising, successful young men of the district, he soon attracted the  attention of Judge John McLean, a cotton manufacturer of Battenville,  New York, who, eager to enlarge his mills, saw in Daniel Anthony an  able manager. Daniel, always ready to take the next step ahead,  accepted McLean's offer, and on a sunny July day in 1826, Susan drove  with her family through the hills forty-four miles to the new world of  Battenville.    Here in the home of Judge McLean, she saw Negroes for the first time,  Negroes working to earn their freedom. Startled by their black faces,  she was a little afraid, but when her father explained that in the  South they could be sold like cattle and torn from their families, her  fear turned to pity.    At the district school, taught by a woman in summer and by a man in  the winter, she learned to sew, spell, read, and write, and she wanted  to study long division but the schoolmaster, unable to teach it, saw  no reason why a woman should care for such knowledge. Her father, then  realizing the need of better education for his five children, Guelma,  Susan, Hannah, Daniel, and Mary, established a school for them in the  new brick building where he had opened a store. Later on when their  new brick house was finished, he set aside a large room for the  school, and here for the first time in that district the pupils had  separate seats, stools without backs, instead of the usual benches  around the schoolroom walls. He engaged as teachers young women who  had studied a year or two in a female seminary; and because female  seminaries were rare in those days, women teachers with up-to-date  training were hard to find. Only a few visionaries believed in the  education of women. Nearby Emma Willard's recently established Troy  Female Seminary was being watched with interest and suspicion. Mary  Lyon, who had not yet founded her own seminary at Mt. Holyoke, was  teaching at Zilpha Grant's school in Ipswich, Massachusetts, and one  of her pupils, Mary Perkins, came to Battenville to teach the Anthony  children. Mary Perkins brought new methods and new studies to the  little school. She introduced a primer with small black illustrations  which fascinated Susan. She taught the children to recite poetry,  drilled them regularly in calisthenics, and longed to add music as  well, but Daniel Anthony forbade this, for Quakers believed that music  might seduce the thoughts of the young. So Susan, although she often  had a song in her heart, had to repress it and never knew the joy of  singing the songs of childhood.    Her father, looking upon the millworkers as part of his family,  started an evening school for them, often teaching it himself or  calling in the family teacher. He organized a temperance society among  the workers, and all signed a pledge never to drink distilled liquor.  When he opened a store in the new brick building, he refused to sell  liquor, although Judge McLean warned him it would ruin his trade.  Daniel Anthony went even further. He resolved not to serve liquor when  the millworkers' houses were built and the neighbors came to the  \"raising.\" Again Judge McLean protested, feeling certain that the men  and boys would demand their gin and their rum, but Susan and her  sisters helped their mother serve lemonade, tea, coffee, doughnuts,  and gingerbread in abundance. The men joked a bit about the lack of  strong drink which they expected with every meal, but they did not  turn away from the good substitutes which were offered and they were  on hand for the next \"raising.\" Hearing all of this discussed at home,  Susan, again proud of her father, ardently advocated the cause of  temperance.           *       *       *       *       *    The mill was still of great interest to her and she watched every  operation closely in her spare time, longing to try her hand at the  work. One day when a \"spooler\" was ill, Susan and her sister Hannah  eagerly volunteered to take her place. Their father was ready to let  them try, pleased by their interest and curious to see what they could  do, but their mother protested that the mill was no place for  children. Finally Susan's earnest pleading won her mother's reluctant  consent, and the two girls drew lots for the job. It went to  twelve-year-old Susan on the condition that she divide her earnings"]]]
