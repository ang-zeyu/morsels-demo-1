These parts together with the neck  constitute the trunk. As a consequence of these things, in the  backbone of the rabbit there are four regions: the neck, or cervical  part, consisting of seven vertebrae, the thoracic part of twelve joined to  ribs, the abdominal (also called the lumbar) region of seven without  ribs, and the tail or caudal of about fifteen. Between the lumbar and  caudal come four vertebrae, the sacral, which tend to run together into  a bony mass as the animal grows old, and which form a firm  attachment for the base of the hind limb.      Section 4. The thorax and abdomen are separated by a partition, the  diaphragm (Figure 1 dia.). This structure is distinctive of that class of  the vertebrata called mammals, and which includes man, most of  the larger and commoner land animals, and whales and manatee.  We shall find later that it is essentially connected with the perfection  of the air breathing to which this group has attained. Another  characteristic shared by all mammals, and by no other creature, is  the presence of hair. In birds we have an equally characteristic cover  in the feathers, the frog is naked, and the fishes we find either naked  skins or scales.      Section 5. The short strong fore limbs are adapted to the burrowing  habit, and have five digits; the hind limbs are very much longer and  muscular, enable the animal to progress rapidly by short leaps, and  they have four toes. If the student thinks it worth while to attempt to  remember the number of digits-- it is the fault of examiners if any  value dose attach to such intrinsically valueless facts-- he should  associate the number 54 (5 in front, 4 behind) with the rabbit, and  observe that with the frog the reverse is the case.      Section 6. We may note here the meaning of certain terms we shall  be constantly employing. The head end of the rabbit is anterior, the  tail end posterior, the backbone side of the body-- the upper side in  life-- is dorsal, the breast and belly side, the lower side of the  animal, is ventral. If we imagine the rabbit sawn asunder, as it were,  by a plane passing through the head and tail, that would be the  median plane, and parts on either side of it are lateral, and left or  right according as they lie to the animal's left or right. In a limb, or in  the internal organs, the part nearest the central organ, or axis, is  proximal, the more remote or terminal parts are distal. For instance,  the mouth is anteriorly placed, the tongue on its ventral wall; the  tongue is median, the eyes are lateral, and the fingers are distal to  the elbow. The student must accustom himself to these words, and  avoid, in his descriptions, the use of such terms as \"above,\"  \"below,\" \"outside,\" which vary with the position in which we conceive  the animal placed.      Section 7. So much for the general form; we may note a few facts of  general knowledge, in connection with the rabbit's life-activity. In a  day of the rabbit's life a considerable amount of work is done-- the  animal runs hither and thither, for instance; in other words, a certain  mass of matter is moved through space, and for that we know force  must be exerted. Whence comes the force?      Section 8. We find the rabbit occupies a considerable amount of its  time in taking in vegetable matter, consisting chiefly of more or less  complex combustible and unstable organic compounds. It is a pure  vegetarian, and a remarkably moderate drinker. Some but only a  small proportion, of the vegetable matter it eats, leaves its body  comparatively unchanged, in little pellets, the faeces, in the process  of defaecation. For the rest we have to account.      Section 9. We find, also, that the rabbit breathes air into its lungs,  which is returned to the atmosphere with a lessened amount of  oxygen, and the addition of a perceptible amount of carbon dioxide.  The rabbit also throws off, or excretes, a fluid, the urine, which  consists of water with a certain partially oxydised substance  containing nitrogen, and called urea, and other less important salts.  The organs within the body, by which the urine is separated, are  called the kidneys.      Section 10. Repeating these facts in other words, the rabbit takes  into its body complex and unstable organic compounds containing  nitrogen, carbon, hydrogen, a certain amount of oxygen, a small  quantity of sulphur, and still smaller amounts of other elements. It  also breathes in oxygen.      Section 11. It returns a certain rejected part of its food comparatively  unchanged. Besides this, it returns carbon dioxide and water, which  are completely oxydised, and very simple and stable bodies, and  urea-- a less completely oxydised compound, but a very simple one  compared with the food constituents.      Section 12. Now the chemist tells us that when a stable body is  formed, or when an unstable compound decomposes into simpler  stable ones, force is evolved. The oxydation of carbon, for instance,  in the fireplace, is the formation of the stable compound called  carbon dioxide, and light and heat are evolved. The explosion of  dynamite, again is the decomposition of an unstable compound.  Hence, we begin to perceive that force-- the vital force-- which keeps  the rabbit moving, is supplied by the decomposition and partial  oxydation of compounds continued in its food, to carbon dioxide,  water, urea, and smaller quantities of other substances.      Section 13. This is the roughest statement of the case possible, but it  will give the general idea underlying our next chapters. We shall  consider how the food enters the body and is taken up into the  system, how it is conveyed to the muscles in the limbs, to the nerve  centres, and to wherever work is done, to be there decomposed and  partially oxydised, and finally how the products of its activity-- the  katastases, of which the three principal are carbon dioxide, water,  and urea-- are removed from the body.      Section 14. There are one or two comparatively modern terms that  we may note here. This decomposition of unstable chemical  compounds, releasing energy, is called kataboly. A reverse process,  which has a less conspicuous part in our first view of the animal's life  action, by which unstable compounds are built up and energy  stored, is called anaboly. The katastases are the products of  kataboly.      Section 15. In an ordinary animal, locomotion and other activity  predominate over nutritive processes, which fact we may express, in  the terms just given, by saying that kataboly prevails over anaboly.  An animal, as we have just explained, is an apparatus for the  decomposition and partial oxydation of certain compounds, and  these are obtained either directly or indirectly-- through other animals,  in the case of meat-eaters-- from the vegetable kingdom.  As the student will learn early in his botanical reading, the typical  plant has, in its green colouring matter, chlorophyll, a trap to catch  the radiating energy of the sun, and to accomplish, by the  absorption of that energy, the synthesis (building up) of those  organic compounds which the animal destroys. The typical plant is,  on whole, passive and synthetic, or anabolic; the typical animal,  active and katabolic; and the excess of kataboly over anaboly in the  animal is compensated for by the anabolic work stored up, as it  were, by the plant, which is, directly or indirectly, the animal's food.        2. _The Alimentary Canal of the Rabbit_    Section 16. Figure 1 represents the general anatomy of the rabbit,  but is especially intended to show the alimentary (= food) canal,  shortened to a certain extent, and with the proportions altered, in  order to avoid any confusing complications. It is evidently simply a  coiled tube-- coiled for the sake of packing-- with occasional  dilatations, and with one side-shunt, the caecum (cae.), into which  the food enters, and is returned to the main line, after probably  absorbent action, imperfectly understood at present. A spiral fold in  this cul-de-sac {bottom-of-sack}, which is marked externally by  constrictions, has a directive influence on the circulation of its  contents. The student should sketch Figure 1 once or twice, and  make himself familiar with the order and names of the parts before  proceeding. We have, in succession, the mouth (M.), separated from  the nasal passage (Na.) above the palate; the pharynx (ph.), where  the right and left nasal passages open by the posterior nares into  the mouth; the oesophagus (oes.); the bag-like stomach, its left  (Section 6) end being called the cardiac (cd.st.), and its right the  pyloric end (py.); the U-shaped duodenum (ddnm.) and the very long  and greatly coiled ileum (il.). The duodenum and ileum together form  the small intestine; and the ileum is dilated at its distal end into a  thick-walled sacculus rotundus (s.r.), beyond which point comes the  large intestine. The colon (co.) and rectum (r.) continue the main line  of the alimentary canal; but, at the beginning of the large intestine,  there is also inserted a great side-shunt, the caecum (cae.), ending  blindly in a fleshy vermiform appendix (v.ap.). The figure will indicate  how the parts are related better than any verbal description can.  Between the coiling alimentary tube and the body walls is a space,  into which the student cuts when he begins dissecting; this is the  peritoneal cavity (pt.). A thin, transparent membrane, the mesentery,  holds the intestines in place, and binds them to the dorsal wall of  this peritoneal space.      Section 17. The food stuffs of an animal, the unstable compounds  destined ultimately to be worked into its life, and to leave it again in  the form of katastases (Section 13), fall into two main divisions.
