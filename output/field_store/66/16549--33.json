[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18818"],[0,"On the Evolution of Language (#3)"],[1,"particles are  here called _article_ pronouns. In the conjugation of the verb they take  an important part, and have by some writers been called _transitions_.  Besides pointing out with particularity the person, number, and gender  or the subject and object, they perform the same offices that are  usually performed by those inflections of the verb that occur to make  them agree in gender, number, and person with the subject. In those  Indian languages where the article pronouns are not found, and the  personal pronouns only are used, the verb is usually inflected to agree  with the subject or object, or both, in the same particulars.    The article pronouns as they point out person, number, gender, and  case of the subject and object, are not simple particles, but are to  a greater or lesser extent compound; their component elements may be  broken apart and placed in different parts of the verb. Again, the  article pronoun in some languages may have its elements combined into a  distinct word in such a manner that it will not be incorporated in the  verb, but will be placed immediately before it. For this reason the term  _article pronoun_ has been chosen rather than _attached pronoun_. The  older term, _transition_, was given to them because of their analogy in  function to verbal inflections.    Thus the verb of an Indian language contains within itself incorporated  article pronouns which point out with great particularity the gender,  number, and person of the subject and object. In this manner verb,  pronoun, and adjective are combined, and to this extent these parts of  speech are undifferentiated.    In some languages the article pronoun constitutes a distinct word, but  whether free or incorporated it is a complex tissue of adjectives.    Again, nouns sometimes contain particles within themselves to predicate  possession, and to this extent nouns and verbs are undifferentiated.    The verb is relatively of much greater importance in an Indian tongue  than in a civilized language. To a large extent the pronoun is  incorporated in the verb as explained above, and thus constitutes a  part of its conjugation.    Again, adjectives are used as intransitive verbs, as in most Indian  languages there is no verb _to be_ used as a predicant or copula.  Where in English we would say _the man is good_, the Indian would say  _that man good_, using the adjective as an intransitive verb, _i.e._,  as a predicant. If he desired to affirm it in the past tense, the  intransitive verb _good_, would be inflected, or otherwise modified, to  indicate the tense; and so, in like manner, all adjectives when used to  predicate can be modified to indicate mode, tense, number, person, &c.,  as other intransitive verbs.    Adverbs are used as intransitive verbs. In English we may say _he is  there_; the Indian would say _that person there_ usually preferring  the demonstrative to the personal pronoun. The adverb _there_ would,  therefore, be used as a predicant or intransitive verb, and might be  conjugated to denote different modes, tenses, numbers, persons, etc.  Verbs will often receive adverbial qualifications by the use of  incorporated particles, and, still further, verbs may contain within  themselves adverbial limitations without our being able to trace such  meanings to any definite particles or parts of the verb.    Prepositions are intransitive verbs. In English we may say _the hat is  on the table_; the Indian would say _that hat on table_; or he might  change the order, and say _that hat table on_; but the preposition  _on_ would be used as an intransitive verb to predicate, and may be  conjugated. Prepositions may often be found as particles incorporated  in verbs, and, still further, verbs may contain within themselves  prepositional meanings without our being able to trace such meanings to  any definite particles within the verb. But the verb connotes such ideas  that something is needed to complete its meaning, that something being  a limiting or qualifying word, phrase, or clause. Prepositions may be  prefixed, infixed, or suffixed to nouns, _i.e._, they may be particles  incorporated in nouns.    Nouns may be used as intransitive verbs under the circumstances when in  English we would use a noun as the complement of a sentence after the  verb _to be_.    The verb, therefore, often includes within itself subject, direct  object, indirect object, qualifier, and relation-idea. Thus it is that  the study of an Indian language is, to a large extent, the study of its  verbs.    Thus adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, and nouns are used as  intransitive verbs; and, to such extent, adjectives, adverbs,  prepositions, nouns and verbs are undifferentiated.    From the remarks above, it will be seen that Indian verbs often include  within themselves meanings which in English are expressed by adverbs and  adverbial phrases and clauses. Thus the verb may express within itself  direction, manner, instrument, and purpose, one or all, as the verb _to  go_ may be represented by a word signifying _go home_; another, _go away  from home_; another, _go to a place other than home_; another, _go from  a place other than home_; one, _go from this place_, with reference to  home; one, to _go up_; another, to _go down_; one, _go around_; and,  perhaps, there will be a verb _go up hill_; another, _go up a valley_;  another, _go up a river_, etc. Then we may have _to go on foot_, _to go  on horseback_, _to go in a canoe_; still another, _to go for water_;  another _for wood_, etc. Distinct words may be used for all these, or a  fewer number used, and these varied by incorporated particles. In like  manner, the English verb _to break_ may be represented by several words,  each of which will indicate the manner of performing the act or the  instrument with which it is done. Distinct words may be used, or a  common word varied with incorporated particles.    The verb _to strike_ may be represented by several words, signifying  severally _to strike with the fist_, _to strike with a club_, _to strike  with the open hand_, _to strike with a whip_, _to strike with a switch_,  to strike with a flat instrument, etc. A common word may be used with  incorporated particles or entirely different words used.    Mode in an Indian tongue is a rather difficult subject. Modes analogous  to those of civilized tongues are found, and many conditions and  qualifications appear in the verb which in English and other civilized  languages appear as adverbs, and adverbial phrases and clauses. No plane  of separation can be drawn between such adverbial qualifications and  true modes. Thus there may be a form of the verb, which shows that the  speaker makes a declaration as certain, _i.e._, an _indicative_ mode;  another which shows that the speaker makes a declaration with doubt,  _i.e._, a _dubitative_ mode; another that he makes a declaration on  hearsay, _i.e._, a _quotative_ mode; another form will be used in making  a command, giving an _imperative_ mode; another in imploration, _i.e._,  an _implorative_ mode; another form to denote permission, _i.e._,  a _permissive_ mode; another in negation, _i.e._, a _negative_ mode;  another form will be used to indicate that the action is simultaneous  with some other action, _i.e._, a _simulative_ mode; another to denote  desire or wish that something be done, _i.e._, a _desiderative_ mode;  another that the action ought to be done, _i.e._, an _obligative_  mode; another that action is repetitive from time to time, _i.e._,  a _frequentative_ mode; another that action is caused, _i.e._,  a _causative_ mode, etc.    These forms of the verb, which we are compelled to call modes, are of  great number. Usually with each of them a particular modal particle or  incorporated adverb will be used; but the particular particle which  gives the qualified meaning may not always be discovered; and in one  language a different word will be introduced, wherein another the same  word will be used with an incorporated particle.    It is stated above that incorporated particles may be used to indicate  direction, manner, instrument, and purpose; in fact, any adverbial  qualification whatever may be made by an incorporated particle instead  of an adverb as a distinct word.    No line of demarkation can be drawn between these adverbial particles  and those mentioned above as modal particles. Indeed it seems best to  treat all these forms of the verb arising from, incorporated particles  as distinct modes. In this sense, then, an Indian language has a  multiplicity of modes. It should be further remarked that in many cases  these modal or adverbial particles are excessively worn, so that they  may appear as additions or changes of simple vowel or consonant sounds.  When incorporated particles are thus used, distinct adverbial words,  phrases, or clauses may also be employed, and the idea expressed twice.    In an Indian language it is usually found difficult to elaborate a  system of tenses in paradigmatic form. Many tenses or time particles  are found incorporated in verbs. Some of these time particles are  excessively worn, and may appear rather as inflections than as  incorporated particles. Usually rather distinct present, past, and  future tenses are discovered; often a remote or ancient past, and less  often an immediate future. But great specification of time in relation  to the present and in relation to other time is usually found.    It was seen above that adverbial particles cannot be separated from  modal particles. In like manner tense particles cannot be separated from  adverbial and modal particles.    In an Indian language adverbs are differentiated only to a limited  extent. Adverbial qualifications are found in the verb, and thus there  are a multiplicity of modes and tenses, and no plane of demarcation  can be drawn between mode and tense. From preceding statements it will  appear that a verb in an Indian tongue may have "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18828"],[0,"Selections From the Writings of the Báb (#3)"],[1,"Thee.  Thou art verily the Lord of grace abounding. Thou dost indeed suffice  every created thing and causest it to be independent of all things, while  nothing in the heavens or on the earth or that which lieth between them  can ever suffice Thee.'    Verily Thou art the Self-Sufficient, the All-Knowing; Thou art indeed  potent over all things.          Tablet To The First Letter Of The Living      This is that which We have revealed for the First Believer in Him Whom God  shall make manifest, that it may serve as an admonition from Our presence  unto all mankind.    In the Name of the Almighty, the Best Beloved.    Lauded and glorified is He Who is the sovereign Lord of the kingdoms of  heaven and earth and whatever is between them. Say, verily unto Him shall  all return, and He is the One Who guideth at His Own behest whomsoever He  pleaseth. Say, all men beseech His blessings and He is supreme over all  created things. He is indeed the All-Glorious, the Mighty, the  Well-Beloved.    This is an epistle from the letter '_Th_a' unto him who is the First  Believer. Bear thou witness that verily He is I, Myself, the Sovereign,  the Omnipotent. He is the One Who ordaineth life and death and unto Him  shall all return. Indeed there is none other God but Him and all men bow  down in adoration before Him. Verily Thy Lord, God, shall presently  recompense every one as He ordaineth, even swifter than uttering the words  'Be thou, and it is'.    God hath in truth testified in His Book and so also have testified the  company of His angels, His Messengers and those endued with divine  knowledge, that thou hast believed in God and in His signs and that  everyone is guided aright by virtue of thy guidance. This is indeed a  boundless grace which God, the Ever-Living, the Self-Subsisting, hath  graciously conferred upon thee aforetime and will confer hereafter. And  since thou didst believe in God before the creation, He hath in truth, at  His own behest, raised thee up in every Revelation. There is no God but  Him, the Sovereign Protector, the All-Glorious.    It behooveth you to proclaim the Cause of God unto all created things as a  token of grace from His presence; no God is there but Him, the Most  Generous, the All-Compelling.    Say: All matters must be referred to the Book of God; I am indeed the  First to believe in God and in His signs; I am the One Who divulgeth and  proclaimeth the Truth and I have been invested with every excellent title  of God, the Mighty, the Incomparable. Verily I have attained the Day of  the First Manifestation and by the bidding of the Lord and as a token of  His grace, I shall attain the Day of the Latter Manifestation. There is no  God but Him and at the appointed hour everyone shall bow down unto Him in  adoration.    I render thanks and yield praise unto God for having been chosen by Him as  the Exponent of His Cause in bygone days and in the days to come; there is  none other God save Him, the Glorified, the All-Praised, the Ever-Abiding.  Whatever is in the heavens and on the earth is His and through Him are we  guided aright.    O people of the Bayan! Those who embrace the Truth must turn unto Me, as  ordained in the Book and divine guidance will be vouchsafed to whosoever  attaineth My presence.          Extracts From An Epistle To Muhammad Shah      The substance wherewith God hath created Me is not the clay out of which  others have been formed. He hath conferred upon Me that which the  worldly-wise can never comprehend, nor the faithful discover ... I am one  of the sustaining pillars of the Primal Word of God. Whosoever hath  recognized Me, hath known all that is true and right, and hath attained  all that is good and seemly; and whosoever hath failed to recognize Me,  hath turned away from all that is true and right and hath succumbed to  everything evil and unseemly.    I swear by the righteousness of Thy Lord, the Lord of all created things,  the Lord of all the worlds! Were a man to rear in this world as many  edifices as possible and worship God through every virtuous deed which  God's knowledge embraceth, and attain the presence of the Lord, and were  he, even to a measure less than that which is accountable before God, to  bear in his heart a trace of malice towards Me, all his deeds would be  reduced to naught and he would be deprived of the glances of God's favour,  become the object of His wrath and assuredly perish. For God hath ordained  that all the good things which lie in the treasury of His knowledge shall  be attained through obedience unto Me, and every fire recorded in His  Book, through disobedience unto Me. Methinks in this day and from this  station I behold all those who cherish My love and follow My behest  abiding within the mansions of Paradise, and the entire company of Mine  adversaries consigned to the lowest depths of hell-fire.    By My life! But for the obligation to acknowledge the Cause of Him Who is  the Testimony of God ... I would not have announced this unto thee... All  the keys of heaven God hath chosen to place on My right hand, and all the  keys of hell on My left...    I am the Primal Point from which have been generated all created things. I  am the Countenance of God Whose splendour can never be obscured, the Light  of God Whose radiance can never fade. Whoso recognizeth Me, assurance and  all good are in store for him, and whoso faileth to recognize Me, infernal  fire and all evil await him...    I swear by God, the Peerless, the Incomparable, the True One: for no other  reason hath He--the supreme Testimony of God--invested Me with clear signs  and tokens than that all men may be enabled to submit to His Cause.    By the righteousness of Him Who is the Absolute Truth, were the veil to be  lifted, thou wouldst witness on this earthly plane all men sorely  afflicted with the fire of the wrath of God, a fire fiercer and greater  than the fire of hell, with the exception of those who have sought shelter  beneath the shade of the tree of My love. For they in very truth are the  blissful...    God beareth Me witness, I was not a man of learning, for I was trained as  a merchant. In the year sixty(3) God graciously infused my soul with the  conclusive evidences and weighty knowledge which characterize Him Who is  the Testimony of God--may peace be upon Him--until finally in that year I  proclaimed God's hidden Cause and unveiled its well-guarded Pillar, in  such wise that no one could refute it. 'That he who should perish might  perish with a clear proof before him and he who should live might live by  clear proof.'(4)    In that same year [year 60] I despatched a messenger and a book unto thee,  that thou mightest act towards the Cause of Him Who is the Testimony of  God as befitteth the station of thy sovereignty. But inasmuch as dark,  dreadful and dire calamity had been irrevocably ordained by the Will of  God, the book was not submitted to thy presence, through the intervention  of such as regard themselves the well-wishers of the government. Up to the  present, when nearly four years have passed, they have not duly presented  it to Your Majesty. However, now that the fateful hour is drawing nigh,  and because it is a matter of faith, not a worldly concern, therefore I  have given thee a glimpse of what hath transpired.    I swear by God! Shouldst thou know the things which in the space of these  four years have befallen Me at the hands of thy people and thine army,  thou wouldst hold thy breath from fear of God, unless thou wouldst rise to  obey the Cause of Him Who is the Testimony of God and make amends for thy  shortcomings and failure.    While I was in _Sh_iraz the indignities which befell Me at the hands of  its wicked and depraved Governor waxed so grievous that if thou wert  acquainted with but a tithe thereof, thou wouldst deal him retributive  justice. For as a result of his unmitigated oppression, thy royal court  hath become, until the Day of Resurrection, the object of the wrath of  God. Moreover, his indulgence in alcohol had grown so excessive that he  was never sober enough to make a sound judgement. Therefore, disquieted, I  was obliged to set out from _Sh_iraz with the aim of attaining the  enlightened and exalted court of Your Majesty. The Mu'tamidu'd-Dawlih then  became aware of the truth of the Cause and manifested exemplary servitude  and devotion to His chosen ones. When some of the ignorant people in his  city arose to stir up sedition, he defended the divine Truth by affording  Me protection for a while in the privacy of the Governor's residence. At  length, having attained the good-pleasure of God, he repaired to his  habitation in the all-highest Paradise. May God reward him graciously...    Following his ascension to the eternal Kingdom, the vicious Gurgin,  resorting to all manner of treachery, false oaths and coercion, sent Me  away from Isfahan with an escort of five guards on a journey which lasted  seven days, without providing the barest necessities for My travel (Alas!  Alas! for the things which have touched Me!), until eventually Your  Majesty's order came, instructing Me to proceed to Maku...    I swear by the Most Great Lord! Wert thou to be told in what place I  dwell, the first person to have mercy on Me would be thyself. In the heart  of a mountain is a fortress [Maku] ... the inmates of which are confined  to two guards and four dogs. Picture, then, My plight... I swear by the  truth of God! Were he who hath been willing to treat Me in such a manner  to know Who it is Whom he hath so treated, he, verily, would never in his  life be happy. Nay--I, verily, acquaint thee with the truth of the  matter--it is as if he hath imprisoned all the Prophets, and all the men of  truth and all the chosen ones...    When this decree was made known unto Me, I wrote to him who administereth  the affairs of the kingdom, saying: 'Put Me to death, I adjure thee by  God, and send My head wherever thou"]]]
