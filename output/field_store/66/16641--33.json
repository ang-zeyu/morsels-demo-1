The simple lack of capacity on the part of the potter who undertook to  reproduce a model would lead to the modification of all but the most  simple shapes.    The acquisition of the art by a superior or an inferior race, or one of  different habits would lead to decided changes. A people accustomed to  carrying objects upon the head, on acquiring earthen vessels would shape  the bases and the handles to facilitate this use.    Improvements in the methods of manufacture are of the greatest  importance in the progress of an art. The introduction of the lathe, for  example, might almost revolutionize form in clay.    As arts multiply, clay is applied to new uses. Its employment in the  manufacture of lamps, whistles, or toys would lead to a multitude of  distinct and unique forms.    The acquisition of a new vessel-making material by a nation of potters  and the association of the forms developed through its inherent  qualities or structure would often lead ceramic shapes into new  channels.    [Illustration: _a_, wood. _b_, clay. FIG. 473.--Coincident forms.]    The contact of a nation of potters with a nation of carvers in wood  would tend very decidedly to modify the utensils of the former. One  example may be given which will illustrate the possibilities of such  exotic influences upon form. In Fig. 473, _a_, we have an Alaskan vessel  carved in wood. It represents a beaver grasping a stick in its hands and  teeth. The conception is so unusual and the style of vessel so  characteristic of the people that we should not expect to find it  repeated in other regions; but the ancient graves of the Middle  Mississippi Valley have furnished a number of very similar vessels in  clay, one of which is outlined in _b_. While this remarkable coincidence  is suggestive of ethnic relationships which do not call for attention  here, it serves to illustrate the possibilities of modification by  simple contact.    [Illustration: _a_ _b_ FIG. 471.--Form resulting from accident.]    A curious example illustrative of possible transformation by  adventitious circumstances is found in the collection from the province  of ancient Tusayan. A small vessel of sphynx-like appearance, possibly  derived more or less remotely from a skin vessel, has a noticeable  resemblance to some life form, Fig. 474, _a_. The fore-legs are  represented by two large bosses, the wide-open mouth takes the place of  the severed neck, and a handle connects the top of the rim with the back  of the vessel. The handle being broken off and the vessel inverted,  _b_, there is a decided change; we are struck by the resemblance to a  frog or toad. The original legs, having dark concentric lines painted  around them, look like large protruding eyes, and the mouth gapes in the  most realistic manner, while the two short broken ends of the handle  resemble legs and serve to support the vessel in an upright position,  completing the illusion. The fetich-hunting Pueblo Indian, picking up  this little vessel in its mutilated condition, would probably at once  give to it the sacred character of the water animal which it resembles,  and it might readily transmit its peculiarities of form to other  generations of vessels.    It is not necessary in this study to refer at length to the influence of  metallic vessels upon ceramic forms. They do not usually appear until  the ceramic art is far advanced and often receive a heritage of shape  from earthen forms. Afterwards, when the inherent qualities of the metal  have stamped their individuality upon utensils, the debt is paid back to  clay with interest, as will be seen by reference to later forms in many  parts of the world.      +MODIFICATION BY INTENTION.+    _To enhance usefulness._--There can be no doubt that the desire upon the  part of the archaic potter to increase the usefulness and convenience of  his utensils has been an important agent in the modification of form.  The earliest vessels employed were often clumsy and difficult to handle.  The favorite conch shell would hold water for him who wished to drink,  but the breaking away of spines and the extraction of the interior whorl  improved it immeasurably. The clumsy mortar of stone, with its thick  walls and great weight, served a useful purpose, but it needed a very  little intelligent thought to show that thin walls and neatly-trimmed  margins were much preferable.    Vessels of clay, aside from the forms imposed upon, them by their  antecedents and associates, would necessarily be subject to changes  suggested by the growing needs of man. These would be worked out with  ever-increasing ease by his unfolding genius for invention. Further  investigation of this phase of development would carry me beyond the  limits set for this paper.    _To please fancy._--The skill acquired by the handling of clay in  constructing vessels and in efforts to increase their usefulness would  open an expansive field for the play of fancy. The potter would no  sooner succeed in copying vessels having life form than he would be  placed in a position to realize his capacity to imitate forms not  peculiar to vessels. His ambition would in time lead him even beyond the  limits of nature and he would invade the realm of imagination, embodying  the conceptions of superstition in the plastic clay. This tendency would  be encouraged and perpetuated by the relegation of vessels of particular  forms to particular ceremonies.            +ORIGIN OF ORNAMENT.+      The birth of the embellishing art must be sought in that stage of animal  development when instinct began to discover that certain attributes or  adornments increased attractiveness. When art in its human sense came  into existence ideas of embellishment soon extended from the _person_,  with, which they had been associated, to all things with which man had  to deal. The processes of the growth of the aesthetic idea are long and  obscure and cannot be taken up in this place.    The various elements of embellishment in which the ceramic art is  interested may be assigned to two great classes, based upon the  character of the conceptions associated with them. These are  _ideographic_ and _non-ideographic_. In the present paper I shall treat  chiefly of the non ideographic, reserving the ideographic for a second  paper.    Elements, non-ideographic from the start, are derived mainly from two  sources: 1st, from objects, natural or artificial, associated with the  arts; and, 2d, from the suggestions of accidents attending construction.  Natural objects abound in features highly suggestive of embellishment  and these are constantly employed in art. Artificial objects have two  classes of features capable of giving rise to ornament: these are  _constructional_ and _functional_. In a late stage of development all  things in nature and in art, however complex or foreign to the art in  its practice, are subject to decorative treatment. This latter is the  realistic pictorial stage, one of which the student of native American  culture needs to take little cognizance.    Elements of design are not invented outright: man modifies, combines,  and recombines elements or ideas already in existence, but does not  create.    A classification of the sources of decorative motives employed in the  ceramic art is given in the following diagram:                      /Suggestions of features of natural utensils or objects.                    |                               /                    |                               |           /Handles.                    |                               |           |Legs                    |                               | Functional|Bands                    |                               |           \\Perforations, etc.                    |                               |                    |Suggestions of features of     |                    |artificial utensils or objects.|              /The coil.                    |                               |              |The seam.

Shells of mollusks are  exquisitely embellished with ribs, spines, nodes, and colors. The same  is true to a somewhat limited extent of the shells of the turtle and the  armadillo and of the hard cases of fruits.    These decorative features, though not essential to the utensil, are  nevertheless inseparable parts of it, and are cast or unconsciously  copied by a very primitive people when similar articles are artificially  produced in plastic material. In this way a utensil may acquire  ornamental characters long before the workman has learned to take  pleasure in such details or has conceived an idea beyond that of simple  utility. This may be called unconscious embellishment. In this  fortuitous fashion a ribbed variety of fruit shell would give rise to a  ribbed vessel in clay; one covered with spines would suggest a noded  vessel, etc. When taste came to be exercised upon such objects these  features would be retained and copied for the pleasure they afforded.    [Illustration: _a._--Shell vessel. _b._--Copy in clay. FIG. 475.--Scroll  derived from the spire of a conch shell.]    Passing by the many simple elements of decoration that by this  unconscious process could be derived from such "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1996"],[0,"The Divine Comedy, Volume 2, Purgatory (#3)"],[1,"for three months now the Celestial Pilot  had received graciously all who had taken advantage of it to gain  remission of their sins.        And I, \"If a new law take not from thee memory or practice of the  song of love which was wont to quiet in me all my longings, may  it please thee therewith somewhat to comfort my soul, which  coming hither with its body is so wearied.\"    \"Love which in my mind discourseth with me,\"[1] began he then so  sweetly that the sweetness still within me sounds.[2] My Master,  and I, and that folk who were with him, appeared so content as if  naught else could touch the mind of any.    [1] The first verse of a canzone by Dante; the canzone is the  second of those upon which he comments in his Convito.    [2] Every English reader recalls Milton's Sonnet to Mr. Henry  Lawes:--  \"Dante shall give Fame leave to set thee higher    Than his Casella, whom he woo'd to sing,     Met in the milder shades of purgatory.\"    Nothing is known of Casella beyond what is implied in Dante's  affectionate record of their meeting.      We were all fixed and attentive to his notes; and lo! the  venerable old man crying, \"What is this, ye laggard spirits? What  negligence, what stay is this? Run to the mountain to strip off  the slough that lets not God be manifest to you.\"    As, when gathering grain or tare, the doves assembled at their  feeding, quiet, without display of their accustomed pride, if  aught appear of which they are afraid, suddenly let the food  alone, because they are assailed by a greater care, so I saw that  fresh troop leave the song, and go towards the hill-side, like  one that goes but knows not where he may come out. Nor was our  departure less speedy.        CANTO III. Ante-Purgatory.--Souls of those who have died in  contumacy of the Church.-- Manfred.      Inasmuch as the sudden flight had scattered them over the plain,  turned to the mount whereto reason spurs us, I drew me close to  my trusty companion. And how should I without him have run? Who  would have drawn me up over the mountain? He seemed to me of his  own self remorseful. O conscience, upright and stainless, how  bitter a sting to thee is little fault!    When his feet left the haste that takes the seemliness from every  act, my mind, which at first had been restrained, let loose its  attention, as though eager, and I turned my face unto the hill  that towards the heaven rises highest from the sea. The sun,  which behind was flaming ruddy, was broken in front of me by the  figure that the staying of its rays upon me formed. When I saw  the ground darkened only in front of me, I turned me to my side  with fear of being abandoned: and my Comfort, wholly turning to  me, began to say, \"Why dost thou still distrust? Dost thou not  believe me with thee, and that I guide thee? It is now evening  there where the body is buried within which I cast a shadow;  Naples holds it, and from Brundusium it is taken; if now in front  of me there is no shadow, marvel not more than at the heavens of  which one hinders not the other's radiance. To suffer torments,  both hot and cold, bodies like this the Power ordains, which  wills not that how it acts be revealed to us. Mad is he who hopes  that our reason can traverse the infinite way which One Substance  in Three Persons holds. Be content, human race, with the  quia;[1]; for if ye had been able to see everything, need had not  been for Mary to hear child: and ye have seen desiring  fruitlessly men such [2] that their desire would have been  quieted, which is given them eternally for a grief. I speak of  Aristotle and of Plato, and of many others;\" and here he bowed  his front, and said no more, and remained disturbed.    [1] Quic is used here, as often in mediaeval Latin, for quod. The  meaning is, Be content to know that the thing is, seek not to  know WHY or HOW--propter quid--it is as it is.    [2] If human knowledge sufficed.      We had come, meanwhile, to the foot of the mountain; here we  found the rock so steep, that there the legs would be agile in  vain. Between Lerici and Turbia[1] the most deserted, the most  secluded way is a stair easy and open, compared with that. \"Now  who knows on which hand the hillside slopes,\" said my Master,  staying his step, \"so that he can ascend who goeth without  wings?\"    [1] Lerici on the Gulf of Spezzia, and Turbia, just above Monaco,  are at the two ends of the Riviera; between them the mountains  rise steeply from the shore, along which in Dante's time there  was no road.      And while he was holding his face low, questioning his mind about  the road, and I was looking up around the rock, on the left hand  appeared to me a company of souls who were moving their feet  towards us, and seemed not, so slowly were they coming. \"Lift,\"  said I to the Master, \"thine eyes, lo! on this side who will give  us counsel, if thou from thyself canst not have it.\" He looked at  them, and with air of relief, answered, \"Let us go thither, for  they come slowly, and do thou confirm thy hope, sweet son.    That people was still as far, I mean after a thousand steps of  ours, as a good thrower would cast with his hand, when they all  pressed up to the hard masses of the high bank, and stood still  and close, as one who goes in doubt stops to look.[1] \"O ye who  have made good ends, O spirits already elect,\" Virgil began, \"by  that peace which I believe is awaited by you all, tell us, where  the mountain lies so that the going up is possible; for to lose  time is most displeasing to him who knows most.\"    [1] They stopped, surprised, at seeing Virgil and Dante advancing  to the left, against the rule in Purgatory, where the course is  always to the right, symbolizing progress in good. In Hell the  contrary rule holds.      As the sheep come forth from the fold by ones, and twos, and  threes, and the others stand timid, holding eye and muzzle to the  ground; and what the first does the others also do, huddling  themselves to her if she stop, silly and quiet, and wherefore  know not; so I saw then moving to approach, the head of that  fortunate flock, modest in face and dignified in gait.    When those in front saw the light broken on the ground at my  right side, so that the shadow fell from me on the cliff, they  stopped, and drew somewhat back; and all the rest who were coming  behind, not knowing why, did just the same. \"Without your  asking, I confess to you that this is a human body which you see,  whereby the light of the sun on the ground is cleft. Marvel not  thereat, but believe that not without power that comes from  heaven he seeks to surmount this wall.\" Thus the Master:and that  worthy people said, \"Turn, enter in advance, then;\" with the  backs of their hands making sign. And one of them began, \"Whoever  thou art, turn thy face as thou thus goest; consider if in the  world thou didst ever see me?\" I turned me toward him, and looked  at him fixedly: blond he was, and beautiful, and of gentle  aspect, but a blow had divided one of his eyebrows.    When I had humbly disclaimed having ever seen him, he said, \"Now  look!\" and he showed me a wound at the top of his breast. Then he  said, smiling, \"I am Manfred,[1] grandson of the Empress  Constance; wherefore I pray thee, that when thou returnest, thou  go to my beautiful daughter,[2] mother of the honor of Sicily and  of Aragon, and tell to her the truth if aught else be told. After  I had my body broken by two mortal stabs, I rendered myself,  weeping, to Him who pardons willingly. Horrible were my sins, but  the Infinite Goodness has such wide arms that it takes whatever  turns to it. If the Pastor of Cosenza,[3] who was set on the hunt  of me by Clement, had then rightly read this page in God, the  bones of my body would still be at the head of the bridge near  Benevento, under the guard of the heavy cairn. Now the rain  bathes them, and the wind moves them forth from the kingdom,  almost along the Verde, whither he transferred them with  extinguished light.[4] By their [5] malediction the Eternal Love  is not so lost that it cannot return, while hope hath speck of  green. True is it, that whoso dies in contumacy of Holy Church,  though he repent him at the end, needs must stay outside[6] upon  this bank thirtyfold the whole time that he has been in his  presumption,[7] if such decree become not shorter through good  prayers. See now if thou canst make me glad, revealing to my good  Constance how thou hast seen me, and also this prohibition,[8]  for here through those on earth much is gained.\"    [1] The natural son of the Emperor Frederick II. He was born in  1231; in 1258 he was crowned King of Sicily. In 1263 Charles of  Anjou was called by Pope Urban IV. to contend against him, and in  1266 Manfred was killed at the battle of Benevento.    [2] Constance, the daughter of Manfred, was married to Peter of  Aragon. She had three sons, Alphonso, James, and Frederick.  Alphonso succeeded his father in Aragon, and James in Sicily, but  after the death of Alphonso James became King of Aragon.  and  Frederick King of Sicily. Manfred naturally speaks favorably of  them, but Dante himself thought ill of James and Frederick. See  Canto VII., towards the end.    [3] The Archbishop of Cosenza, at command of the Pope, Clement  IV., took the body of Manfred from his grave near Benevento, and  threw it unburied, as the body of one excommunicated, on the bank  of the Verde.

The value of  the prayers of the good on earth in shortening the period of  suffering of the souls in Purgatory is more than once referred to  by him, as well as the virtue of the intercession of the souls in  Purgatory for the benefit of the living.
