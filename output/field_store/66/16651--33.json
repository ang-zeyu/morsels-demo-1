The excavations conducted by the Greek Archæological Society at           Athens from 1883 to 1889 have laid bare the entire surface of           the Acropolis, and shed an unexpected light upon the early           history of Attic art. Many questions which once seemed           unanswerable are now definitively answered, and, on the other           hand, many new questions have been raised. When, in 1886,           Kabbadias and Dörpfeld unearthed the foundations of a great           temple close by the southern side of the Erechtheion, all           questions concerning the exact site, the ground-plan, and the           elevation of the great temple of Athena of the sixth century           B.C. were decided once for all.[1] On these points little or           nothing can be added to what has been done, and Dörpfeld's           results must be accepted as final and certain.             [Footnote 1: DÖRPFELD, Preliminary Report, _Mitth. Ath._, X, p.           275; Plans and restorations, _Antike Denkmäler_, I, pls. 1, 2;           Description and discussion, _Mitth. Ath._, XI, p. 337.]             The history of the temple presents, however, several questions,           some of which seem still undecided. When was the temple built?           Was it all built at one time? Was it restored after its           destruction by the Persians? Did it continue in use after the           erection of the Parthenon? Was it in existence in the days of           Pausanias? Did Pausanias mention it in his description of the           Acropolis? Conflicting answers to nearly all of these questions  Page 2   have appeared since the discovery of the temple. Only the first           question has received one and the same answer from all. The           material and the technical execution of the peripteros,           entablature, _etc._, of the temple show conclusively that this           part, at least, was erected in the time of Peisistratos.[2] We           may therefore accept so much without further discussion. Of the           walls of the cella and opisthodomos nothing remains, but the           foundations of this part are made of the hard blue limestone of           the Acropolis, while the foundations of the outer part are of           reddish-gray limestone from the Peiraieus. The foundations of           the cella are also less accurately laid than those of the           peripteros. These differences lead Dörpfeld to assume that the           naos itself (the building contained within the peristyle)           existed before the time of Peisistratos, although he does not           deny the possibility that builders of one date may have           employed different materials and methods, as convenience or           economy dictated.[3] Positive proof is not to be hoped for in           the absence of the upper walls of the naos, but probability is           in favor of Dörpfeld's assumption, that the naos is older than           the peristyle, _etc._[4] It is further certain, that this           temple was called in the sixth century B.C. [Greek: to           Ecatômpedon]( see below p. 9). So far, we have the most           positive possible evidence--that of the remains of the temple           itself and the inscription giving its name. The evidence           regarding the subsequent history of the temple is not so           simple.             [Footnote 2: DÖRPFELD, _Mitth. Ath._, XI, p. 349.]             [Footnote 3: _Mitth. Ath._, XI, p. 345.]             [Footnote 4: On the other hand, see PETERSEN, _Mitth. Ath._,           XII, p. 66.]             Dörpfeld (_Mitth. Ath._, XII, p. 25 ff.) arrives at the           following conclusions: (1) The temple was restored after the           departure of the Persians; (2) it was injured by fire B.C. 406;           (3) it was repaired and continued in use; (4) it was seen and           described by Pausanias I. 24.3 in a lost passage. Let us take           up these points in inverse order. The passage of Pausanias           reads in our texts:--[Greek: Lelectai de moi kai proteron           (17.1), ôs Athenaiois perissoteron ti e tois allois es ta theia           esti spoudes, prôtoi men gar Athenan eponomasan Erganen prôtoi           d'acôlous Ermas... omou de sphisin en tô naô Spoudaiôn daimôn           estin.] Dörpfeld marks a lacuna between  [Greek: Ermas] and  Page 3   [Greek; omou], as do those editors who do not supply a           recommendation. Dörpfeld, however, thinks the gap is far greater           than has been supposed, including certainly the mention and           probably the full description of the temple under discussion.           His reasons are in substance about as follows: (1) Pausanias has           reached a point in his periegesis where he would naturally           mention this temple, because he is standing beside it,[5] and           (2) the phrase [Greek: omou de sphisin en tô naô Spoudaiôn           estin] implies that a temple has just been mentioned. These           are, at least, the main arguments, those deduced from the           passage following the description of the Erechtheion being           merely accessory.

The economy rebounded in 1993-95 after a severe depression  accompanying the collapse of the previous centrally planned system in  1990 and 1991. However, a weakening of government resolve to maintain  stabilization policies in the election year of 1996 contributed to  renewal of inflationary pressures, spurred by the budget deficit which  exceeded 12%. The collapse of financial pyramid schemes in early  1997-which had attracted deposits from a substantial portion of  Albania's adult population - triggered severe social unrest which led  to more than 1,500 deaths, widespread destruction of property, and an  8% drop in GDP. The new government installed in July 1997 has taken  strong measures to restore public order and to revive economic  activity and trade. The economy continues to be bolstered by  remittances of some 20% of the labor force which works abroad, mostly  in Greece and Italy. These remittances supplement GDP and help offset  the large foreign trade deficit. Most agricultural land was privatized  in 1992, substantially improving peasant incomes.
