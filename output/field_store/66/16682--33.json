It is, indeed, the season of regenerated feeling--the  season for kindling, not merely the fire of hospitality in the hall, but  the genial flame of charity in the heart.    The scene of early love again rises green to memory beyond the sterile  waste of years; and the idea of home, fraught with the fragrance of  home-dwelling joys, re-animates the drooping spirit,--as the Arabian  breeze will sometimes waft the freshness of the distant fields to the  weary pilgrim of the desert.    Stranger and sojourner as I am in the land--though for me no social  hearth may blaze, no hospitable roof throw open its doors, nor the warm  grasp of friendship welcome me at the threshold--yet I feel the  influence of the season beaming into my soul from the happy looks of  those around me. Surely happiness is reflective, like the light of  heaven; and every countenance, bright with smiles, and glowing with  innocent enjoyment, is a mirror transmitting to others the rays of a  supreme and ever-shining benevolence. He who can turn churlishly away  from contemplating the felicity of his fellow-beings, and sit down  darkling and repining in his loneliness when all around is joyful, may  have his moments of strong excitement and selfish gratification, but he  wants the genial and social sympathies which constitute the charm of a  merry Christmas.

[Illustration]    In the course of a December tour in Yorkshire, I rode for a long  distance in one of the public coaches, on the day preceding Christmas.  The coach was crowded, both inside and out, with passengers, who, by  their talk, seemed principally bound to the mansions of relations or  friends to eat the Christmas dinner. It was loaded also with hampers of  game, and baskets and boxes of delicacies; and hares hung dangling their  long ears about the coachman's box,--presents from distant friends for  the impending feast. I had three fine rosy-cheeked schoolboys for my  fellow-passengers inside, full of the buxom health and manly spirit  which I have observed in the children of this country. They were  returning home for the holidays in high glee, and promising themselves a  world of enjoyment. It was delightful to hear the gigantic plans of  pleasure of the little rogues, and the impracticable feats they were to  perform during their six weeks' emancipation from the abhorred thraldom  of book, birch, and pedagogue. They were full of anticipations of the  meeting with the family and household, down to the very cat and dog; and  of the joy they were to give their little sisters by the presents with  which their pockets were crammed; but the meeting to which they seemed  to look forward with the greatest impatience was with Bantam, which I  found to be a pony, and, according to their talk, possessed of more  virtues than any steed since the days of Bucephalus. How he could trot!  how he could run! and then such leaps as he would take--there was not a  hedge in the whole country that he could not clear.    They were under the particular guardianship of the coachman, to whom,  whenever an opportunity presented, they addressed a host of questions,  and pronounced him one of the best fellows in the whole world. Indeed, I  could not but notice the more than ordinary air of bustle and  importance of the coachman, who wore his hat a little on one side, and  had a large bunch of Christmas greens stuck in the button-hole of his  coat. He is always a personage full of mighty care and business, but he  is particularly so during this season, having so many commissions to  execute in consequence of the great interchange of presents. And here,  perhaps, it may not be unacceptable to my untravelled readers, to have a  sketch that may serve as a general representation of this very numerous  and important class of functionaries, who have a dress, a manner, a  language, an air, peculiar to themselves, and prevalent throughout the  fraternity; so that, wherever an English stage-coachman may be seen, he  cannot be mistaken for one of any other craft or mystery.    [Illustration]    He has commonly a broad, full face, curiously mottled with red, as if  the blood had been forced by hard feeding into every vessel of the skin;  he is swelled into jolly dimensions by frequent potations of malt  liquors, and his bulk is still further increased by a multiplicity of  coats, in which he is buried like a cauliflower, the upper one reaching  to his heels. He wears a broad-brimmed, low-crowned hat; a huge roll of  coloured handkerchief about his neck, knowingly knotted and tucked in  at the bosom; and has in summer-time a large bouquet of flowers in his  button-hole; the present, most probably, of some enamoured country lass.  His waistcoat is commonly of some bright colour, striped; and his  small-clothes extend far below the knees, to meet a pair of jockey boots  which reach about half-way up his legs.    [Illustration]    All this costume is maintained with much precision; he has a pride in  having his clothes of excellent materials; and, notwithstanding the  seeming grossness of his appearance, there is still discernible that  neatness and propriety of person, which is almost inherent in an  Englishman. He enjoys great consequence and consideration along the  road; has frequent conferences with the village housewives, who look  upon him as a man of great trust and dependence; and he seems to have a  good understanding with every bright-eyed country lass. The moment he  arrives where the horses are to be changed, he throws down the reins  with something of an air, and abandons the cattle to the care of the  ostler; his duty being merely to drive from one stage to another. When  off the box, his hands are thrust in the pockets of his greatcoat, and  he rolls about the inn-yard with an air of the most absolute  lordliness. Here he is generally surrounded by an admiring throng of  ostlers, stable-boys, shoe-blacks, and those nameless hangers-on that  infest inns and taverns, and run errands, and do all kinds of odd jobs,  for the privilege of battening on the drippings of the kitchen and the  leakage of the tap-room. These all look up to him as to an oracle;  treasure up his cant phrases; echo his opinions about horses and other  topics of jockey lore; and, above all, endeavour to imitate his air and  carriage. Every ragamuffin that has a coat to his back thrusts his hands  in the pockets, rolls in his gait, talks slang, and is an embryo  Coachey.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    Perhaps it might be owing to the pleasing serenity that reigned in my  own mind, that I fancied I saw cheerfulness in every countenance  throughout the journey. A stage coach, however, carries animation always  with it, and puts the world in motion as it whirls along. The horn  sounded at the entrance of a village, produces a general bustle. Some  hasten forth to meet friends; some with bundles and bandboxes to secure  places, and in the hurry of the moment can hardly take leave of the  group that accompanies them. In the meantime, the coachman has a world  of small commissions to execute. Sometimes he delivers a hare or  pheasant; sometimes jerks a small parcel or newspaper to the door of a  public-house; and sometimes, with knowing leer and words of sly import,  hands to some half-blushing, half-laughing housemaid an odd-shaped  billet-doux from some rustic admirer. As the coach rattles through the  village, every one runs to the window, and you have glances on every  side of fresh country faces, and blooming giggling girls. At the corners  are assembled juntas of village idlers and wise men, who take their  stations there for the important purpose of seeing company pass; but the  sagest knot is generally at the blacksmith's, to whom the passing of the  coach is an event fruitful of much speculation. The smith, with the  horse's heel in his lap, pauses as the vehicle whirls by; the Cyclops  round the anvil suspend their ringing hammers, and suffer the iron to  grow cool; and the sooty spectre in brown paper cap, labouring at the  bellows, leans on the handle for a moment, and permits the asthmatic  engine to heave a long-drawn sigh, while he glares through the murky  smoke and sulphureous gleams of the smithy.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    Perhaps the impending holiday might have given a more than usual  animation to the country, for it seemed to me as if everybody was in  good looks and good spirits. Game, poultry, and other luxuries of the  table, were in brisk circulation in the villages; the grocers',  butchers', and fruiterers' shops were thronged with customers. The  housewives were stirring briskly about, putting their dwellings in  order; and the glossy branches of holly, with their bright red berries,  began to appear at the windows. The scene brought to mind an old  writer's account of Christmas preparations:--\"Now capons and hens,  besides turkeys, geese, and ducks, with beef and mutton--must all die;  for in twelve days a multitude of people will not be fed with a little.  Now plums and spice, sugar and honey, square it"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2066"],[0,"Wildfire (#3)"],[1,"at father and daughter.    \"So you're back again?\" she queried, severely.    \"Sure, Auntie,\" replied the girl, complacently.    \"You ran off to get out of seeing Wetherby, didn't you?\"    Lucy stared sweetly at her aunt.    \"He was waiting for hours,\" went on the worthy woman. \"I never saw a  man in such a stew.... No wonder, playing fast and loose with him the  way you do.\"    \"I told him No!\" flashed Lucy.    \"But Wetherby's not the kind to take no. And I'm not satisfied to let  you mean it. Lucy Bostil, you don't know your mind an hour straight  running. You've fooled enough with these riders of your Dad's. If  you're not careful you'll marry one of them.... One of these wild  riders! As bad as a Ute Indian! ... Wetherby is young and he idolizes  you. In all common sense why don't you take him?\"    \"I don't care for him,\" replied Lucy.    \"You like him as well as anybody.... John Bostil, what do you say? You  approved of Wetherby. I heard you tell him Lucy was like an unbroken  colt and that you'd--\"    \"Sure, I like Jim,\" interrupted Bostil; and he avoided Lucy's swift  look.    \"Well?\" demanded his sister.    Evidently Bostil found himself in a corner between two fires. He looked  sheepish, then disgusted.    \"Dad!\" exclaimed Lucy, reproachfully.    \"See here, Jane,\" said Bostil, with an air of finality, \"the girl is of  age to-day--an' she can do what she damn pleases!\"    \"That's a fine thing for you to say,\" retorted Aunt Jane. \"Like as not  she'll be fetching that hang-dog Joel Creech up here for you to  support.\"    \"Auntie!\" cried Lucy, her eyes blazing.    \"Oh, child, you torment me--worry me so,\" said the disappointed woman.  \"It's all for your sake.... Look at you, Lucy Bostil! A girl of  eighteen who comes of a family! And you riding around and going around  as you are now--in a man's clothes!\"    \"But, you dear old goose, I can't ride in a woman's skirt,\"  expostulated Lucy. \"Mind you, Auntie, I can RIDE!\"    \"Lucy, if I live here forever I'd never get reconciled to a Bostil  woman in leather pants. We Bostils were somebody once, back in  Missouri.\"    Bostil laughed. \"Yes, an' if I hadn't hit the trail west we'd be  starvin' yet. Jane, you're a sentimental old fool. Let the girl alone  an' reconcile yourself to this wilderness.\"    Aunt Jane's eyes were wet with tears. Lucy, seeing them, ran to her and  hugged and kissed her.    \"Auntie, I will promise--from to-day--to have some dignity. I've been  free as a boy in these rider clothes. As I am now the men never seem to  regard me as a girl. Somehow that's better. I can't explain, but I like  it. My dresses are what have caused all the trouble. I know that. But  if I'm grown up--if it's so tremendous--then I'll wear a dress all the  time, except just WHEN I ride. Will that do, Auntie?\"    \"Maybe you will grow up, after all,\" replied Aunt Jane, evidently  surprised and pleased.    Then Lucy with clinking spurs ran away to her room.    \"Jane, what's this nonsense about young Joel Creech?\" asked Bostil,  gruffly.    \"I don't know any more than is gossiped. That I told you. Have you ever  asked Lucy about him?\"    \"I sure haven't,\" said Bostil, bluntly.    \"Well, ask her. If she tells you at all she'll tell the truth. Lucy'd  never sleep at night if she lied.\"    Aunt Jane returned to her housewifely tasks, leaving Bostil  thoughtfully stroking the hound and watching the fire. Presently Lucy  returned--a different Lucy--one that did not rouse his rider's pride,  but thrilled his father's heart. She had been a slim, lithe, supple,  disheveled boy, breathing the wild spirit of the open and the horse she  rode. She was now a girl in the graceful roundness of her slender form,  with hair the gold of the sage at sunset, and eyes the blue of the deep  haze of distance, and lips the sweet red of the upland rose. And all  about her seemed different.    \"Lucy--you look--like--like she used to be,\" said Bostil, unsteadily.    \"My mother!\" murmured Lucy.    But these two, so keen, so strong, so alive, did not abide long with  sad memories.    \"Lucy, I want to ask you somethin',\" said Bostil, presently. \"What  about this young Joel Creech?\"    Lucy started as if suddenly recalled, then she laughed merrily. \"Dad,  you old fox, did you see him ride out after me?\"    \"No. I was just askin' on--on general principles.\"    \"What do you mean?\"    \"Lucy, is there anythin' between you an' Joel?\" he asked, gravely.    \"No,\" she replied, with her clear eyes up to his.    Bostil thought of a bluebell. \"I'm beggin' your pardon,\" he said,  hastily.    \"Dad, you know how Joel runs after me. I've told you. I let him till  lately. I liked him. But that wasn't why. I felt sorry for him--pitied  him.\"    \"You did? Seems an awful waste,\" replied Bostil.    \"Dad, I don't believe Joel is--perfectly right in his mind,\" Lucy said,  solemnly.    \"Haw! haw! Fine compliments you're payin' yourself.\"    \"Listen. I'm serious. I mean I've grown to see---looking back--that a  slow, gradual change has come over Joel since he was kicked in the head  by a mustang. I'm sure no one else has noticed it.\"    \"Goin' batty over you. That's no unusual sign round this here camp.  Look at--\"    \"We're talking about Joel Creech. Lately he has done some queer things.  To-day, for instance. I thought I gave him the slip. But he must have  been watching. Anyway, to my surprise he showed up on Peg. He doesn't  often get Peg across the river. He said the feed was getting scarce  over there. I was dying to race Buckles against Peg, but I remembered  you wouldn't like that.\"    \"I should say not,\" said Bostil, darkly.    \"Well, Joel caught up to me--and he wasn't nice at all. He was worse  to-day. We quarreled. I said I'd bet he'd never follow me again and he  said he'd bet he would. Then he got sulky and hung back. I rode away,  glad to be rid of him, and I climbed to a favorite place of mine. On my  way home I saw Peg grazing on the rim of the creek, near that big  spring-hole where the water's so deep and clear. And what do you think?  There was Joel's head above the water. I remembered in our quarrel I  had told him to go wash his dirty face. He was doing it. I had to  laugh. When he saw me--he--then--then he--\" Lucy faltered, blushing  with anger and shame.    \"Well, what then?\" demanded Bostil, quietly.    \"He called, 'Hey, Luce--take off your clothes and come in for a swim!'\"    Bostil swore.    \"I tell you I was mad,\" continued Lucy, \"and just as surprised. That  was one of the queer things. But never before had he dared to--to-\"    \"Insult you. Then what 'd you do?\" interrupted Bostil, curiously.    \"I yelled, 'I'll fix you, Joel Creech!'... His clothes were in a pile  on the bank. At first I thought I'd throw them in the water, but when I  got to them I thought of something better. I took up all but his shoes,  for I remembered the ten miles of rock and cactus between him and home,  and I climbed up on Buckles. Joel screamed and swore something fearful.  But I didn't look back. And Peg, you know--maybe you don't know--but  Peg is fond of me, and he followed me, straddling his bridle all the  way in. I dropped Joel's clothes down the ridge a ways, right in the  trail, so he can't miss them. And that's all.... Dad, was it--was it  very bad?\"    \"Bad! Why, you ought to have thrown your gun on him. At least bounced a  rock off his head! But say, Lucy, after all, maybe you've done enough.  I guess you never thought of it.\"    \"What?\"    \"The sun is hot to-day. Hot! An' if Joel's as crazy an' mad as you say  he'll not have sense enough to stay in the water or shade till the  sun's gone down. An' if he tackles that ten miles before he'll sunburn  himself within an inch of his life.\"    \"Sunburn? Oh, Dad! I'm sorry,\" burst out Lucy, contritely. \"I never  thought of that. I'll ride back with his clothes.\"    \"You will not,\" said Bostil.    \"Let me send some one, then,\" she entreated.    \"Girl, haven't you the nerve to play your own game? Let Creech get his  lesson. He deserves it.... An' now, Lucy, I've two more questions to  ask.\"    \"Only two?\" she queried, archly. \"Dad, don't scold me with questions.\"    \"What shall I say to Wetherby for good an' all?\"    Lucy's eyes shaded dreamily, and she seemed to look beyond the room,  out over the ranges.    \"Tell him to go back to Durango and forget the foolish girl who can  care only for the desert and a horse.\"    \"All right. That is straight talk, like an Indian's. An' now the last  question--what do you want for a birthday present?\"    \"Oh, of course,\" she cried, gleefully clapping her hands. \"I'd  forgotten that. I'm eighteen!\"    \"You get that old chest of your mother's. But what from me?\"    \"Dad, will you give me anything I ask for?\"    \"Yes, my girl.\"    \"Anything--any HORSE?\"    Lucy knew his weakness, for she had inherited it.    \"Sure; any horse but the King.\"    \"How about Sarchedon?\"    \"Why, Lucy, what'd you do with that big black devil? He's too high.  Seventeen hands high! You couldn't mount him.\"    \"Pooh! Sarch KNEELS for me.\"    \"Child, listen to reason. Sarch would pull your arms out of their  sockets.\"    \"He has got an iron jaw,\" agreed Lucy. \"Well, then--how about Dusty  Ben?\" She was tormenting her father and she did it with glee.    \"No--not Ben. He's the faithfulest hoss I ever owned. It wouldn't be  fair to part with him, even to you. Old associations ... a rider's  loyalty ... now, Lucy, you know--\"    \"Dad, you're afraid I'd train and love Ben into beating the King. Some  day I'll ride some horse out in front of the gray. Remember, Dad! ...  Then give me Two Face.\"    \"Sure not her, Lucy. Thet mare can't be trusted. Look why we named her  Two Face.\"    \"Buckles, then, dear generous Daddy who longs to give his grown-up girl  ANYTHING!\"    \"Lucy, can't you be satisfied an' happy with your mustangs? You've got  a dozen. You can have any others on the range. Buckles ain't safe for  you to ride.\"    Bostil was notably the most"]]]
