In Germany this origin of  the township was furthered by Charles the Great, who established  schools and other civil institutions, with a magistrate at their head,  round many of the palace-castles that he founded. \"A new epoch,\" says  Von Maurer, \"begins with the villa-foundations of Charles the Great  and his ordinances respecting them, for that his celebrated  capitularies in this connection were intended for his newly  established villas is self-evident. In that proceeding he obviously  had the Roman villa in his mind, and on the model of this he rather  further developed the previously existing court and villa constitution  than completely reorganized it. Hence one finds even in his new  creations the old foundation again, albeit on a far more extended  plan, the economical side of such villa-colonies being especially more  completely and effectively ordered.\"[2] The expression \"Palatine,\" as  applied to certain districts, bears testimony to the fact here  referred to. As above said, the development of the township was  everywhere on the same lines. The aim of the civic community was  always to remove as far as possible the power which controlled them.  Their worst condition was when they were immediately overshadowed by a  territorial magnate. When their immediate lord was a prince, the area  of whose feudal jurisdiction was more extensive, his rule was less  oppressively felt, and their condition was therefore considerably  improved. It was only, however, when cities were \"free of the empire\"  (_Reichsfrei_) that they attained the ideal of mediaeval civic freedom.    It follows naturally from the conditions described that there was, in  the first place, a conflict between the primitive inhabitants as  embodied in their corporate society and the territorial lord, whoever  he might be. No sooner had the township acquired a charter of freedom  or certain immunities than a new antagonism showed itself between the  ancient corporation of the city and the trade-guilds, these  representing the later accretions. The territorial lord (if any) now  sided, usually though not always, with the patrician party. But the  guilds, nevertheless, succeeded in ultimately wresting many of the  leading public offices from the exclusive possession of the patrician  families. Meanwhile the leading men of the guilds had become _hommes  arrives_. They had acquired wealth, and influence which was in many  cases hereditary in their family, and by the beginning of the  sixteenth century they were confronted with the more or less veiled  and more or less open opposition of the smaller guildsmen and of the  newest comers into the city, the shiftless proletariat of serfs and  free peasants, whom economic pressure was fast driving within the  walls, owing to the changed conditions of the times.    The peasant of the period was of three kinds: the _leibeigener_ or  serf, who was little better than a slave, who cultivated his lord's  domain, upon whom unlimited burdens might be fixed, and who was in all  respects amenable to the will of his lord; the _hoeriger_ or villein,  whose services were limited alike in kind and amount; and the _freier_  or free peasant, who merely paid what was virtually a quit-rent in  kind or in money for being allowed to retain his holding or status in  the rural community under the protection of the manorial lord. The  last was practically the counterpart of the mediaeval English  copyholder. The Germans had undergone essentially the same  transformations in social organization as the other populations of  Europe.    The barbarian nations at the time of their great migration in the  fifth century were organized on a tribal and village basis. The head  man was simply _primus inter pares_. In the course of their wanderings  the successful military leader acquired powers and assumed a position  that was unknown to the previous times, when war, such as it was, was  merely inter-tribal and inter-clannish, and did not involve the  movements of peoples and federations of tribes, and when, in  consequence, the need of permanent military leaders or for the  semblance of a military hierarchy had not arisen. The military leader  now placed himself at the head of the older social organization, and  associated with his immediate followers on terms approaching equality.  A well-known illustration of this is the incident of the vase taken  from the Cathedral of Rheims, and of Chlodowig's efforts to rescue it  from his independent comrade-in-arms.    The process of the development of the feudal polity of the Middle Ages  is, of course, a very complicated one, owing to the various strands  that go to compose it. In addition to the German tribes themselves,  who moved _en masse_, carrying with them their tribal and village  organization, under the overlordship of the various military leaders,  were the indigenous inhabitants amongst whom they settled. The latter  in the country districts, even in many of the territories within the  Roman Empire, still largely retained the primitive communal  organization. The new-comers, therefore, found in the rural  communities a social system already in existence into which they  naturally fitted, but as an aristocratic body over against the  conquered inhabitants. The latter, though not all reduced to a servile  condition, nevertheless held their land from the conquering body under  conditions which constituted them an order of freemen inferior to the  new-comers.    To put the matter briefly, the military leaders developed into barons  and princes, and in some cases the nominal centralization culminated,  as in France and England, in the kingly office; while, in Germany and  Italy, it took the form of the revived Imperial office, the spiritual  overlord of the whole of Christendom being the Pope, who had his  vassals in the prince-prelates and subordinate ecclesiastical holders.  In addition to the princes sprung originally from the military leaders  of the migratory nations, there were their free followers, who  developed ultimately into the knighthood or inferior nobility; the  inhabitants of the conquered districts forming a distinct class of  inferior freemen or of serfs. But the essentially personal relation  with which the whole process started soon degenerated into one based  on property. The most primitive form of property--land--was at the  outset what was termed _allodial_, at least among the conquering  race, from every social group having the possession, under the  trusteeship of his head man, of the land on which it settled. Now,  owing to the necessities of the time, owing to the need of protection,  to violence, and to religious motives, it passed into the hands of the  overlord, temporal or spiritual, as his possession; and the  inhabitants, even in the case of populations which had not been  actually conquered, became his vassals, villeins, or serfs, as the  case might be. The process by means of which this was accomplished was  more or less gradual; indeed, the entire extinction of communal  rights, whereby the notion of private ownership is fully realized, was  not universally effected even in the West of Europe till within a  measurable distance of our own time.[3]    From the foregoing it will be understood that the oppression of the  peasant, under the feudalism of the Middle Ages, and especially of the  later Middle Ages, was viewed by him as an infringement of his rights.  During the period of time constituting mediaeval history, the peasant,  though he often slumbered, yet often started up to a sudden  consciousness of his position. The memory of primitive communism was  never quite extinguished, and the continual peasant-revolts of the  Middle Ages, though immediately occasioned, probably, by some fresh  invasion, by which it was sought to tear from the \"common man\" yet  another shred of his surviving rights, always had in the background  the ideal, vague though it may have been, of his ancient freedom.  Such, undoubtedly, was the meaning of the Jacquerie in France, with  its wild and apparently senseless vengeance; of the Wat Tyler revolt  in England, with its systematic attempt to envisage the vague  tradition of the primitive village community in the legends of the  current ecclesiastical creed; of the numerous revolts in Flanders and  North Germany; to a large extent of the Hussite movement in Bohemia,  under Ziska; of the rebellion led by George Doza in Hungary; and, as  we shall see in the body of the present work, of the social movements  of Reformation Germany, in which, with the partial exception of Ket's  rebellion in England a few years later, we may consider them as  virtually coming to an end.    For the movements in question were distinctly the last of their kind.  The civil wars of religion in France, and the great rebellion in  England against Charles I, which also assumed a religious colouring,  open a new era in popular revolts. In the latter, particularly, we  have clearly before us the attempt of the new middle class of town and  country, the independent citizen, and the now independent yeoman, to  assert supremacy over the old feudal estates or orders. The new  conditions had swept away the special revolutionary tradition of the  mediaeval period, whose golden age lay in the past with its  communal-holding and free men with equal rights on the basis of the  village organization--rights which with every century the peasant felt  more and more slipping away from him. The place of this tradition was  now taken by an ideal of individual freedom, apart from any social  bond, and on a basis merely political, the way for which had been  prepared by that very conception of individual proprietorship on the  part of the landlord, against which the older revolutionary sentiment  had protested. A most powerful instrument in accommodating men's minds  to this change of view, in other words, to the establishment of the  new individualistic "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20464"],[0,"A Journey Through France in War Time (#3)"],[1,"become  somewhat acquainted. Addresses were made by Mr. Herr and others  connected with the launching of the enterprise. We were told to be  neutral, and this was emphasized by the chairman from the day of sailing  until the journey was over. I received this admonition with a decided  mental reservation. It impressed me as being incongruous and entirely  out of place for a delegation of Americans to plan a visit to France and  not be in accord with that sorely stricken people. It occurred to me  also, then and there, that if the Commission expected to accomplish its  object it would be necessary to show a genuine sympathy with the Allied  cause, and I acted on this theory during the entire journey. A majority  of the members cherished the same sentiments, which most of them managed  to conceal with more or less success.    Arriving at the dock of the Compagne General Transatlantique, soon after  noon on Saturday, August 26th, an inspection of the luggage was made.  This was a tedious and thorough process, requiring the unpacking and  repacking of all the contents of the trunks and valises, thereby  insuring the absence of dynamite, bombs and other destructive material.  Numerous devoted friends were on hand to say good bye and \"bon voyage\",  but they were permitted only on the dock.    Passports were carefully examined by a group of inspectors and the  voyagers were permitted to go on board the waiting steamer.    The members of the Commission were next grouped together, photographed  and motion-pictured, thus beginning the publicity considered necessary  for the success of the enterprise.    The departure of the Lafayette was a stirring affair. Promptly at three  o'clock P. M. the vessel moved away from her moorings, amidst the din of  the band, the waving of flags, the whir of the movie machine, the  blowing of whistles and the cheers of friends of the passengers.    Soon after sailing the members of the Commission were formally  introduced to each other and, strange to relate, with but a single  exception, no two of the party had ever met before beginning the  journey.    It was discovered that several of the commissioners--myself not among  the number, spoke excellent French. This proved a great advantage to the  French-speaking members during the journey and, incidentally, to the  members who understood English only.    Among the passengers aboard and attached to the Commission was Mr.  Harrison Reeves, a noted war correspondent, formerly connected with The  New York Sun. He had been several times at the Front in France in a  representative capacity, had lived a number of years in France, spoke  and wrote the French language fluently and has a fine personality. His  presence was much appreciated, his knowledge of recent events in France  and his large acquaintance with men of affairs proving invaluable to the  commissioners.    On Monday, August 28th, a meeting of the Commissioners was called for  organization and consultation. At this meeting various committees were  agreed upon and appointed by the chairman. It was also arranged that  daily sessions were to be held and the work of the commission laid out  so far as possible in advance.    The chairman had prepared an address outlining the duties of the  Commission, which is here reproduced.    * * *    Aboard Steamship \"Lafayette\"  En-route to France,    August 28th, 1916.    To the Members of the  American Industrial Commission to France.    Gentlemen:    We are bound on an errand of constructive friendship. Through the  encouragement of the authorities of France and the public spirit of  American business men, we are enabled to go on this mission of good  will and service.    France, in her griefs and her joys, is always a land of  inspiration; she is the classic creator and promoter of the arts  which make for civilization. In many ways American life is the  richer because France exists.    What greater service can a representative company of thinking  Americans render to their land than to visit and touch at first  hand the sources of so much that is valuable to the world, and to  carry home lessons and messages which may easily be potent in  forming stronger ties in the old time intimate relationship between  our country and France.    Primarily, we go, then, to learn in meeting our oversea friends  face to face, and, if our errand succeeds, to be of any service  possible. The great question then becomes: how can we serve best?  By keeping our eyes, ears, minds and spirits open and alert to the  facts and the possibilities founded on such facts which unfold  before us in the course of our visit. Our trip has been announced  as an investigation or survey of the industrial situation in  France.    Our mission appears to be to examine the present economic life and  activities in France, and, in a study of such life as we find it,  endeavor to ascertain what the future is likely to bring forth for  industrial France.    It is obvious that an intelligent examination of the rich economic  development of France must yield valuable byproducts of observation  and instruction. The human values in this economic structure are of  fundamental importance; civil, social and general economic progress  proceeding from the French economic effort will be of wide interest  to us.    Undoubtedly in the coming years France will make extraordinary  strides in industrial progress. She is planning--indeed has already  under way, many projects of manufacture, transportation, housing,  labor-conservation and municipal life; projects of deep interest  and importance to every American business man and citizen. It may  be our special privilege to be taken behind the scenes of this  tremendous expansion, see some of the beginnings and, if we are  fortunate, to make such contribution as France may desire from the  good will, experience and certain peculiar knowledge we can offer  for her use in any way that may enable her to attain the end she  seeks.    In this commission we represent something more than a body of men  who have been selected because of special distinction in fields of  their own. Each commissioner touches large circles of interest and  capacity. If the opportunity comes to us to indicate to French  business up-builders how to come into sympathetic working relations  with the enterprise and progressive affairs of our own country, we  shall achieve the high purpose of our Commission.    (Signed) W. W. NICHOLS,    Chairman of the Commission.    * * *    Before leaving New York a handsome booklet had been prepared and  printed. The brochure contained the names of the commissioners, their  public records, halftone portraits and a carefully prepared statement of  the objects of the expedition. Twenty-five hundred copies were printed  and were to be delivered on board the Lafayette by the printer. After  sailing, it was discovered by a thorough search that the much needed  booklets were not on board. These documents were for distribution after  our arrival in France and were sorely missed.    Subsequently the booklet was produced in Paris, but in somewhat  different form, and it was near the end of the journey before the  duplicate copies were ready for distribution. The loss of the American  made edition was a serious handicap.    A word or two about the personnel of the Commission. Mr. Nichols, the  chairman, is a man about sixty with a grave, clerical appearance,  formerly a professor or teacher and at one time superintendent of the  Chicago Telephone Company. A man of various business experiences, at  present connected with the Allis Chalmers Company in its New York  office. He is excessively cautious and delivered a daily lecture on  neutrality, fearing evidently that some of the members might break away  from his idea of being strictly neutral and thus thwart or defeat the  objects of the Commission. Mr. Nichols is thoroughly honest and  conscientious; he had the success of the venture very much at heart and  labored from his viewpoint to that end, priding himself in his broken  French.    Mr. John R. MacArthur was a member of the Philippine Commission, is a  fine French scholar, a ready conversationalist in both English and  French, and has a keen sense of humor. He was a constant help to the  non-French speaking members of the Commission.    Dr. Mailloux is an electrical engineer of established reputation and  large experience. He had been in previous commissions to all parts of  the world; a thorough French scholar, he had lived many years in France  and had done much work for the French Government. His knowledge of the  French people was invaluable to some of his fellow commissioners but was  not utilized to its full extent.    Mr. Edward A. Warren, of Boston, represented the textile industry and is  well posted in that line. He was the modest man of the commission,  rarely asserting himself and deferring too much to the views of his  companions. He is possessed of rare good common sense, but, as stated,  kept himself too much in the background, thereby lessening his influence  in the work of the commission.    Mr. James A. Sague, at one time vice-president of The American  Locomotive Company; is a technically educated man, genial and  companionable, and was a useful personage on the commission.    Mr. A. B. Farquhar, is a real veteran of the Civil War, nearly eighty  years of age but possessing remarkable physical vigor. He was the  friend of Lincoln, heard the Gettysburg address delivered, saved his  town (York, Pennsylvania) from destruction by the Confederates, and had  much to do with the reconstruction period after the War. He labored  under the difficulty of defective eyesight, this somewhat impairing his  usefulness on the Commission.    Mr. N. B. Hoggson, a gentleman of infinite jest, genial and persuasive;  a great mixer and constant worker, proved a very useful member of the  commission in diving after facts and making notes thereof.
