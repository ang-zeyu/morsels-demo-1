Don't you feel now as though you were ready to move mountains? I do.  What a dear old nurse Nature is! How she pets us, and gives us the best  of her treasures!\"    Her happiness invaded Oswald Everard's soul, and he felt like a  school-boy once more, rejoicing in a fine day and his liberty, with  nothing to spoil the freshness of the air, and nothing to threaten the  freedom of the moment.    \"Is it not good to live?\" he cried. \"Yes, indeed it is, if we know how  to enjoy.\"    They had come upon some haymakers, and the little girl hastened up to  help them, laughing and talking to the women, and helping them to pile  up the hay on the shoulders of a broad-backed man, who then conveyed his  burden to a pear-shaped stack. Oswald Everard watched his companion for  a moment, and then, quite forgetting his dignity as an amateur tenor  singer, he too lent his aid, and did not leave off until his companion  sank exhausted on the ground.    \"Oh,\" she laughed, \"what delightful work for a very short time! Come  along; let us go into that brown chatlet yonder and ask for some milk.  I am simply parched with thirst. Thank you, but I prefer to carry my own  flowers.\"    \"What an independent little lady you are!\" he said.    \"It is quite necessary in our profession, I can assure you,\" she  said, with a tone of mischief in her voice. \"That reminds me that my  profession is evidently not looked upon with any favour by the visitors  at the hotel. I am heartbroken to think that I have not won the esteem  of that lady in the billycock hat. What will she say to you for coming  out with me? And what will she say of me for allowing you to come? I  wonder whether she will say, 'How unfeminine!' I wish I could hear her!\"    \"I don't suppose you care,\" he said. \"You seem to be a wild little  bird.\"    \"I don't care what a person of that description says,\" replied his  companion.    \"What on earth made you contradict the major at dinner last night?\" he  asked. \"I was not at the table, but some one told me of the incident;  and I felt very sorry about it. What could you know of Miss Thyra  Flowerdew?\"    \"Well, considering that she is in my profession, of course I know  something about her,\" said the little girl.    \"Confound it all!\" he said, rather rudely. \"Surely there is some  difference between the bellows-blower and the organist.\"    \"Absolutely none,\" she answered; \"merely a variation of the original  theme!\"    As she spoke she knocked at the door of the chalet, and asked the old  dame to give them some milk. They sat in the _Stube_, and the little  girl looked about, and admired the spinning-wheel and the quaint chairs  and the queer old jugs and the pictures on the walls.    \"Ah, but you shall see the other room,\" the old peasant woman said; and  she led them into a small apartment which was evidently intended for a  study. It bore evidences of unusual taste and care, and one could see  that some loving hand had been trying to make it a real sanctum of  refinement. There was even a small piano. A carved book-rack was  fastened to the wall.    The old dame did not speak at first; she gave her guests time to recover  from the astonishment which she felt they must be experiencing; then she  pointed proudly to the piano.    \"I bought that for my daughters,\" she said, with a strange mixture of  sadness and triumph. \"I wanted to keep them at home with me, and I saved  and saved, and got enough money to buy the piano. They had always wanted  to have one, and I thought they would then stay with me. They liked  music and books, and I knew they would be glad to have a room of their  own where they might read and play and study; and so I gave them this  corner.\"    \"Well, mother,\" asked the little girl, \"and where are they this  afternoon?\"    \"Ah,\" she answered sadly, \"they did not care to stay; but it was natural  enough, and I was foolish to grieve. Besides, they come to see me.\"    \"And then they play to you?\" asked the little girl, gently.    \"They say the piano is out of tune,\" the old dame said. \"I don't know.  Perhaps you can tell.\"    The little girl sat down to the piano, and struck a few chords.    \"Yes,\" she said; \"it is badly out of tune. Give me the tuning-hammer. I  am sorry,\" she added, smiling at Oswald Everard, \"but I cannot neglect  my duty. Don't wait for me.\"    \"I will wait for you,\" he said, sullenly; and he went into the balcony  and smoked his pipe, and tried to possess his soul in patience.    When she had faithfully done her work she played a few simple melodies,  such as she knew the old woman would love and understand; and she turned  away when she saw that the listener's eyes were moist.    \"Play once again,\" the old woman whispered. \"I am dreaming of beautiful  things.\"    So the little tuner touched the keys again with all the tenderness of an  angel.    \"Tell your daughters,\" she said, as she rose to say good-bye, \"that the  piano is now in good tune. Then they will play to you the next time they  come.\"    \"I shall always remember you, mademoiselle,\" the old woman said; and,  almost unconsciously, she took the childish face and kissed it.    Oswald Everard was waiting in the hay-field for his companion; and when  she apologised to him for this little professional intermezzo, as she  called it, he recovered from his sulkiness and readjusted his nerves,  which the noise of the tuning had somewhat disturbed.    \"It was very good of you to tune the old dame's piano,\" he said, looking  at her with renewed interest.    \"Some one had to do it, of course,\" she answered, brightly, \"and I am  glad the chance fell to me. What a comfort it is to think that the next  time those daughters come to see her they will play to her and make her  very happy! Poor old dear!\"    \"You puzzle me greatly,\" he said. \"I cannot for the life of me think  what made you choose your calling. You must have many gifts; any one who  talks with you must see that at once. And you play quite nicely, too.\"    \"I am sorry that my profession sticks in your throat,\" she answered.  \"Do be thankful that I am nothing worse than a tuner. For I might be  something worse--a snob, for instance.\"    And, so speaking, she dashed after a butterfly, and left him to recover  from her words. He was conscious of having deserved a reproof; and  when at last he overtook her he said as much, and asked for her kind  indulgence.    \"I forgive you,\" she said, laughing. \"You and I are not looking at  things from the same point of view; but we have had a splendid morning  together, and I have enjoyed every minute of it. And to-morrow I go on  my way.\"    \"And to-morrow you go,\" he repeated. \"Can it not be the day after  to-morrow?\"    \"I am a bird of passage,\" she said, shaking her head. \"You must not seek  to detain me. I have taken my rest, and off I go to other climes.\"      They had arrived at the hotel, and Oswald Everard saw no more of his  companion until the evening, when she came down rather late for _table  d'hote_. She hurried over her dinner and went into the salon. She closed  the door, and sat down to the piano, and lingered there without touching  the keys; once or twice she raised her hands, and then she let them rest  on the notes, and, half unconsciously, they began to move and make sweet  music; and then they drifted into Schumann's \"Abendlied,\" and then the  little girl played some of his \"Kinderscenen,\" and some of his \"Fantasie  Stucke,\" and some of his songs.    Her touch and feeling were exquisite, and her phrasing betrayed the true  musician. The strains of music reached the dining-room, and, one by one,  the guests came creeping in, moved by the music and anxious to see the  musician.    The little girl did not look up; she was in a Schumann mood that  evening, and only the players of Schumann know what enthralling  possession he takes of their very spirit. All the passion and pathos and  wildness and longing had found an inspired interpreter; and those who  listened to her were held by the magic which was her own secret,  and which had won for her such honour as comes only to the few. She  understood Schumann's music, and was at her best with him.    Had she, perhaps, chosen to play his music this evening because she  wished to be at her best? Or was she merely being impelled by an  overwhelming force within her? Perhaps it was something of both.    Was she wishing to humiliate these people who had received her so  coldly? This little girl was only human; perhaps there was something of  that feeling too. Who can tell? But she played as she had never played  in London, or Paris, or Berlin, or New York, or Philadelphia.    At last she arrived at the \"Carnaval,\" and those who heard her declared  afterward that they had never listened to a more magnificent rendering.  The tenderness was so restrained; the vigour was so refined. When  the last notes of that spirited \"Marche des Davidsbundler contre les  Philistins\" had died away, she glanced at Oswald Everard, who was  standing near her almost dazed.    \"And now my favourite piece of all,\" she said; and she at once began  the \"Second Novelette,\" the finest of the eight, but seldom played in  public.    What can one say of the wild rush of the leading theme, and the pathetic  longing of the intermezzo?         . . . The murmuring dying notes,       That fall as soft as snow on the sea;    and         The passionate strain that, deeply going,       Refines the bosom it trembles through.    What can one say of those vague aspirations and finest thoughts which  possess the very dullest among us when such music as that which the  little girl had chosen catches us and keeps us, if only for a passing  moment, but that moment of the rarest worth and loveliness in our  unlovely lives?    What can one say of the highest music except that, like death, it is the  great leveller: it gathers us all to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20715"],[0,"Marriage and Love (#3)"],[1,"of our social fabric. It weeps and moans and suffers with  those who have need of it, yet lack the capacity to rise to love's  summit.    Some day, some day men and women will rise, they will reach the mountain  peak, they will meet big and strong and free, ready to receive, to  partake, and to bask in the golden rays of love. What fancy, what  imagination, what poetic genius can foresee even approximately the  potentialities of such a force in the life of men and women. If the  world is ever to give birth to true companionship and oneness, not  marriage, but love will be the parent.
