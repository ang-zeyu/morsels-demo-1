The time was now come when such men as Robespierre were to be tried with  fire, when they were to drink the cup of fury and the dregs of the cup  of trembling. Sybils and prophets have already spoken their inexorable  decree, as Goethe has said, on the day that first gives the man to the  world; no time and no might can break the stamped mould of his  character; only as life wears on, do all its aforeshapen lines come into  light. He is launched into a sea of external conditions, that are as  independent of his own will as the temperament with which he confronts  them. It is action that tries, and variation of circumstance. The leaden  chains of use bind many an ugly unsuspected prisoner in the soul; and  when the habit of their lives has been sundered, the most immaculate are  capable of antics beyond prevision. A great crisis of the world was  prepared for Robespierre and those others, his allies or his destroyers,  who with him came like the lightning and went like the wind.    At the end of 1788 the King of France found himself forced to summon the  States-General. It was their first assembly since 1614. On the memorable  Fourth of May, 1789, Robespierre appeared at Versailles as one of the  representatives of the third estate of his native province of Artois.  The excitement and enthusiasm of the elections to this renowned  assembly, the immense demands and boundless expectations that they  disclosed, would have warned a cool observer of events, if in that  heated air a cool observer could have been found, that the hour had  struck for the fulfilment of those grim apprehensions of revolution that  had risen in the minds of many shrewd men, good and bad, in the course  of the previous half century. No great event in history ever comes  wholly unforeseen. The antecedent causes are so wide-reaching, many, and  continuous, that their direction is always sure to strike the eye of one  or more observers in all its significance. Lewis the Fifteenth, whose  invincible weariness and heavy disgust veiled a penetrating discernment,  measured accurately the scope of the conflict between the crown and the  parlements: but, said he, things as they are will last my time. Under  the roof of his own palace at Versailles, in the apartment of Madame de  Pompadour's famous physician, one of Quesnai's economic disciples had  cried out, 'The realm is in a sore way; it will never be cured without a  great internal commotion; but woe to those who have to do with it; into  such work the French go with no slack hand.' Rousseau, in a passage in  the Confessions, not only divines a speedy convulsion, but with striking  practical sagacity enumerates the political and social causes that were  unavoidably drawing France to the edge of the abyss. Lord Chesterfield,  so different a man from Rousseau, declared as early as 1752, that he saw  in France every symptom that history had taught him to regard as the  forerunner of deep change; before the end of the century, so his  prediction ran, both the trade of king and the trade of priest in France  would be shorn of half their glory. D'Argenson in the same year declared  a revolution inevitable, and with a curious precision of anticipation  assured himself that if once the necessity arose of convoking the  States-General, they would not assemble in vain: _qu'on y prenne, garde!  ils seraient fort serieux!_ Oliver Goldsmith, idly wandering through  France, towards 1755, discerned in the mutinous attitude of the judicial  corporations, that the genius of freedom was entering the kingdom in  disguise, and that a succession of three weak monarchs would end in the  emancipation of the people of France. The most touching of all these  presentiments is to be found in a private letter of the great Empress,  the mother of Marie Antoinette herself. Maria Theresa describes the  ruined state of the French monarchy, and only prays that if it be doomed  to ruin still more utter, at least the blame may not fall upon her  daughter. The Empress had not learnt that when the giants of social  force are advancing from the sombre shadow of the past, with the thunder  and the hurricane in their hands, our poor prayers are of no more avail  than the unbodied visions of a dream.    The old popular assembly of the realm was not resorted to before every  means of dispensing with so drastic a remedy had been tried. Historians  sometimes write as if Turgot were the only able and reforming minister  of the century. God forbid that we should put any other minister on a  level with that high and beneficent figure. But Turgot was not the first  statesman, both able and patriotic, who had been disgraced for want of  compliance with the conditions of success at court; he was only the last  of a series. Chauvelin, a man of vigour and capacity, was dismissed  with ignominy in 1736. Machault, a reformer, at once courageous and  wise, shared the same fate twenty years later; and in his case  revolution was as cruel and as heedless as reaction, for, at the age of  ninety-one, the old man was dragged, blind and deaf, before the  revolutionary tribunal and thence despatched to the guillotine. Between  Chauvelin and Machault, the elder D'Argenson, who was greater than  either of them, had been raised to power, and then speedily hurled down  from it (1747), for no better reason than that his manners were uncouth,  and that he would not waste his time in frivolities that were as the  breath of life in the great gallery at Versailles and on the  smooth-shaven lawns of Fontainebleau.    Not only had wise counsellors been tried; consultative assemblies had  been tried also. Necker had been dismissed in 1781, after publishing the  memorable Report which first initiated the nation in the elements of  financial knowledge. The disorder waxed greater, and the monarchy drew  nearer to bankruptcy each year. The only modern parallel to the state of  things in France under Lewis the Sixteenth is to be sought in the state  of things in Egypt or in Turkey. Lewis the Fourteenth had left a debt of  between two and three thousand millions of livres, but this had been  wiped out by the heroic operations of Law; operations, by the way, which  have never yet been scientifically criticised. But the debt soon grew  again, by foolish wars, by the prodigality of the court, and by the  rapacity of the nobles. It amounted in 1789 to something like two  hundred and forty millions sterling; and it is interesting to notice  that this was exactly the sum of the public debt of Great Britain at the  same time. The year's excess of expenditure over receipts in 1774 was  about fifty millions of livres: in 1787 it was one hundred and forty  millions, or according to a different computation even two hundred  millions. The material case was not at all desperate, if only the court  had been less infatuated, and the spirit of the privileged orders had  been less blind and less vile. The fatality of the situation lay in the  characters of a handful of men and women. For France was abundant in  resources, and even at this moment was far from unprosperous, in spite  of the incredible trammels of law and custom. An able financier, with  the support of a popular chamber and the assent of the sovereign, could  have had no difficulty in restoring the public credit. But the  conditions, simple as they might seem to a patriot or to posterity, were  unattainable so long as power remained with a caste that were anything  we please except patriots. An Assembly of Notables was brought together,  but it was only the empty phantasm of national representation. Yet the  situation was so serious that even this body, of arbitrary origin as it  was, still was willing to accept vital reforms. The privileged order,  who were then as their descendants are now, the worst conservative party  in Europe, immediately persuaded the magisterial corporation to resist  the Notables. The judicial corporation or Parlement of Paris had been  suppressed under Lewis the Fifteenth, and unfortunately revived again at  the accession of his grandson. By the inconvenient constitution of the  French government, the assent of that body was indispensable to fiscal  legislation, on the ground that such legislation was part of the general  police of the realm. The king's minister, now Lomenie de Brienne,  devised a new judicial constitution. But the churchmen, the nobles, and  the lawyers all united in protestations against such a blow. The common  people are not always the best judges of a remedy for the evils under  which they are the greatest sufferers, and they broke out in disorder  both in Paris and the provinces. They discerned an attack upon their  local independence. Nobody would accept office in the new courts, and  the administration of justice was at a standstill. A loan was thrown  upon the market, but the public could not be persuaded to take it up. It  was impossible to collect the taxes. The interest on the national debt  was unpaid, and the fundholder was dismayed and exasperated by an  announcement that only two-fifths would be discharged in cash. A very  large part of the national debt was held in the form of annuities for  lives, and men who had invested their savings on the credit of the  government, saw themselves left without a provision. The total number of  fundholders cannot be ascertained with any precision, but it must have  been very considerable, especially in Paris and the other great cities.  Add to these all the civil litigants in the kingdom, who had portions of  their property virtually sequestrated by the suspension of the courts  into which the property had been taken. The resentment of this immense  body of defrauded public creditors and injured private suitors explains  the alienation of the middle class"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20748"],[0,"Favorite Fairy Tales (#3)"],[1," with the young ones; for they were afraid  of the water, and I could not get them there. I called and scolded, but  it was all of no use. But let me see the egg--ah, yes! to be sure, that  is a turkey's egg. Leave it, and teach the other little ones to swim.\"    [Illustration: _The Ugly Duckling_  \"What is the Matter?\" asked the Old Woman]    \"I will sit on it a little longer,\" said the Duck. \"I have been sitting  so long, that I may as well spend the harvest here.\"    \"It is no business of mine,\" said the old Duck, and away she waddled.    The great egg burst at last. \"Chick! chick!\" said the little one, and  out it tumbled--but, oh! how large and ugly it was! The Duck looked at  it. \"That is a great, strong creature,\" said she. \"None of the others  are at all like it. Can it be a young turkey-cock? Well, we shall soon  find out. It must go into the water, though I push it in myself.\"    The next day there was delightful weather, and the sun shone warmly upon  the green leaves when Mother Duck with all her family went down to the  canal. Plump she went into the water. \"Quack! quack!\" cried she, and one  duckling after another jumped in. The water closed over their heads, but  all came up again, and swam together quite easily. Their legs moved  without effort. All were there, even the ugly grey one.    \"No; it is not a turkey,\" said the old Duck; \"only see how prettily it  moves its legs, how upright it holds itself! It is my own child. It is  also really very pretty, when you look more closely at it. Quack! quack!  now come with me, I will take you into the world and introduce you in  the duck-yards. But keep close to me, or someone may tread on you; and  beware of the Cat.\"    So they came into the duck-yard. There was a horrid noise; two families  were quarreling about the head of an eel, which in the end was carried  off by the Cat.    \"See, my children, such is the way of the world,\" said the Mother Duck,  wiping her beak, for she, too, was fond of eels. \"Now use your legs,\"  said she, \"keep together, and bow to the old Duck you see yonder. She  is the most distinguished of all the fowls present, and is of Spanish  blood, which accounts for her dignified appearance and manners. And  look, she has a red rag on her leg! That is considered extremely  handsome, and is the greatest honor a Duck can have. Don't turn your  feet inwards; a well-educated Duckling always keeps his legs far apart,  like his father and mother, just so--look! Now bow your necks, and say,  'Quack.'\"    And they did as they were told. But the other Ducks, who were in the  yard, looked at them and said aloud, \"Just see! Now we have another  brood, as if there were not enough of us already. And fie! how ugly  that one is. We will not endure it.\" And immediately one of the Ducks  flew at him, and bit him in the neck.    [Illustration]    \"Leave him alone,\" said the mother. \"He is doing no one any harm.\"    \"Yes, but he is so large and so strange-looking, and therefore he shall  be teased,\" said the others.    \"Those are fine children that our good mother has,\" said the old Duck  with the red rag on her leg. \"All are pretty except one, and that has  not turned out well; I almost wish it could be hatched over again.\"    \"That cannot be, please your Highness,\" said the mother. \"Certainly he  is not handsome, but he is a very good child, and swims as well as the  others, indeed, rather better. I think he will grow like the others all  in good time, and perhaps will look smaller. He stayed so long in the  egg-shell, that is the cause of the difference.\" And she scratched the  Duckling's neck, and stroked his whole body. \"Besides,\" added she, \"he  is a Drake. I think he will be very strong, so it does not matter so  much. He will fight his way through.\"    [Illustration]    \"The other Ducks are very pretty,\" said the old Duck. \"Pray make  yourselves at home, and if you find an eel's head you can bring it  to me.\"    So they made themselves at home.    But the poor little Duckling, who had come last out of its egg-shell,  and who was so ugly, was bitten, pecked, and teased by both Ducks and  Hens. \"It is so large!\" said they all. And the Turkey-cock, who had come  into the world with spurs on, and therefore fancied he was an emperor,  puffed himself up like a ship in full sail, and marched up to the  Duckling quite red with passion. The poor little thing scarcely knew  what to do. He was quite distressed, because he was so ugly, and  because he was the jest of the poultry-yard.    So passed the first day, and afterwards matters grew worse and  worse--the poor Duckling was scorned by all. Even his brothers and  sisters behaved unkindly, and were constantly saying, \"May the Cat take  you, you nasty creature!\" The mother said, \"Ah, if you were only far  away!\" The Ducks bit him, the Hens pecked him, and the girl who fed the  poultry kicked him.    He ran through the hedge, and the little birds in the bushes were  terrified. \"That is because I am so ugly,\" thought the Duckling,  shutting his eyes, but he ran on. At last he came to a wide moor,  where lived some Wild Ducks; here he lay the whole night, very tired  and comfortless. In the morning the Wild Ducks flew up, and saw their  new companion. \"Pray who are you?\" asked they; and our little Duckling  turned himself in all directions, and greeted them as politely as  possible.    \"You are really uncommonly ugly!\" said the Wild Ducks. \"However, that  does not matter to us, provided you do not marry into our families.\"  Poor thing! he had never thought of marrying; he only begged permission  to lie among the reeds, and drink the water of the moor.    [Illustration]    There he lay for two whole days. On the third day there came two Wild  Geese, or rather Ganders, who had not been long out of their egg-shells,  which accounts for their impertinence.    \"Hark ye,\" said they; \"you are so ugly that we like you very well. Will  you come with us and be a bird of passage? On another moor, not far  from this, are some dear, sweet Wild Geese, as lovely creatures as have  ever said 'Hiss, hiss.' You are truly in the way to make your fortune,  ugly as you are.\"    Bang! a gun went off all at once, and both Wild Geese were stretched  dead among the reeds; the water became red with blood. Bang! a gun went  off again. Whole flocks of Wild Geese flew up from among the reeds, and  another report followed.    There was a grand hunting party. The hunters lay in ambush all around;  some were even sitting in the trees, whose huge branches stretched far  over the moor. The blue smoke rose through the thick trees like a mist,  and was dispersed as it fell over the water. The hounds splashed about  in the mud, the reeds and rushes bent in all directions.    How frightened the poor little Duck was! He turned his head, thinking  to hide it under his wings, and in a moment a most formidable-looking  Dog stood close to him, his tongue hanging out of his mouth, his eyes  sparkling fearfully. He opened wide his jaws at the sight of our  Duckling, showing him his sharp white teeth, and, splash, splash!  he was gone--gone without hurting him.    \"Well! let me be thankful,\" sighed he. \"I am so ugly that even the Dog  will not eat me.\"    And now he lay still, though the shooting continued among the reeds,  shot following shot.    The noise did not cease till late in the day, and even then the poor  little thing dared not stir. He waited several hours before he looked  around him, and then hurried away from the moor as fast as he could.  He ran over fields and meadows, though the wind was so high that he  had some difficulty in moving.    Towards evening he reached a wretched little hut, so wretched that it  knew not on which side to fall, and therefore remained standing. The  wind blew violently, so that our poor little Duckling was obliged to  support himself on his tail, in order to stand against it; but it  became worse and worse. He then noticed that the door had lost one  of its hinges, and hung so much awry that he could creep through the  crack into the room. So he went in.    In this room lived an old woman, with her Tom-cat and her Hen. The Cat,  whom she called her little son, knew how to set up his back and purr;  indeed, he could even throw out sparks when stroked the wrong way. The  Hen had very short legs, and was therefore called \"Chickie Short-legs.\"  She laid very good eggs, and the old woman loved her as her own child.    The next morning the new guest was discovered, and the Cat began to mew  and the Hen to cackle.    [Illustration]    \"What is the matter?\" asked the old woman, looking round. But her eyes  were not good, so she took the young Duckling to be a fat Duck who had  lost her way. \"This is a capital catch,\" said she, \"I shall now have  Duck's eggs, if it be not a Drake. We shall see.\"    And so the Duckling was kept on trial for three weeks, but no eggs made  their appearance. Now the Cat was the master of the house, and the Hen  was the mistress, and always used to say, \"We and the world,\" for they  imagined themselves to be not only the half of the world, but also by  far the better half. The Duckling thought it was possible to be of a  different opinion, but that the Hen would not allow.    \"Can you lay eggs?\" asked she.    \"No.\"    \"Well, then, hold your tongue.\"    And the Cat said, \"Can you set up your back? Can you purr?\"    \"No.\"    \"Well, then, you should have no opinion when reasonable people are  speaking.\"    So the Duckling sat alone in a corner, and felt very miserable. However,  he happened to think of the fresh air and bright sunshine, and these  thoughts gave him such a strong desire to swim again, that he could not  help telling it to the Hen.    \"What ails you?\" said the Hen. \"You have nothing to do, and therefore  brood over these fancies. Either lay eggs or purr, then you will forget  them.\"    \"But it is so delicious to swim!\" said the Duckling. \"So delicious when  the waters"]]]
