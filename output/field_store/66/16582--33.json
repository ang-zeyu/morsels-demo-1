It is nor improbable, that such an offer might have been made,  and been hearkened to; but it is nowise probable, that all the interest  of the court would ever with this house of commons, have been able  to make it effectual. Clarendon showed his prudence, no less than his  integrity, in entirely rejecting it.    The chancellor, from the same principles of conduct, hastened to disband  the army. When the king reviewed these veteran troops, he was struck  with their beauty, order, discipline, and martial appearance; and being  sensible, that regular forces are most necessary implements of royalty,  he expressed a desire of finding expedients still to retain them.    But his wise minister set before him the dangerous spirit by which  these troops were actuated, their enthusiastic genius, their habits of  rebellion and mutiny; and he convinced the king, that, till they were  disbanded, he never could esteem himself securely established on his  throne. No more troops were retained than a few guards and garrisons,  about one thousand horse and four thousand foot. This was the first  appearance, under the monarchy, of a regular standing army in this  island. Lord Mordaunt said, that the king, being possessed of that  force, might now look upon himself as the most considerable gentleman in  England.[*] The fortifications of Gloucester, Taunton, and other towns,  which had made resistance to the king during the civil wars, were  demolished.         * King James's Memoirs. This prince says, that Vernier's       insurrection furnished a reason or pretence for keeping up       the guards, which were intended at first to have been       disbanded with the rest of the army.    Clarendon not only behaved with wisdom and justice in the office of  chancellor; all the counsels which he gave the king tended equally to  promote the interest of prince and people. Charles, accustomed in his  exile to pay entire deference to the judgment of this faithful servant,  continued still to submit to his direction; and for some time no  minister was ever possessed of more absolute authority. He moderated the  forward zeal of the royalists, and tempered their appetite for revenge.  With the opposite party, he endeavored to preserve inviolate all the  king's engagements: he kept an exact register of the promises which had  been made for any service, he employed all his industry to fulfil  them. This good minister was now nearly allied to the royal family.  His daughter, Ann Hyde, a woman of spirit and fine accomplishments, had  hearkened, while abroad, to the addresses of the duke of York, and under  promise of marriage, had secretly admitted him to her bed. Her pregnancy  appeared soon after the restoration; and though many endeavored to  dissuade the king from consenting to so unequal an alliance, Charles,  in pity to his friend and minister, who had been ignorant of these  engagements, permitted his brother to marry her.[*] Clarendon expressed  great uneasiness at the honor which he had obtained; and said that, by  being elevated so much above his rank, he thence dreaded a more sudden  downfall.         * King James's Memoirs.    Most circumstances of Clarendon's administration have met with applause:  his maxims alone in the conduct of ecclesiastical politics have by  many been deemed the effect of prejudices narrow and bigoted. Had the  jealousy of royal power prevailed so far with the convention parliament  as to make them restore the king with strict limitations, there is no  question but the establishment of Presbyterian discipline had been  one of the conditions most rigidly insisted on. Not only that form of  ecclesiastical government is more favorable to liberty than to royal  power; it was likewise, on its own account, agreeable to the majority of  the house of commons, and suited their religious principles. But as  the impatience of the people, the danger of delay, the general disgust  towards faction, and the authority of Monk, had prevailed over that  jealous project of limitations, the full settlement of the hierarchy,  together with the monarchy, was a necessary and infallible consequence.  All the royalists were zealous for that mode of religion; the merits of  the Episcopal clergy towards the king, as well as their sufferings on  that account, had been great; the laws which established bishops and the  liturgy, were as yet unrepealed by legal authority; and any attempt of  the parliament, by new acts, to give the superiority to Presbyterianism,  had been sufficient to involve the nation again in blood and confusion.  Moved by these views, the commons had wisely postponed the examination  of all religious controversy, and had left the settlement of the church  to the king and to the ancient laws.    The king at first used great moderation in the execution of the laws.  Nine bishops still remained alive; and these were immediately restored  to their sees: all the ejected clergy recovered their livings: the  liturgy, a form of worship decent, and not without beauty, was again  admitted into the churches: but at the same time a declaration was  issued, in order to give contentment to the Presbyterians, and preserve  an air of moderation and neutrality.[*] In this declaration, the  king promised, that he would provide suffragan bishops for the larger  dioceses; that the prelates should, all of them, be regular and constant  preachers; that they should not confer ordination, or exercise any  jurisdiction, without the advice and assistance of presbyters chosen  by the diocese; that such alterations should be made in the liturgy as  would render it totally unexceptionable; that, in the mean time, the use  of that mode of worship should not be imposed on such as were unwilling  to receive it; and that the surplice, the cross in baptism, and  bowing at the name of Jesus, should not be rigidly insisted on. This  declaration was issued by the king as head of the church; and he plainly  assumed, in many parts of it, a legislative authority in ecclesiastical  matters. But the English government, though more exactly defined by  late contests, was not as yet reduced in every particular to the strict  limits of law. And if ever pre-rogative was justifiably employed, it  seemed to be on the present occasion; when all parts of the state were  torn with past convulsions, and required the moderating hand of the  chief magistrate to reduce them to their ancient order.         * Parl. Hist vol. xxiii. p. 173    But though these appearances of neutrality were maintained, and a  mitigated Episcopacy only seemed to be insisted on, it was far from  the intention of the ministry always to preserve like regard to the  Presbyterians. The madness of the Fifth Monarchy men afforded them a  pretence for departing from it. Venner, a desperate enthusiast, who  had often conspired against Cromwell, having, by his zealous lectures  inflamed his own imagination and that of his followers, issued forth  at their head into the streets of London. They were, to the number  of sixty, completely armed, believed themselves invulnerable and  invincible, and firmly expected the same success which had attended  Gideon and other heroes of the Old Testament Every one at first fled  before them. One unhappy man, who, being questioned, said, \"he was  for God and King Charles,\" was instantly murdered by them. They went  triumphantly from street to street, every where proclaiming King Jesus,  who, they said, was their invisible leader. At length, the magistrates,  having assembled some train bands, made an attack upon them. They  defended themselves with order as well as valor; and after killing  many of the assailants they made a regular retreat into Cane Wood, near  Hampstead. Next morning, they were chased thence by a detachment of  the guards; but they ventured again to invade the city, which was  not prepared to receive them. After committing great disorder, and  traversing almost every street of that immense capital, they retired  into a house, which they were resolute to defend to the last extremity.  Being surrounded, and the house untiled, they were fired upon from every  side; and they still refused quarter. The people rushed in upon them,  and seized the few who were alive. These were tried, condemned, and  executed; and to the last they persisted in affirming, that, if they  were deceived, it was the Lord that had deceived them.    Clarendon and the ministry took occasion, from this insurrection,  to infer the dangerous spirit of the Presbyterians, and of all the  sectaries: but the madness of the attempt sufficiently proved, that  it had been undertaken by no concert, and never could have proved  dangerous. The well-known hatred, too, which prevailed between the  Presbyterians and the other sects, should have removed the former from  all suspicion of any concurrence in the enterprise. But as a pretence  was wanted, besides their old demerits, for justifying the intended  rigors against all of them, this reason, however slight, was greedily  laid hold of.    Affairs in Scotland hastened with still quicker steps then those in  England towards a settlement and a compliance with the king. It was  deliberated in the English council, whether that nation should be  restored to its liberty, or whether the forts erected by Cromwell should  not still be upheld, in order to curb the mutinous spirit by which the  Scots in all ages had been so much governed. Lauderdale, who, from the  battle of Worcester to the restoration, had been detained prisoner in  the Tower, had considerable influence with the king; and he strenuously  opposed"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19217"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol.II. (#3)"],[1,"in favour of the late  king, even while Argyle and Monmouth were in open rebellion. A spirit of  discontent had by this time diffused itself through the army, and become  so formidable to the court, that the king resolved to retain the Dutch  troops in England and send over to Holland in their room such regiments  as were most tinctured with disaffection. Of these the Scottish regiment  of Dumbarton, commanded by mareschal Schomberg, mutinied on its march  to Ipswich, seized the military chest, disarmed the officers who opposed  their design, declared for king James, and with four pieces of cannon  began their march for Scotland. William, being informed of this revolt,  ordered general Ginckel to pursue them with three regiments of  Dutch dragoons, and the mutineers surrendered at discretion. As the  delinquents were natives of Scotland, which had not yet submitted in  form to the new government, the king did not think proper to punish  them as rebels, but ordered them to proceed for Holland according to his  first intention. Though this attempt proved abortive, it made a strong  impression upon the ministry, who were divided among themselves and  wavered in their principles. However, they used this opportunity to  bring in a bill for punishing mutiny and desertion, which in a little  time passed both houses and received the royal assent.          CORONATION--ABOLITION OF HEARTH-MONEY.    The coronation oath [003] _[See note C, at the end of this Vol.]_ being  altered and explained, that ceremony was performed on the eleventh day  of April, the bishop of London officiating, at the king's desire, in the  room of the metropolitan, who was a malcontent; and next day the commons  in a body waited on the king and queen at Whitehall, with an address of  congratulation. William, with a view to conciliate the affections of his  new subjects, and check the progress of clamour and discontent,  signified in a solemn message to the house of commons, his readiness to  acquiesce in any measure they should think proper to take for a new  regulation or total suppression of the hearth-money, which he understood  was a grievous imposition on his subjects; and this tax was afterwards  abolished. He was gratified with an address of thanks, couched in the  warmest expressions of duty, gratitude, and affection, declaring they  would take such measures in support of his crown, as would convince the  world that he reigned in the hearts of his people.          THE COMMONS VOTE MONEY TO INDEMNIFY THE DUTCH.    He had, in his answer to their former address, assured them of his  constant regard to the rights and prosperity of the nation: he had  explained the exhausted state of the Dutch; expatiated upon the zeal of  that republic for the interests of Britain, as well as the maintenance  of the protestant religion; and expressed his hope that the English  parliament would not only repay the sums they had expended in his  expedition, but likewise further support them to the utmost of their  ability against the common enemies of their liberties and religion. He  had observed that a considerable army and fleet would be necessary for  the reduction of Ireland and the protection of Britain, and he desired  they would settle the revenue in such a manner that it might be  collected without difficulty and dispute. The sum total of the money  expended by the states-general in William's expedition amounted to  seven millions of guilders, and the commons granted six hundred thousand  pounds for the discharge of this debt, incurred for the preservation of  their rights and religion. They voted funds for raising and maintaining  an army of two-and-twenty thousand men, as well as for equipping  a numerous fleet: but they provided for no more than half a year's  subsistence of the troops, hoping the reduction of Ireland might  be finished in that term; and this instance of frugality the king  considered as a mark of their diffidence of his administration. The  whigs were resolved to supply him gradually, that he might be the more  dependent upon their zeal and attachment; but he was not at all pleased  with their precaution.          WILLIAM'S EFFORTS IN FAVOUR OF DISSENTEES.    William was naturally biassed to Calvinism, and averse to persecution.  Whatever promises he had made, and whatever sentiments of respect he had  entertained for the church of England, he seemed now in a great measure  alienated from it by the opposition he had met with from its members,  particularly from the bishops who had thwarted his measures. By  absenting themselves from parliament, and refusing the oath, they had  plainly disowned his title and renounced his government. He therefore  resolved to mortify the church, and gratify his own friends at the  same time, by removing the obstacles affixed to nonconformity, that  all protestant dissenters should be rendered capable of enjoying and  exercising civil employments. When he gave his assent to the bill for  suspending the _habeas-corpus_ act, he recommended the establishment of  a new oath in lieu of those of allegiance and supremacy: he expressed  his hope that they would leave room for the admission of all his  protestant subjects who should be found qualified for the service;  he said, such a conjunction would unite them the more firmly among  themselves, and strengthen them against their common adversaries.  In consequence of this hint, a clause was inserted in the bill  for abrogating the old and appointing the new oaths, by which the  sacramental test was declared unnecessary in rendering any person  capable of enjoying any office or employment. It was, however, rejected  by a great majority in the house of lords. Another clause for the  same purpose, though in different terms, was proposed by the king's  direction, and met with the same fate, though in both cases several  noblemen entered a protest against the resolution of the house. These  fruitless efforts in favour of dissenters augmented the prejudice of the  churchmen against king William, who would have willingly compromised  the difference by excusing the clergy from the oaths, provided the  dissenters might be exempted from the sacramental test: but this was  deemed the chief bulwark of the church, and therefore the proposal was  rejected. The church party in the house of lords moved, That instead  of inserting a clause obliging the clergy to take the oaths, the king  should be empowered to tender them; and, in case of their refusal, they  should incur the penalty, because deprivation, or the apprehensions of  it, might make them desperate and excite them to form designs against  the government. This argument had no weight with the commons, who  thought it was indispensably necessary to exact the oaths of the clergy,  as their example influenced the kingdom in general, and the youth of  the nation were formed under their instructions. After a long and  warm debate, all the mitigation that could be obtained was a clause  empowering the king to indulge any twelve clergymen, deprived by virtue  of this act, with a third part of their benefices during pleasure.  Thus the ancient oaths of allegiance and supremacy were abrogated: the  declaration of non-resistance in the act of uniformity was repealed: the  new oath of allegiance was reduced to its primitive simplicity, and the  coronation-oath rendered more explicit. The clergy were enjoined to take  the new oaths before the first day of August, on pain of being suspended  from their office for six months, and of entire deprivation, in case  they should not take them before the expiration of this term. They  generally complied, though with such reservations and distinctions as  were not much for the honour of their sincerity.          ACT FOR A TOLERATION.    The king, though baffled in his design against the sacramental test,  resolved to indulge the dissenters with a toleration; and a bill for  this purpose being prepared by the earl of Nottingham, was, after some  debate, passed into a law, under the title of an act for exempting their  majesties' protestant subjects, dissenting from the church of England,  from the penalties of certain laws. It enacted, That none of the penal  laws should be construed to extend to those dissenters who should take  the oaths to the present government, and subscribe the declaration of  the thirtieth year of the reign of Charles II. provided that they should  hold no private assemblies or conventicles with the doors shut; that  nothing should be construed to exempt them from the payment of tithes or  other parochial duties: that, in case of being chosen into the office  of constable, churchwarden, overseer, &c. and of scrupling to take the  oaths annexed to such offices, they should be allowed to execute the  employment by deputy: that the preachers and teachers in congregations  of dissenting protestants who should take the oaths, subscribe the  declaration, together with all the articles of religion, except  the thirty-fourth and the two succeeding articles, and part of the  twentieth, should be exempted from the penalties decreed against  non-conformists, as well as from serving upon juries, or acting in  parish offices: yet all justices of the peace were empowered to require  such dissenters to subscribe the declaration and take the oaths; and, in  case of refusal, to commit them to prison without bail or mainprize.  The same indulgence was extended to anabaptists, and even to quakers,  on their solemn promise before God to be faithful to the king and queen,  and their assenting by profession and asseveration to those articles  which the others ratified upon oath: they were likewise required to  profess their belief in the Trinity and the Holy Scriptures. Even the  papists felt the benign influence of William's moderation in spiritual  matters: he rejected the proposal of some zealots, who exhorted him to  enact severe laws against popish recusants. Such a measure,"]]]
