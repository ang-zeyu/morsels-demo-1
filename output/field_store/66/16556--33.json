And behind these soldiers they discovered  a nation. Do they realize now what a force they have awakened? Do they  understand that a steadfast, indomitable resolution, despising all  theatrical display, is moving Russia's hosts? Even if the Russian  Generals had proved mediocre, even if many disappointing days had been  in store, the nation would not belie its history. It has seen more than  one conquering army go down before it--the Tartars and the Poles, the  Swedes of Charles XII., the Prussians of Frederick the Great, the Grand  Army of Napoleon were not less formidable than the Kaiser's army, but  the task of mastering a united Russia proved too much for each one of  them. The Germans counted on the fratricidal feud between Poles and  Russians, on the resentment of the Jews, on the Mohammedan sympathies  with Turkey, and so forth. They had to learn too late that the Jews had  rallied around the country of their hearths, and that the best of them  cannot believe that Russia will continue to deny them the measure of  justice and humanity which the leaders of Russian thought have long  acknowledged to be due to them. More important still, the Germans have  read the Grand Duke's appeal to the Poles and must have heard of the  manner in which it was received in Poland, of the enthusiastic support  offered to the Russian cause. If nothing else came of this great  historical upheaval but the reconciliation of the Russians and their  noble kinsmen the Poles, the sacrifices which this crisis demands would  not be too great a price to pay for the result.    But the hour of trial has revealed other things. It has appealed to the  best feelings and the best elements of the Russian Nation. It has  brought out in a striking manner the fundamental tendency of Russian  political life and the essence of Russian culture, which so many people  have been unable to perceive on account of the chaff on the surface.  Russia has been going through a painful crisis. In the words of the  Manifesto of Oct. 17, (30,) 1905, the outward casing of her  administration had become too narrow and oppressive for the development  of society with its growing needs, its altered perceptions of rights and  duties, its changed relations between Government and people. The result  was that deep-seated political malaise which made itself felt during the  Japanese war, when society at large refused to take any interest in the  fate of the army; the feverish rush for \"liberties\" after the defeat;  the subsequent reign of reaction and repression, which has cast such a  gloom over Russian life during these last years. But the effort of the  national struggle had dwarfed all these misunderstandings and  misfortunes as in Great Britain the call of the common fatherland has  dwarfed the dispute between Unionists and Home Rulers. Russian parties  have not renounced their aspirations; Russian Liberals in particular  believe in self-government and the rule of law as firmly as ever. But  they have realized as one man that this war is not an adventure  engineered by unscrupulous ambition, but a decisive struggle for  independence and existence; and they are glad to be arrayed in close  ranks with their opponents from the Conservative side. A friend, a  Liberal like myself, writes to me from Moscow: \"It is a great,  unforgettable time; we are happy to be all at one!\" And from the ranks  of the most unfortunate of Russia's children, from the haunts of the  political exiles in Paris, comes the news that Bourtzeff, one of the  most prominent among the revolutionary leaders, has addressed an appeal  to his comrades urging them to stand by their country to the utmost of  their power.    I may add that whatever may have been the shortcomings and the blunders  of the Russian Government, it is a blessing in this decisive crisis that  Russians should have a firmly knit organization and a traditional centre  of authority in the power of the Czar. The present Emperor stands as the  national leader, not in the histrionic attitude of a war lord but in the  quiet dignity of his office. He has said and done the right thing, and  his subjects will follow him to a man. We are sure he will remember in  the hour of victory the unstinted devotion and sacrifices of all the  nationalities and parties of his vast empire. It is our firm conviction  that the sad tale of reaction and oppression is at an end in Russia, and  that our country will issue from this momentous crisis with the insight  and strength required for the constructive and progressive statesmanship  of which it stands in need.    Apart from the details of political and social reform, is the  regeneration of Russia a boon or a peril to European civilization? The  declamations of the Germans have been as misleading in this respect as  in all others. The masterworks of Russian literature are accessible in  translation nowadays, and the cheap taunts of men like Bernhardi recoil  on their own heads. A nation represented by Pushkin, Turgeneff, Tolstoy,  Dostoyevsky in literature, by Kramskoy, Verestchagin, Repin, Glinka,  Moussorgsky, Tchaikovsky in art, by Mendeleiff, Metchnikoff, Pavloff in  science, by Kluchevsky and Solovieff in history, need not be ashamed to  enter the lists in an international competition for the prizes of  culture. But the German historians ought to have taught their pupils  that in the world of ideas it is not such competitions that are  important. A nation handicapped by its geography may have to start later  in the field, and yet her performance may be relatively better than that  of her more favored neighbors. It is astonishing to read German  diatribes about Russian backwardness when one remembers that as recently  as fifty years ago Austria and Prussia were living under a regime which  can hardly be considered more enlightened than the present rule in  Russia. The Italians in Lombardy and Venice have still a vivid  recollection of Austrian jails; and, as for Prussian militarism, one  need not go further than the exploits of the Zabern garrisons to  illustrate its meaning. This being so, it is not particularly to be  wondered at that the eastern neighbor of Austria and Prussia has  followed to some extent on the same lines.    But the general direction of Russia's evolution is not doubtful. Western  students of her history might do well, instead of sedulously collecting  damaging evidence, to pay some attention to the building up of Russia's  universities, the persistent efforts of the Zemstvos, the independence  and the zeal of the press. German scholars should read Hertzen's vivid  description of the \"idealists of the forties.\" And what about the  history of the emancipation of the serfs, or of the regeneration of the  judicature? The \"reforms of the sixties\" are a household word in Russia,  and surely they are one of the noblest efforts ever made by a nation in  the direction of moral improvement.    Looking somewhat deeper, what right have the Germans to speak of their  cultural ideals as superior to those of the Russian people? They deride  the superstitions of the mujikh as if tapers and genuflexions were the  principal matters of popular religion. Those who have studied the  Russian people without prejudice know better than that. Read Selma  Lagerloef's touching description of Russian pilgrims in Palestine. She,  the Protestant, has understood the true significance of the religious  impulse which leads these poor men to the Holy Land, and which draws  them to the numberless churches of the vast country. These simple people  cling to the belief that there is something else in God's world besides  toil and greed; they flock toward the light, and find in it the  justification of their human craving for peace and mercy. For the  Russian people have the Christian virtues of patience in suffering;  their pity for the poor and oppressed are more than occasional  manifestations of individual feeling--they are deeply rooted in national  psychology. This frame of mind has been scorned as fit for slaves! It is  indeed a case where the learning of philosophers is put to shame by the  insight of the simple-minded. Conquerors should remember that the  greatest victories in history have been won by the unarmed--by the  Christian confessors whom the Emperors sent to the lions, by the \"old  believers\" of Russia who went to Siberia and to the flames for their  unyielding faith, by the Russian serfs who preserved their human dignity  and social cohesion in spite of the exactions of their masters, by the  Italians, Poles, and Jews, when they were trampled under foot by their  rulers. It is such a victory of the spirit that Tolstoy had in mind when  he preached his gospel of non-resistance, and I do not think even a  German on the war path would be blind enough to suppose that Tolstoy's  message came from a craven soul. The orientation of the so-called  \"intelligent\" class in Russia--that is, the educated middle class, which  is much more numerous and influential than people suppose--is somewhat  different, of course. It is \"Western\" in this sense, that it is imbued  with current European ideas as to politics, economics, and law.    It has to a certain extent lost the simple faith and religious fervor of  the peasants, but the keynote of popular ideals has been faithfully  preserved by this class. It is still characteristically humanitarian in  its view of the world and in its aims. A book like that of Gen. von  Bernhardi would be impossible in Russia. If anybody were to publish it  it would not only fall flat, but earn for its author the reputation of a  bloodhound. Many deeds of cruelty and brutality happen, of course, in  Russia, but no writer of any standing would dream of building up a  theory of violence in vindication of a claim to culture. It may be said,  in fact, that the leaders of Russian public opinion are"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18884"],[0,"Ducks at a Distance: A Waterfowl Identification Guide (#3)"],[1,"birds and animals add to the enjoyment of being in a blind.    The same sources of food and shelter that draw waterfowl to ponds and  marshes also attract other forms of wildlife.    Protected species are sometimes more numerous than ducks or geese.    Money from Duck Stamp sales is used exclusively to purchase wetlands,  preserving areas for ducks, geese, and all wildlife for the enjoyment  and pleasure of hunters and non-hunters alike.          Administrative Waterfowl Flyways      Waterfowl Flyways    The term \"flyway\" has long been used to designate the migration routes  of birds. For management purposes, four waterfowl flyways--Pacific,  Central, Mississippi, and Atlantic--were established in the United  States in 1948. To varying degrees the waterfowl populations using each  of these flyways differ in abundance, species composition, migration  pathways, and breeding ground origin. There are differences, also, in  levels of shooting pressure and harvest.    For the most part flyway boundaries follow State lines. However, the  boundary between the Pacific and the Central flyway general follows the  Continental Divide.    There are some problems in matching waterfowl migration corridors with  flyway boundaries because some species nest and winter in areas that do  not occur along a north-south axis. These species cross flyway  boundaries during migration. On balance, the present arrangement is  useful in that it permits reasonable management of waterfowl. At some  future time, it is possible that further rearrangement of boundaries may  permit better management of the waterfowl resource.      Flyway Councils    In 1952, Flyway Councils were formed in each of the four flyways. The  Council in each flyway is made up of representatives from the wildlife  agencies of the States in that flyway--one representative from each  State. The Councils study flyway problems, develop waterfowl management  recommendations, and generally work closely with the U.S. Fish and  Wildlife Service in implementing waterfowl management and research  programs.
