A few only will here be  mentioned, who on account of some circumstances connected with the  fabric, or for other reasons, are more noteworthy.        [1] It is noteworthy that they all held some other preferment          during the time that they held the office of dean.    #Thomas de Bembre#, 1350-1361, founded a chantry and an altar in the  north part of the north transept, which was added at this time.    #Reginald Pole#, so well known in the history of the reigns of Henry  VIII. and Queen Mary, was Dean of Wimborne from 1517 till 1537. It is  remarkable that he was only seventeen years of age at the time of his  appointment.    He was succeeded by #Nicholas Wilson#, who held the office of dean until  the dissolution of the deanery in 1547. To him a curious letter still  existing was addressed in 1538 by certain leading men of the parish,  though nothing appears to have been done in consequence of it. These  worthy men complain of the dilapidated state of the church, the want  of funds to carry out needed repairs, and suggest the taking from the  church \"seynt Cuthborow's hed,\" and \"the sylv' y^t ys about the same  hed,\" which they claim as belonging to the parish on the ground that  it was made by the charity of the parishioners in times past. \"Our  chyrche,\" they say, \"ys in gret ruyn and decay and our toure ys  foundered and lyke to fall and ther ys no money left in [~o] chyrche box  and by reason of great infyrmyty and deth ther hath byn thys yere in  oure parysh no chyrche aele, the whych hath hyndred [~o] chyrch of xx^ti  nobles and above, and well it is knowen y^t we have no land but onely  the charity of good people, wherfor nyed constraynyth us to sell the  sylv' y^t is about the same hed. Besechynge yo^r mastership to sertefy  us by y^r tre wher we may sell the said sylv' to repayr [~o]  chyrche.\"[2]        [2] In an inventory made in the reign of Henry VIII. we find          mentioned an image of St Cuthberga, with a ring of gold, and          two little crosses of gold, with a book and staff in her hand.          The head of the image of silver with a crown on it of silver          and gilt. On her apron a St James shell with a buckle of silver          and gilt.    The names of many of the other ecclesiastics connected with the church  are known: among these, we need only mention William Lorynge canon, who  in the time of Richard II. caused the great bell called the Cuthborow  bell to be made; and Simon Beneson, sacrist, who left land, which is  called Bell Acre, towards the maintenance and repair of the bells.    Among other benefactors of the church was Margaret, Countess of  Richmond, mother of Henry VII., so well known at Cambridge under the  name of Lady Margaret, the foundress of Christ's and St John's Colleges.  She founded at Wimborne the original seminary connected with the  minster, which afterwards became by a charter of Elizabeth the Grammar  School of the town, and presented splendid vestments to the church. July  9th was until the Reformation kept at the minster as a festival to her  memory, with a special office and High Mass.    When the deanery was abolished, Wimborne Minster became a Royal  Peculiar, under the administration of three priest-vicars elected by the  Corporation. These served each for a week in turn. The Corporation had  the power of appointing one of the three vicars--who was known as the  \"Official\"--to hold courts and grant licences. The court was held in the  western part of the north aisle, the Official presiding, seated at a  desk, the two other vicars sitting one on each side of him, while at a  long table sat the churchwardens, sidesmen, the vestry clerks, and the  apparitors.    The arrangement by which the vicars served the church each in turn  continued in force until 1876. At that time one of the three vicars  retired on a pension; another removed to the chapelry of Holt,  three miles from Wimborne (which had previously been served in turn  by the vicars of Wimborne), a parsonage having been built for his  accommodation; and the third became sole vicar of the minster church  and the parish attached to it.           *       *       *       *       *    For the history of the fabric we have to trust almost entirely to the  architectural features of the church itself, as documentary evidence is  unusually scanty.    Nothing of earlier date than the twelfth century can be seen in  Wimborne Minster, but we know pretty accurately, the extent and form of  the Norman Church; for, during the course of restoration undertaken in  the present century, the foundations of some parts of this church were  discovered beneath the floor of the existing building, and other pieces  of Norman work formerly concealed, and now again concealed beneath  plaster, were laid bare. There is one interesting feature about the  church worthy of notice--namely, that the builders who succeeded one  another at the various periods of its history did not, as a rule,  destroy the work of their predecessors to such an extent as we  frequently find to have been the case with the builders of other  churches: possibly this may have been due to the fact that at no time  was Wimborne Minster a rich foundation. There was no saintly shrine,  there were no wonder-working relics to attract pilgrims and gather the  offerings of the faithful and enrich the church in the way in which  the shrine of Saint Cuthbert enriched Durham, that of the murdered  archbishop enriched Canterbury, and that of the murdered king enriched  Gloucester. But, whatever the reason may have been, we can but be  thankful that the mediaeval builders destroyed so little at Wimborne;  while we regret that modern restorers have not been as scrupulous in  preserving the work which they found existing, but have in some  instances endeavoured to put the church back again into the state in  which they imagined the fourteenth-century builders left it.    We may regard the arches and lower stages of the central tower as the  oldest part now remaining in its original condition. No doubt the Norman  choir was the first to be built, as we find that it was almost the  universal custom to begin churches at the eastern end, and gradually to  extend the building westward, as funds and time allowed. Here, however,  as in many other cases, the small Norman choir eastward of the central  tower in course of time was considered too small, and the eastern  termination had to be demolished to admit of the desired extension to  the east. Norman choirs, as a rule, had an apsidal termination to the  east, and it was not till Early English times that square east ends,  which were characteristic of the English church in pre-Norman times,  prevailed again over the Norman custom; and it is worthy of notice that  this rectangular termination towards the east end remains a marked  characteristic of the thirteenth-century work in England, Continental  church-builders having retained the apsidal termination till the  Renaissance. The side walls of the Norman choir extended two bays to the  east of the central tower, and the nave four bays westward of the same.  The transepts were shorter than at present, and the side aisles of the  nave narrower. There appear to have been two side chapels to the choir,  extending as far as the first bay eastward; beyond this to the east were  two Norman windows on each side: these windows, parts of which remain,  cut off by the Early English arches, were round-headed, and richly  ornamented with chevron mouldings. They were uncovered at the time of  the restoration, but are now again hidden by plaster. At the south end  of the south transept a low building seems to have existed: the walls  of this were raised when the south transept was lengthened in the  fourteenth century. The Norman masonry may be seen under the south  window of the transept, and a Norman string course runs round the sides  and ends of the present transept. The aisles of the nave were not only  narrower, but were also lower, than those now existing. It is also  probable that these aisles did not originally extend as far westward  as the nave. The windows of the Norman clerestory, which may still be  seen from the interior, though all similar in design, are not alike in  workmanship. The one over the narrow eastern bay on either side differs  from those over the three bays farther to the west. Moreover, a  continuous foundation has been discovered underneath the three western  arches of the Norman nave. Possibly there was at one time a solid wall  in this position, intended, however, from the first only to be  temporary, and this was removed when the aisles, still in Norman times,  were lengthened. The tower itself was not all built at the same time;  the upper stages are ornamented with an arcading of intersecting arches  indicating a somewhat later date.    In the thirteenth century the east end of the choir seems to have been  removed and the presbytery added: its date is pretty clearly determined  by the east window, in which we notice some signs of the approaching  change from the Early English simple lancet into the plate tracery of  the Decorated period. Rickman gives its approximate date as 1220. During  the fourteenth century the nave aisles were widened and extended farther  west, and at the same time two bays were added to the nave itself. The  Norman chapels on either side of the choir were lengthened into aisles,  not, however, extending as far to the east as the thirteenth-century  presbytery; arches were cut in the Norman choir walls to give access  to these new aisles. The transepts were lengthened, the south one by  raising the walls of the Norman chapel mentioned above, which, it has  been conjectured, was used as the Lady Chapel, the north transept by  the addition of Bembre's chantry.    During the fifteenth century the western tower was built 1448-146"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19529"],[0,"Nala and Damayanti and Other Poems (#3)"],[1,"ernly--thus rejoined Nishadha's king--      \"Strictly guarded is yon palace--how may I find entrance there?\"      \"Thou shalt enter;\" thus did Indra--to the unwilling king reply.      In the bower of Damayanti--as they spake, king Nala stood.      There he saw Vidarbha's maiden--girt with all her virgin bands;      In her glowing beauty shining--all excelling in her form;      Every limb in smooth proportion--slender waist and lovely eyes;      Even the moon's soft gleam disdaining--in her own o'erpowering light.      As he gazed, his love grew warmer--to the softly smiling maid,      Yet to keep his truth, his duty--all his passion he suppressed.      Then Nishadha's king beholding--all those maids with beauteous limbs      From their seats sprang up in wonder--at his matchless form amazed.      In their rapture to king Nala--all admiring, homage paid;      Yet, not venturing to accost him,--in their secret souls adored.      \"Oh the beauty! oh the splendour!--oh the mighty hero's strength!      Who is he, or God, or Yaksha--or Gandharba may he be.\"      Not one single word to utter,--dared that fair-limbed maiden band;      All struck dumb before his beauty--in their bashful silence stood.      Smiling, first, upon the monarch--as on her he gently smiled,      Damayanti, in her wonder--to the hero Nala spake:--      \"Who art thou of form so beauteous--thou that wakenest all my love;      Cam'st thou here like an immortal--I would know thee, sinless chief.      How hast entered in our palace?--how hast entered all unseen?      Watchful are our chamber wardens--stern the mandate of the king.\"      By the maiden of Vidarbha--Nala thus addressed, replied:--      \"Know, O loveliest, I am Nala--here the messenger of gods,      Gods desirous to possess thee;--one of these, the lord of heaven      Indra, Agni, Varun, Yama,--choose thou, princess, for thy lord.      Through their power, their power almighty--I have entered here unseen;      As I entered in thy chamber--none hath seen, and none might stay.      This, the object of my mission,--fairest, from the highest gods,      Thou hast heard me, noble princess--even as thou wilt, decide.\"          BOOK IV.          To the gods performed her homage--smiled she, and to Nala spake:--      \"Pledge to me thy faith,[35] O raja--how that faith, may I requite?      I myself, and whatsoever--in the world I have, is thine      In full trust is thine[36]--O grant me--in thy turn thy love, O king!      Tis the swan's enamouring language--that hath kindled all my soul.      Only for thy sake, O hero--are the assembled rajas met.      But if thou mine homage scornest--scornest me, all honoured king,      Poison for thy sake, fire, water,--the vile noose will I endure.\"[37]      So, when spake Vidarbha's maiden--Nala answered thus, and said:--      \"With the world's dread guardians present--wilt thou mortal husband choose?      We with them, the world's creators--with these mighty lords compared,      Lowlier than the dust they tread on--raise to them thy loftier mind.      Man the gods displeasing, hastens--to inevitable death--      Fair limbed! from that fate preserve me--choose the all excelling gods.      Robes by earthly dust unsullied--crowns of amaranthine flowers,      Every bright celestial glory--wedded to the gods, enjoy.      He, who all the world compressing[38]--with devouring might consumes,      Sovereign of the gods, Hutasa,--where is she who would not wed?      He, in awe of whose dread sceptre[39]--all the assembled hosts of men,      Cultivate eternal justice--where is she who would not wed?      Him the all-righteous, lofty minded,--slayer of the infernal host,[40]      Of all gods, the mighty monarch,--who is she that would not wed?      Nor let trembling doubt arrest thee--in thy mind if thou couldst choose.[41]      Varuna, amongst earth's guardians,--hear the language of a friend.\"        To the sovereign of Nishadha--Damayanti spake, and said,      And her eyes grew dim with moisture--flowing from her inward grief:--      \"To the gods, to all, my homage--king of earth, I humbly pay;      Yet thee only, thee, my husband--may I choose, Be this my vow!\"      Answered he the trembling maiden--as with folded hands she stood,      \"Bound upon this solemn mission--mine own cause how dare I urge.      Plighted by a sacred promise--to the everlasting gods;      Thus engaged to plead for others--for myself I may not plead.      This my duty; yet hereafter--come I on my own behalf,      Then I'll plead mine own cause boldly--weigh it, beauteous, in thy thought.\"      Damayanti smiled serenely,--and with tear-impeded speech,      Uttered brokenly and slowly--thus to royal Nala spake:--      \"Yet I see a way of refuge--'tis a blameless way, O king;      Whence no sin to thee, O raja,--may by any chance arise.      Thou, O noblest of all mortals--and the gods by Indra led,      Come and enter in together--where the Swayembara meets;      Then will I, before the presence--of the guardians of the world,      Name thee, lord of men! my husband--nor to thee may blame accrue.\"        By the maiden of Vidarbha--royal Nala thus addressed,      Back again returned, where waited--eager, the expecting gods.      Him, the guardians of the world, the mighty--ere he yet drew near, beheld,      Him they saw, and bade him instant--all his tidings to unfold--      \"Was she seen of thee, O monarch--Damayanti with soft smile?      Spake she of us all? what said she?--tell, O blameless lord of earth.\"        NALA _spake_.        To the bower of Damayanti--on your solemn mission sent,      Entered I the lofty portal--by the aged warders watched;      Mortal eye might not behold me--there as swift I entered in;      None save that fair raja's daughter--through your all prevailing power.      And her virgin handmaids, saw I--and by them in turn was seen;      And they all in mute amazement--gazed upon me as I stood.      I described your godlike presence--but the maid with beauteous face      Chooses me, bereft of reason--O most excellent of gods!      Thus she spake, that maiden princess,--\"Let the gods together come,      Come with thee, Oh king of mortals,--where the Swayembara meets;      There will I, before their presence--choose thee, raja, for my lord.      So to thee, O strong armed warrior--may no blame, no fault ensue.\"      Thus it was, even as I tell you--word for word did it befall.      Plainly have I spoke, the judgment--rests with you, of gods the chief!          BOOK V.          Came the day of happy omen[42]--moonday meet, and moment apt;      Bhima to the Swayembara--summoned all the lords of earth.      One and all, upon the instant--rose th' enamoured lords of earth,      Suitors all to Damayanti--in their loving haste they came.      They, the court with golden columns[43]--rich, and glittering portal arch,      Like the lions on the mountains--entered they the hall of state.      There the lords of earth were seated--each upon his several throne;      All their fragrant garlands wearing--all with pendant ear-gems rich.      Arms were seen robust and vigorous--as the ponderous battle mace,      Some like the five-headed serpents--delicate in shape and hue:[44]      With bright locks profuse and flowing--fine formed nose, and eye and brow,      Shone the faces of the rajas--like the radiant stars in heaven.      As with serpents, Bhogavati[45]--the wide hall was full of kings;      As the mountain caves with tigers--with the tiger-warriors full.      Damayanti in her beauty--entered on that stately scene,      With her dazzling light entrancing--every eye and every soul.      O'er her lovely person gliding--all the eyes of those proud kings;      There were fixed, there moveless rested--as they gazed upon the maid.      Then as they proclaimed the rajas--(by his name was each proclaimed)      In dismay saw Bhima's daughter--five in garb, in form the same.      On those forms, all undistinguished--each from each, she stood and gazed.      In her doubt Vidarbha's princess--Nala's form might not discern,[46]      Whichsoe'er the form she gazed on--him her Nala, him she thought.      She within her secret spirit--deeply pondering, stood and thought:      \"How shall I the gods distinguish?--royal Nala how discern?\"      Pondering thus Vidarbha's maiden--in the anguish of her heart--      Th' attributes of the immortals--sought, as heard of yore, to see.      \"Th' attributes of each celestial--that our aged sires describe,      As on earth they stand before me--not of one may I discern.\"      Long she pondered in her silence--and again, again she thought.      To the gods, her only refuge--turned she at this trying hour.      With her voice and with her spirit--she her humble homage paid.      Folding both her hands and trembling--to the gods the maiden spake:      \"As when heard the swan's sweet language--chose I then Nishadha's king,      By this truth I here adjure ye--oh, ye gods, reveal my lord;      As in word or thought I swerve not--from my faith, all-knowing powers,      By this truth I here adjure ye--oh, ye gods, reveal my lord.      As the gods themselves have destined--for my lord Nishadha's king;      By this truth I here adjure ye--oh, ye gods, my lord reveal.      As my vow, so pledged to Nala--holily must be maintained,      By this truth I here adjure ye--oh, ye gods, my lord reveal.      Each the form divine assume ye--earth's protectors, mighty lords;      So shall I discern my Nala--I shall know the king of men.\"        As they heard sad Damayanti--uttering thus her piteous prayer,      At her high resolve they wonder--steadfast truth and fervent love,      Holiness of soul, and wisdom--to her lord her constant faith.      As she prayed, the gods obedient--stood with attributes revealed:      With unmoistened skins the Immortals--saw she, and with moveless eyes;[47]      Fresh their dust-unsullied garlands--hovered they, nor touched the earth."]]]
