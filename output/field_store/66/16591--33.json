We can discover  a no less distinct gradation in the character of the opposition it has had  to encounter--an opposition, at first kindled in the bosom of _Sh_i'ah  Islam, which, at a later stage, gathered momentum with the banishment of  Baha'u'llah to the domains of the Turkish Sultan and the consequent  hostility of the more powerful Sunni hierarchy and its Caliph, the head of  the vast majority of the followers of Muhammad--an opposition which, now,  through the rise of a divinely appointed Order in the Christian West, and  its initial impact on civil and ecclesiastical institutions, bids fair to  include among its supporters established governments and systems  associated with the most ancient, the most deeply entrenched sacerdotal  hierarchies in Christendom. We can, at the same time, recognize, through  the haze of an ever-widening hostility, the progress, painful yet  persistent, of certain communities within its pale through the stages of  obscurity, of proscription, of emancipation, and of recognition--stages  that must needs culminate in the course of succeeding centuries, in the  establishment of the Faith, and the founding, in the plenitude of its  power and authority, of the world-embracing Baha'i Commonwealth. We can  likewise discern a no less appreciable advance in the rise of its  institutions, whether as administrative centers or places of  worship--institutions, clandestine and subterrene in their earliest  beginnings, emerging imperceptibly into the broad daylight of public  recognition, legally protected, enriched by pious endowments, ennobled at  first by the erection of the Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar of I_sh_qabad, the  first Baha'i House of Worship, and more recently immortalized, through the  rise in the heart of the North American continent of the Mother Temple of  the West, the forerunner of a divine, a slowly maturing civilization. And  finally, we can even bear witness to the marked improvement in the  conditions surrounding the pilgrimages performed by its devoted adherents  to its consecrated shrines at its world center--pilgrimages originally  arduous, perilous, tediously long, often made on foot, at times ending in  disappointment, and confined to a handful of harassed Oriental followers,  gradually attracting, under steadily improving circumstances of security  and comfort, an ever swelling number of new converts converging from the  four corners of the globe, and culminating in the widely publicized yet  sadly frustrated visit of a noble Queen, who, at the very threshold of the  city of her heart's desire, was compelled, according to her own written  testimony, to divert her steps, and forego the privilege of so priceless a  benefit.            FIRST PERIOD: THE MINISTRY OF THE BAB 1844-1853          Chapter I: The Birth of the Babi Revelation      May 23, 1844, signalizes the commencement of the most turbulent period of  the Heroic Age of the Baha'i Era, an age which marks the opening of the  most glorious epoch in the greatest cycle which the spiritual history of  mankind has yet witnessed. No more than a span of nine short years marks  the duration of this most spectacular, this most tragic, this most  eventful period of the first Baha'i century. It was ushered in by the  birth of a Revelation whose Bearer posterity will acclaim as the \"Point  round Whom the realities of the Prophets and Messengers revolve,\" and  terminated with the first stirrings of a still more potent Revelation,  \"whose day,\" Baha'u'llah Himself affirms, \"every Prophet hath announced,\"  for which \"the soul of every Divine Messenger hath thirsted,\" and through  which \"God hath proved the hearts of the entire company of His Messengers  and Prophets.\" Little wonder that the immortal chronicler of the events  associated with the birth and rise of the Baha'i Revelation has seen fit  to devote no less than half of his moving narrative to the description of  those happenings that have during such a brief space of time so greatly  enriched, through their tragedy and heroism, the religious annals of  mankind. In sheer dramatic power, in the rapidity with which events of  momentous importance succeeded each other, in the holocaust which baptized  its birth, in the miraculous circumstances attending the martyrdom of the  One Who had ushered it in, in the potentialities with which it had been  from the outset so thoroughly impregnated, in the forces to which it  eventually gave birth, this nine-year period may well rank as unique in  the whole range of man's religious experience. We behold, as we survey the  episodes of this first act of a sublime drama, the figure of its Master  Hero, the Bab, arise meteor-like above the horizon of _Sh_iraz, traverse  the sombre sky of Persia from south to north, decline with tragic  swiftness, and perish in a blaze of glory. We see His satellites, a galaxy  of God-intoxicated heroes, mount above that same horizon, irradiate that  same incandescent light, burn themselves out with that self-same  swiftness, and impart in their turn an added impetus to the steadily  gathering momentum of God's nascent Faith.    He Who communicated the original impulse to so incalculable a Movement was  none other than the promised Qa'im (He who ariseth), the Sahibu'z-Zaman  (the Lord of the Age), Who assumed the exclusive right of annulling the  whole Qur'anic Dispensation, Who styled Himself \"the Primal Point from  which have been generated all created things ... the Countenance of God  Whose splendor can never be obscured, the Light of God Whose radiance can  never fade.\" The people among whom He appeared were the most decadent race  in the civilized world, grossly ignorant, savage, cruel, steeped in  prejudice, servile in their submission to an almost deified hierarchy,  recalling in their abjectness the Israelites of Egypt in the days of  Moses, in their fanaticism the Jews in the days of Jesus, and in their  perversity the idolators of Arabia in the days of Muhammad. The arch-enemy  who repudiated His claim, challenged His authority, persecuted His Cause,  succeeded in almost quenching His light, and who eventually became  disintegrated under the impact of His Revelation was the _Sh_i'ah  priesthood. Fiercely fanatic, unspeakably corrupt, enjoying unlimited  ascendancy over the masses, jealous of their position, and irreconcilably  opposed to all liberal ideas, the members of this caste had for one  thousand years invoked the name of the Hidden Imam, their breasts had  glowed with the expectation of His advent, their pulpits had rung with the  praises of His world-embracing dominion, their lips were still devoutly  and perpetually murmuring prayers for the hastening of His coming. The  willing tools who prostituted their high office for the accomplishment of  the enemy's designs were no less than the sovereigns of the Qajar dynasty,  first, the bigoted, the sickly, the vacillating Muhammad _Sh_ah, who at  the last moment cancelled the Bab's imminent visit to the capital, and,  second, the youthful and inexperienced Nasiri'd-Din _Sh_ah, who gave his  ready assent to the sentence of his Captive's death. The arch villains who  joined hands with the prime movers of so wicked a conspiracy were the two  grand vizirs, Haji Mirza Aqasi, the idolized tutor of Muhammad _Sh_ah, a  vulgar, false-hearted and fickle-minded schemer, and the arbitrary,  bloodthirsty, reckless Amir-Nizam, Mirza Taqi _Kh_an, the first of whom  exiled the Bab to the mountain fastnesses of A_dh_irbayjan, and the latter  decreed His death in Tabriz. Their accomplice in these and other heinous  crimes was a government bolstered up by a flock of idle, parasitical  princelings and governors, corrupt, incompetent, tenaciously holding to  their ill-gotten privileges, and utterly subservient to a notoriously  degraded clerical order. The heroes whose deeds shine upon the record of  this fierce spiritual contest, involving at once people, clergy, monarch  and government, were the Bab's chosen disciples, the Letters of the  Living, and their companions, the trail-breakers of the New Day, who to so  much intrigue, ignorance, depravity, cruelty, superstition and cowardice  opposed a spirit exalted, unquenchable and awe-inspiring, a knowledge  surprisingly profound, an eloquence sweeping in its force, a piety  unexcelled in fervor, a courage leonine in its fierceness, a  self-abnegation saintly in its purity, a resolve granite-like in its  firmness, a vision stupendous in its range, a veneration for the Prophet  and His Imams disconcerting to their adversaries, a power of persuasion  alarming to their antagonists, a standard of faith and a code of conduct  that challenged and revolutionized the lives of their countrymen.    The opening scene of the initial act of this great drama was laid in the  upper chamber of the modest residence of the son of a mercer of _Sh_iraz,  in an obscure corner of that city. The time was the hour before sunset, on  the 22nd day of May, 1844. The participants were the Bab, a twenty-five  year old siyyid, of pure and holy lineage, and the young Mulla Husayn, the  first to believe in Him. Their meeting immediately before that interview  seemed to be purely fortuitous. The interview itself was protracted till  the hour of dawn. The Host remained closeted alone with His guest, nor was  the sleeping city remotely aware of the import of the conversation they  held with each other. No record has passed to posterity of that unique  night save the fragmentary but highly illuminating account that fell from  the lips of Mulla Husayn.    \"I sat spellbound by His utterance, oblivious of time and of those who  awaited me,\" he himself has testified, after describing the nature of the  questions he had put to his Host and the conclusive replies he had  received from Him, replies which had established beyond the shadow of a  doubt the validity of His claim to be the promised Qa'im. \"Suddenly the  call of the Mu'a_dhdh_i"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19279"],[0,"Memorials of the Faithful (#3)"],[1,"you will find him dry in the sea.\" That is how he was. His life hung  by a thread from one moment to the next; the malevolent lay in wait for  him; he was known everywhere as a Baha'i--and still he was protected from  all harm. He stayed dry in the depths of the sea, cool and safe in the  heart of the fire, until the day he died.    After the ascension of Baha'u'llah, Mulla 'Ali continued on, loyal to the  Testament of the Light of the World, staunch in the Covenant which he  served and heralded. During the lifetime of the Manifestation, his  yearning made him hasten to Baha'u'llah, Who received him with grace and  favor, and showered blessings upon him. He returned, then, to Iran, where  he devoted all his time to serving the Cause. Openly at odds with his  tyrannical oppressors, no matter how often they threatened him, he defied  them. He was never vanquished. Whatever he had to say, he said. He was one  of the Hands of the Cause of God, steadfast, unshakable, not to be moved.    I loved him very much, for he was delightful to converse with, and as a  companion second to none. One night, not long ago, I saw him in the world  of dreams. Although his frame had always been massive, in the dream world  he appeared larger and more corpulent than ever. It seemed as if he had  returned from a journey. I said to him, \"Jinab, you have grown good and  stout.\" \"Yes,\" he answered, \"praise be to God! I have been in places where  the air was fresh and sweet, and the water crystal pure; the landscapes  were beautiful to look upon, the foods delectable. It all agreed with me,  of course, so I am stronger than ever now, and I have recovered the zest  of my early youth. The breaths of the All-Merciful blew over me and all my  time was spent in telling of God. I have been setting forth His proofs,  and teaching His Faith.\" (The meaning of teaching the Faith in the next  world is spreading the sweet savors of holiness; that action is the same  as teaching.) We spoke together a little more, and then some people  arrived and he disappeared.    His last resting-place is in Tihran. Although his body lies under the  earth, his pure spirit lives on, \"in the seat of truth, in the presence of  the potent King.\"(5) I long to visit the graves of the friends of God,  could this be possible. These are the servants of the Blessed Beauty; in  His path they were afflicted; they met with toil and sorrow; they  sustained injuries and suffered harm. Upon them be the glory of God, the  All-Glorious. Unto them be salutation and praise. Upon them be God's  tender mercy, and forgiveness.            SHAYKH SALMAN      In 1266 A.H.(6) the trusted messenger, _Sh_ay_kh_ Salman, first heard the  summons of God, and his heart leapt for joy. He was then in Hindiyan.  Irresistibly attracted, he walked all the way to Tihran, where with ardent  love he secretly joined the believers. On a certain day he was passing  through the bazar with Aqa Muhammad Taqiy-i-Ka_sh_ani, and the farra_sh_es  followed him and discovered where he lived. The next day, police and  farra_sh_es came looking for him and took him to the chief of police.    \"Who are you?\" the chief asked.    \"I am from Hindiyan,\" replied Salman. \"I have come to Tihran and am on my  way to _Kh_urasan, for a pilgrimage to the Shrine of Imam Rida.\"    \"What were you doing yesterday,\" the chief asked, \"with that man in the  white robe?\"    Salman answered, \"I had sold him an 'aba the day before, and yesterday he  was to pay me.\"    \"You are a stranger here,\" the chief said. \"How could you trust him?\"    \"A money-changer guaranteed the payment,\" Salman replied. He had in mind  the respected believer, Aqa Muhammad-i-Sarraf (money-changer).    The chief turned to one of his farra_sh_es and said, \"Take him to the  money-changer's and look into it.\"    When they reached there the farra_sh_ went on ahead. \"What was all this,\"  he said, \"about the sale of an 'aba and your vouching for the payment?  Explain yourself.\"    \"I know nothing about it,\" the money-changer replied. \"Come along,\" said  the farra_sh_ to Salman. \"All is clear at last. You are a Babi.\"    It happened that the turban which Salman had on his head was similar to  those worn in _Sh_u_sh_tar. As they were passing a crossroads, a man from  _Sh_u_sh_tar came out of his shop. He embraced Salman and cried: \"Where  have you been, _Kh_ajih Muhammad-'Ali? When did you arrive? Welcome!\"    Salman replied, \"I came here a few days ago and now the police have  arrested me.\"    \"What do you want with him?\" the merchant asked the farra_sh_. \"What are  you after?\"    \"He is a Babi,\" was the answer. \"God forbid!\" cried the man from  _Sh_u_sh_tar. \"I know him well. _Kh_ajih Muhammad-'Ali is a God-fearing  Muslim, a _Sh_i'ih, a devout follower of the Imam 'Ali.\" With this he gave  the farra_sh_ a sum of money and Salman was freed.    They went into the shop and the merchant began to ask Salman how he was  faring. Salman told him: \"I am not _Kh_ajih Muhammad-'Ali.\"    The man from _Sh_u_sh_tar was dumbfounded. \"You look exactly like him!\" he  exclaimed. \"You two are identical. However, since you are not he, give me  back the money I paid the farra_sh_.\"    Salman immediately handed him the money, left, went out through the city  gate and made for Hindiyan.    When Baha'u'llah arrived in 'Iraq, the first messenger to reach His holy  presence was Salman, who then returned with Tablets addressed to the  friends in Hindiyan. Once each year, this blessed individual would set out  on foot to see his Well-Beloved, after which he would retrace his steps,  carrying Tablets to many cities, Isfahan, _Sh_iraz, Ka_sh_an, Tihran, and  the rest.    From the year 69 until the ascension of Baha'u'llah in 1309 A.H.,(7)  Salman would arrive once a year, bringing letters, leaving with the  Tablets, faithfully delivering each one to him for whom it was intended.  Every single year throughout that long period, he came on foot from Persia  to 'Iraq, or to Adrianople, or to the Most Great Prison at Akka; came with  the greatest eagerness and love, and then went back again.    He had remarkable powers of endurance. He traveled on foot, as a rule  eating nothing but onions and bread; and in all that time, he moved about  in such a way that he was never once held up and never once lost a letter  or a Tablet. Every letter was safely delivered; every Tablet reached its  intended recipient. Over and over again, in Isfahan, he was subjected to  severe trials, but he remained patient and thankful under all conditions,  and earned from non-Baha'is the title of \"the Babis' Angel Gabriel.\"    Throughout his entire life, Salman rendered this momentous service to the  Cause of God, becoming the means of its spread and contributing to the  happiness of the believers, annually bringing Divine glad tidings to the  cities and villages of Persia. He was close to the heart of Baha'u'llah,  Who looked upon him with especial favor and grace. Among the Holy  Scriptures, there are Tablets revealed in his name.    After the ascension of Baha'u'llah, Salman remained faithful to the  Covenant, serving the Cause with all his powers. Then, as before, he would  come to the Most Great Prison every year, delivering mail from the  believers, and returning with the answers to Persia. At last, in _Sh_iraz,  he winged his way to the Kingdom of glory.    From the dawn of history until the present day, there has never been a  messenger so worthy of trust; there has never been a courier to compare  with Salman. He has left respected survivors in Isfahan who, because of  the troubles in Persia, are presently in distress. It is certain that the  friends will see to their needs. Upon him be the glory of God, the  All-Glorious; unto him be salutations and praise.            MIRZA MUHAMMAD-'ALI, THE AFNAN      In the days of Baha'u'llah, during the worst times in the Most Great  Prison, they would not permit any of the friends either to leave the  Fortress or to come in from the outside. \"Skew-Cap\"(8) and the Siyyid(9)  lived by the second gate of the city, and watched there at all times, day  and night. Whenever they spied a Baha'i traveler they would hurry away to  the Governor and tell him that the traveler was bringing in letters and  would carry the answers back. The Governor would then arrest the traveler,  seize his papers, jail him, and drive him out. This became an established  custom with the authorities and went on for a long time--indeed, for nine  years until, little by little, the practice was abandoned.    It was at such a period that the Afnan, Haji Mirza Muhammad-'Ali--that  great bough of the Holy Tree(10)--journeyed to Akka, coming from India to  Egypt, and from Egypt to Marseilles. One day I was up on the roof of the  caravanserai. Some of the friends were with me and I was walking up and  down. It was sunset. At that moment, glancing at the distant seashore, I  observed that a carriage was approaching. \"Gentlemen,\" I said, \"I feel  that a holy being is in that carriage.\" It was still far away, hardly  within sight.    \"Let us go to the gate,\" I told them. \"Although they will not allow us to  pass through, we can stand there till he comes.\" I took one or two people  with me and we left.    At the city gate I called to the guard, privately gave him something and  said: \"A carriage is coming in and I think it is bringing one of our  friends. When it reaches here, do not hold it up, and do not refer the  matter to the Governor.\" He put out a chair for me and I sat down.    By this time the sun had set. They had shut the main gate, too, but the  little door was open. The gatekeeper stayed outside, the carriage drew up,  the gentleman had arrived. What a radiant face he had! He was nothing but  light from head to foot. Just to look at that face made one happy; he was  so confident, so assured, so rooted in his faith, and his expression so  joyous. He was truly a blessed being. He was a man who made progress day"]]]
