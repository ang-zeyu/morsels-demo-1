[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20318"],[0,"Little Journeys to the Homes of the Great - Volume 14 (#3)"],[1,"works out at length the  favorite recurring theme of Morris: work is for the worker, and art is  the expression of man's joy in his work.    In Eighteen Hundred Forty-four, when Morris was ten years of age, Wagner  wrote:    \"I compose for myself; it is just a question between me and my Maker. I  grow as I exercise my faculties, and expression is a necessary form of  spiritual exercise. How shall I live? Express what I think or feel, or  what you feel?    \"No, I must be honest and sincere. I must, for the need of myself, live  my own life, for work is for the worker, at the last. Each man must  please himself, and Nature has placed her approbation on this by  supplying the greatest pleasure men ever know as a reward for doing good  work. I hate this fast-growing tendency to chain men to machines in big  factories and deprive them of all joy in their efforts--the plan will  lead to cheap men and cheap products. I set my face against it and plead  for the dignity and health of the open air, and the olden time.\"    This sort of talk led straight to Wagner's arrest in the streets of  Dresden on the charge of inciting a riot; and it was the identical line  of argument that caused the arrest of Morris in Trafalgar Square,  London, when he was taken struggling to the station-house.    Wagner was exiled and Morris merely \"cautioned,\" placed under police  surveillance and ostracized. The difference in time explains the  difference in punishment. A century earlier and both men would have  forfeited their heads.    In all of Wagner's operas the scene is laid at a time when the  festivals, games and religious ceremonies were touched with the thought  of beauty. Men were strong, plain, blunt and honest. Affectation,  finesse, pretense and veneer were unknown. Art had not resolved itself  into the possession of a class of idlers and dilettantes who hired  long-haired men and fussy girls in Greek gowns to make pretty things for  them. All worked with their hands, through need, and when they made  things they worked for utility and beauty. They gave things a beautiful  form, because men and women worked together, and for each other. And  wherever men and women work together we find Beauty. Men who live only  with other men are never beautiful in their work, or speech, or lives,  neither are women. But at this early time life was largely communal,  natural, and Art was the possession of all, because all had a share in  its production. Observe the setting of any Wagner opera where Walter  Damrosch has his way and get that flavor of bold, free, wholesome,  honest Beauty. And yet no stage was ever large enough to quite satisfy  Wagner, and all the properties, if he had had his way, would have been  works of Art, thought out in detail and materialized for the purpose by  human hands.    Now turn to \"The Story of the Glittering Plain,\" \"Gertha's Lovers,\"  \"News From Nowhere\" or \"The Hollow Land,\" by William Morris, and note  the same stage-setting, the same majesty, dignity and sense of power.  Observe the great underlying sense of joy in life, the gladness of mere  existence. A serenity and peace pervades the work of both of these men;  they are mystic, fond of folklore and legend; they live in the open, are  deeply religious without knowing it, have nothing they wish to conceal,  and are one with Nature in all her many moods and manifestations--sons  of God!           *       *       *       *       *    In the history of letters there is a writer by the name of Green, who  exists simply because he reviled a contemporary poet by the name of  Shakespeare. Green's name is embalmed in immortal amber with that of  Richard Quiney, who wrote a letter to the author of \"The Tempest\"  begging the favor of a loan of forty pounds.    There are several ways of winning fame. Joseph Jefferson has written in  classic style of Count Johannes and James Owen O'Connor, who played  \"Hamlet\" to large and enthusiastic audiences, behind a wire screen; then  there was John Doe, who fired the Alexandrian Library, and Richard Roe,  the man who struck Billy Patterson. Besides these we have the Reverend  Obadiah Simmons of Nashville, Tennessee, who, in Eighteen Hundred Sixty,  produced a monograph proving that negroes had no souls, the value of  which work, to be sure, is slightly vitiated when we remember that the  same arguments were used, in Seventeen Hundred One, by Bishop Volberg,  in showing that women were in a like predicament.    And now Henry T. Finck has compiled a list of more than one hundred  names of musical critics who placed themselves on record in opposition  to Richard Wagner and his music. Only such men as proved themselves past  masters in density and adepts in abuse are given a place in this Academy  of Immortals.    No writer, musician or artist who ever lived brought down on his head  an equal amount of contumely and disparagement as did Richard Wagner.  Turner, Millet and Rodin have been let off lightly compared with the  fate that was Wagner's; and even the shrill outcry that was raised in  Boston at sight of MacMonnies' Bacchante was a passing zephyr to the  storm that broke over the head of Wagner in Paris, when, after one  hundred sixteen rehearsals, \"Tannhauser\" was produced.    The derisive laughter, catcalls, shouts, hisses and uproar that greeted  the play were only the shadow of the criticisms that filled the daily  press, done by writers who mistook their own anserine limitations for  inanity on the part of the composer. They scorned the melody they could  not appreciate, like men who deny the sounds they can not hear; or those  who might revile the colors they could not distinguish. And worse than  all this, the aristocratic hoodlums refused to allow any one else to  enjoy, and would not tolerate the thought that that which to them was  \"jumbling discord, seven times confounded\" might be a succession of  harmonies to one whose perceptions were more fully developed.    Wagner himself only escaped personal violence by discreetly keeping out  of sight. The result of the Paris experiment was that the poor man lost  nearly a year's time, all of his modest savings were gone, creditors  dogged his footsteps, and the unanimous tone of the critics, for a time,  almost made him doubt his own sanity. What if the critics were really  right?    And this, we must remember, was in Eighteen Hundred Sixty-one, when  Wagner was forty-eight years of age.    That even a strong man should doubt his value when he finds a world of  learned men arrayed against him is not strange. Every man who works in a  creative way craves approbation. Some one must approve. After the first  fever of ecstasy there comes the reaction, when the pulse beats slow and  the mind is filled with doubt and melancholy. This desire for approval  is not a weakness--it seems to stand as a natural need of every human  soul. When the great Peg Woffington played, you remember, she begged Sir  Henry Vane to stand in the wings so as to meet her when she came off the  stage, take her in his arms just for an instant, kiss her on the  forehead and say, \"Well done!\"    Shallow people may smile at such a scene as this, but those who have  delved in the realm of creative art know this fervent need of a word of  encouragement from One who Understands.    The one man who held the mirror up to Nature for Wagner was Franz Liszt.  Were it not for the steadfast love and faith of this noble soul, Wagner  must surely have fallen by the way. Wagner worked first to please  himself, and having pleased himself he knew it would please Franz Liszt,  and having pleased Franz Liszt he knew it would please all those as  great, noble, excellent and pure in heart as Franz Liszt. To speak to  an audience made up of such as Liszt, and have them approve, was the  sublime dream and hope of Richard Wagner.    Some of the enemies of Wagner, having placed themselves on record  against the man, have sought to make out that Wagner and Liszt often  quarreled, but this canard has now all been exploded. Such another  friendship between two strong men I can not recall. That of Goethe and  Schiller seems a mere acquaintanceship, and the friendship of Carlyle  and Emerson a literary correspondence with an eye on posterity, as  compared with this bond of brotherhood that existed between Wagner and  Liszt.    During the ten years of Wagner's exile in Switzerland he received barely  enough from his work in music to support him, and several times he would  have been in sore need were it not for the \"loans\" made him by Liszt. He  did not even own a piano, and never heard his scores played, except when  Liszt made a semi-yearly visit. At such times a piano would be borrowed,  and the friends would revel in the new scores, and occasionally talk the  entire night away.    When Liszt would go home after such visits, Wagner would go off on long  tramps, climbing the mountains, lonely and bereft, sure that the mood  for high and splendid work would never come again. Then some morning the  mist would roll away, the old spirit would come back, and he would apply  himself with all the intense fire and burning imagination of which his  spirit was capable.    When the score was done it was sent straight to Liszt, before the ink  was dry.    The \"Lohengrin\" manuscript was sent along in parts, and Liszt was the  first man to interpret it. On one such occasion we find Liszt writing:  \"Your 'Walkure' has arrived--and gladly would I sing to you with a  thousand voices your 'Lohengrin Chorus'--a wonder, a wonder! Dearest  Richard, you are surely a divine man, and my highest joy is to follow  you in your flight and be one with you in spirit!\"    On this occasion, when the \"Lohengrin Chorus\" first found voice, the  only auditor was the Princess von Wittgenstein, who added a postscript  to Liszt's letter, thus: \"I wept bitter tears over the scene between  Siegmund and Sieglinde! This is beautiful--like heaven, like earth--like"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20346"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Winchester (#3)"],[1,"old minster, and before the end of the year they  demolished the whole of it, with the exception of one apse and the high  altar.\" When the old high altar was pulled down, we are told, \"the  relics of many saints were found.\" The cathedral, as Walkelin designed  it, was for the most part so strong that its core and much of its actual  work remains to this day; but the central tower lacked the stability of  the rest, for on October 7, 1107, during the vacancy which occurred  after Walkelin's death, it fell. The monkish chroniclers attributed the  fall to the fact that William Rufus, \"who all his life had been profane  and sensual and had expired without the Christian viaticum\" (Rudborne),  was interred beneath it in 1100. William of Malmesbury, however, with a  degree of incredulity rare in his days, says it may have been that it  would have fallen in any case \"through imperfect construction.\" He  describes the burial thus:--\"A few countrymen conveyed the body, placed  on a cart, to the cathedral of Winchester, the blood dripping from it  all the way. Here it was committed to the ground within the tower,  attended by many of the nobility, but lamented by few. The next year the  tower fell; though I forbear to mention the different opinions on this  subject, lest I should seem to assent too readily to unsupported  trifles.\"    After Walkelin's death the history of the building is lost sight of for  some time, owing to the continual disturbances which all England was  undergoing. With De Lucy's accession, however, in 1189, considerable  additions were made to the cathedral, in the form of the Early English  retro-choir, of which the details are given later in this volume. De  Lucy's work, it has been pointed out, was carried out in such a way as  to leave the Norman building undisturbed as long as it was practicable  to do so, the circular apse being left _in situ_ until the new external  walls had been erected, while the presbytery itself was not touched  until the Decorated Period set in. De Lucy would doubtless have made  further alterations but for his death in 1204. As it was, two years  before that event he instituted a confraternity to carry on his work for  the space of five years, and to this body is due some of the work which  is attributed loosely to him.    It was during De Lucy's tenure of Winchester that Richard was re-crowned  by the Archbishop of Canterbury after his return from captivity. He  passed the night before at S. Swithun's Priory, and was brought thence  in the morning to the Cathedral \"clothed in his royal robes, with the  crown upon his head, holding in his right hand a royal sceptre which  terminated in a cross, and in his left hand a golden wand with a figure  of a dove at the top of it, ... being conducted on the right hand by his  chancellor, the Bishop of Ely, and on the left by the Bishop of London\"  (Roger de Hoveden). The Bishop of Winchester himself does not seem to  have been present, probably on account of a dispute with the king.    Another period of disturbance follows the comparatively quiet rule of  Bishop De Lucy, and it is not until we reach 1346 that we come to a  fresh outburst of architectural zeal on the part of the incumbents of  Winchester. But Edingdon, and still more his successor Wykeham, left  very lasting monuments of their occupancy at Winchester. It must not be  forgotten that, while to Wykeham is due the credit of most of the actual  transformation of the building, Edingdon must have first conceived,  however vaguely, the design. Edingdon's attachment to Winchester is well  illustrated by his quaint reason for refusing the offer of Canterbury:  \"if Canterbury is the higher rack, Winchester is the better manger.\" He  is, indeed, charged with having left a considerable debt on the  building, since his successor seems to have recovered a large sum from  his executors, who had also to compensate Wykeham for large numbers of  cattle which had \"disappeared from the various farms of the bishopric.\"  Yet it appears from Edingdon's own will that he began rebuilding the  nave and left money for the continuation of the work.    Wykeham, as we shall see, had already a reputation for architectural  skill when first introduced to Edward III., and this reputation stood  him in good stead in the matter of preferment. When he was elected to  Winchester he found the bishop's palaces of Farnham, Wolvesey, Waltham,  and Southwark in a very dilapidated condition, and he set these in order  before he turned his attention to anything else. New College, Oxford,  and Winchester College practically occupied him up to 1393; whilst his  work in the cathedral was really the last great undertaking of his life,  inasmuch as it was not finished at the time of his death. The actual  method of Wykeham's transformation of the interior is described more  fully elsewhere, and we will not therefore do more than quote a few  words from Willis on the work done. \"The old Norman cathedral was cast  nearly throughout its length and breadth into a new form; the double  tier of arches in its peristyle was turned into one, by the removal of  the lower arch, and clothed with Caen casings in the Perpendicular  style. The old wooden ceilings were replaced with stone vaultings,  enriched with elegant carvings and cognizances. Scarcely less than a  total rebuilding is involved in this hazardous and expensive operation,  carried on during ten years with a systematic order worthy of remark and  imitation.... Judging from the provision of his will of the expenditure  for the last year and a half, the cost of this great work to the bishop  in present money cannot be estimated at less than L200,000.\"    Wykeham's successor, Beaufort, was far less a bishop of Winchester than  an English statesman. His contributions to the architecture of his see  are very small. He did indeed so add to the hospital of St Cross as to  make it almost a new foundation; but in the cathedral he only left one  monument, though this Milner styles the \"most elegant and finished  chantry in the kingdom,\" lying on the south side of the retro-choir.  Waynflete, who followed him, left another fine chantry in a  corresponding position to the north. Under Bishops Peter Courtenay and  Thomas Langton, the latter of whom has his chapel at the east end, next  the Lady Chapel, considerable additions were made to the architecture of  the cathedral, though most of the credit is due to the priors Hunton and  Silkstede, who seem to have been chiefly responsible for the new work.  This included a prolongation of De Lucy's Lady Chapel, carried out in  all probability between the years 1470 and 1524; and the erection of the  present side aisles of the presbytery, in place of the original Norman  aisles. In the latter year (1524) the side screens of the presbytery  were added by Bishop Fox, whose motto can be read on them. The work of  Fox, whose chapel is behind the reredos to the south, began in 1510, and  was carried out under early Renaissance influence. He found the choir  and presbytery converted, to a great extent, to the Decorated style,  though the Norman aisles remained. He completed the transformation,  adding the above-mentioned screens, together with a wooden vaulting. He  would probably have also replaced with his own work De Lucy's additions  at the east end and the Norman transepts, had he but had the time. This,  however, he did not live long enough to do, for he died in 1528. Roughly  speaking, his work lies between the transepts and the Early English east  end.    The Reformation Period did not benefit much to the architectural  features of Winchester Cathedral, while it most certainly did them harm.  \"The bones of S. Swithun,\" says Woodward, \"were doubtless lost at the  Reformation, when his costly shrine was taken from the feretory, where  it stood so long, and destroyed.\" The period was now at hand when many  seem to have considered it a religious duty to destroy monuments, or at  least deface them; and Winchester, though it suffered less than many  churches, by no means escaped damage. Under Stephen Gardiner, however,  no great evil befell the building. Gardiner's own chantry behind the  reredos commemorates his connection with the cathedral, and distinctly  illustrates the inferior taste of his day, when compared with the  earlier tombs about him; though it might easily have been far worse. The  Puritans maltreated it on other grounds than those of taste, it is to be  feared. It was during Bishop Gardiner's tenure of the see that Philip of  Spain and Mary were married at Winchester. Contemporary records by a  Spaniard in Philip's suite, and by an English observer of the same date,  recently revealed to us by Mr Martin A.S. Hume, set forth the story of  the marriage most vividly. The king arrived from Southampton in a storm  of rain, and \"donned a black velvet surcoat covered with gold bugles and  a suit of white velvet trimmed in the same way, and thus he entered,  passing the usual red-clothed kneeling aldermen with gold keys on  cushions, and then to the grand cathedral, which impressed the Spaniards  with wonder, and above all to find that 'Mass was as solemnly sung there  as at Toledo.' A little crowd of mitred bishops stood at the great west  door, crosses raised and censers swinging, and in solemn procession to  the high altar, under a velvet canopy, they led the man whom they looked  upon as God's chosen instrument to permanently restore their faith in  England.\" Two days after the wedding took place. Great attention is paid  to the clothes by both English and Spanish narrators, and the ceremony  and dresses were very magnificent; the Queen's ladies \"looked more like  celestial angels than mortal creatures.\" The Queen, we are told, blazed  with jewels to such an extent that the eye was blinded as it looked upon  her; her dress was of black velvet flashing with gems, and a splendid  mantle of cloth of gold fell from her "]]]
