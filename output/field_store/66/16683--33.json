[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20660"],[0,"The Faith of Islam (#3)"],[1,"\"by this  the Prophet means that such a wonderful miracle as the Quran, which is also  a revelation, should carry conviction to a very large number.\"[7] To a  Muslim the fact is quite clear, and so to him the Quran is far superior to  all the preceding books. Muhammad is said to have convinced a rival, Lebid,  a poet-laureate, of the truth of his mission by reciting to him a portion  of the now second Sura. \"Unquestionably it is one of the very grandest  specimens of Koranic or Arabic diction.... But even descriptions of this  kind, grand as they be, are not sufficient to kindle and preserve the  enthusiasm and the faith and the hope of a nation like the Arabs.... The  poets before him had sung of valour and generosity, of love and strife and  revenge ... of early graves, upon which weeps the morning cloud, and of the  fleeting nature of life which comes and goes as the waves of the desert  sands, as the tents of a caravan, as a flower that shoots up and dies away.  Or they shoot their bitter arrows of satire right into the enemy's own  soul. Muhammad sang of none of these. No love-minstrelsy his, not the joys  of the world, nor sword, nor camel, nor jealousy, nor human vengeance, not  the glories of tribe or ancestor. He preached Islam.\" The very fierceness  with which this is done, the swearing such as Arab orator, proficient  though he may have been in the art, had never made, the dogmatic certainty  with which the Prophet proclaimed his message have tended, equally with the  passionate grandeur of his utterances, to hold the Muslim world spell-bound  to the letter and imbued with all the narrowness of the book.    So sacred is the text supposed to be that only the {7} Companions[8] of the  Prophet are deemed worthy of being commentators on it. The work of learned  divines since then has been to learn the Quran by heart and to master the  traditions, with the writings of the earliest commentators thereon. The  revelation itself is never made a subject of investigation or tried by the  ordinary rules of criticism. If only the Isnad, or chain of authorities for  any interpretation, is good, that interpretation is unhesitatingly accepted  as the correct one. It is a fundamental article of belief that no other  book in the world can possibly approach near to it in thought or  expression. It deals with positive precepts rather than with principles.  Its decrees are held to be binding not in the spirit merely but in the very  letter on all men, at all times and under every circumstance of life. This  follows as a natural consequence from the belief in its eternal nature.    The various portions recited by the Prophet during the twenty-three years  of his prophetical career were committed to writing by some of his  followers, or treasured up in their memories. As the recital of the Quran  formed a part of every act of public worship, and as such recital was an  act of great religious merit, every Muslim tried to remember as much as he  could. He who could do so best was entitled to the highest honour, and was  often the recipient of a substantial reward.[9] The Arab love for poetry  facilitated the exercise of this faculty. When the Prophet died the  revelation ceased. There was no distinct copy of the whole, nothing to show  what was of transitory importance, what of permanent value. There is  nothing which proves that the Prophet took any special care of any  portions. There seems to have been no definite order in which, when the  book was {8} compiled, the various Suras were arranged, for the Quran, as  it now exists, is utterly devoid of all historical or logical sequence. For  a year after the Prophet's death nothing seems to have been done; but then  the battle of Yemana took place in which a very large number of the best  Quran reciters were slain. Omar took fright at this, and addressing the  Khalif Abu Bakr, said, \"The slaughter may again wax hot amongst the  repeaters of the Quran in other fields of battle, and much may be lost  therefrom. Now, therefore, my advice is that thou shouldest give speedy  orders for the collection of the Quran.\" Abu Bakr agreed, and said to Zeid  who had been an amanuensis of the Prophet:--\"Thou art a young man, and  wise, against whom no one amongst us can cast an imputation; and thou wert  wont to write down the inspired revelations of the Prophet of the Lord,  wherefore now search out the Quran and bring it all together.\" Zeid being  at length pressed to undertake the task proceeded to gather the Quran  together from \"date leaves, and tablets of white stone, and from the hearts  of men.\" In course of time it was all compiled in the order in which the  book is now arranged. This was the authorized text for some twenty-three  years after the death of Muhammad. Owing, however, either to different  modes of recitation, or to differences of expression in the sources from  which Zeid's first recension was made, a variety of different readings  crept into the copies in use. The Faithful became alarmed and the Khalif  Osman was persuaded to put a stop to such a danger. He appointed Zeid with  three of the leading men of the Quraish as assistants to go over the whole  work again. A careful recension was made of the whole book which was then  assimilated to the Meccan dialect, the purest in Arabia. After this all  other copies of the Quran were burnt by order of the Khalif, and new  transcripts were made of the revised edition which was now the only  authorised copy. As it is a fundamental tenet of Islam that the Quran is  incorruptible and absolutely free {9} from error, no little difficulty has  been felt in explaining the need of Osman's new and revised edition and of  the circumstances under which it took place; but as usual a Tradition has  been handed down which makes it lawful to read the Quran in seven dialects.  The book in its present form may be accepted as a genuine reproduction of  Abu Bakr's edition with authoritative corrections. We may rest assured that  we have in the Quran now in use the record of what Muhammad said. It thus  becomes a fundamental basis of Islam. It was a common practice of the early  Muslims when speaking of the Prophet to say:--\"His character is the Quran.\"  When people curious to know details of the life of their beloved master  asked 'Ayesha, one of his widows, about him, she used to reply:--\"Thou hast  the Quran, art thou not an Arab and readest the Arab tongue? Why dost thou  ask me, for the Prophet's disposition is no other than the Quran?\"    Whether Muhammad would have arranged the Quran as we now have it is a  subject on which it is impossible to form an opinion. There are Traditions  which seem to show that he had some doubts as to its completeness. I give  the following account on the authority of M. Caussin de Percival. When  Muhammad felt his end draw near he said:--\"Bring ink and paper: I wish to  write to you a book to preserve you always from error.\" But it was too  late. He could not write or dictate and so he said:--\"May the Quran always  be your guide. Perform what it commands you: avoid what it prohibits.\" The  genuineness of the first part of this Tradition is, I think, very doubtful,  the latter is quite in accordance with the Prophet's claim for his  teaching. The letter of the book became, as Muhammad intended it should  become, a despotic influence in the Muslim world, a barrier to freethinking  on the part of all the orthodox, an obstacle to innovation in all  spheres--political, social, intellectual and moral. There are many topics  connected with it which can be better explained in the next chapter. All  {10} that has now to be here stated is that the Quran is the first  foundation of Islam. It is an error to suppose it is the only one: an error  which more than anything else has led persons away from the only position  in which they could obtain a true idea of the great system of Islam.    The Shia'hs maintain, without good reason, that the following verses  favourable to the claims of 'Ali and of the Shia'h faction were omitted in  Osman's recension.        \"O Believers! believe in the two lights. (Muhammad and 'Ali).        'Ali is of the number of the pious, we shall give him his right in the      day of judgment; we shall not pass over those who wish to deceive him.      We have honoured him above all this family. He and his family are very      patient. Their enemy[10] is the chief of sinners.        We have announced to thee a race of just men, men[11] who will not      oppose our orders. My mercy and peace are on them living[12] or dead.        As to those who walk in their way, my mercy is on them; they will      certainly gain the mansions of Paradise.\"    2. THE SUNNAT.--The second foundation of Islam is based on the Hadis  (plural Ahadis) or Tradition. Commands from God given in the Quran are  called 'farz' and 'wajib.' A command given by the Prophet or an example set  by him is called 'sunnat,' a word meaning a rule. It is then technically  applied to the basis of religious faith and practice, which is founded on  traditional accounts of the sayings and acts of Muhammad.[13] It is the  belief common to all Musalmans, that the Prophet in all that he _did_, and  in all that he _said_, was supernaturally guided, and that his words and  acts are to all time and to all his followers a divine rule of faith and  practice. \"We should know that God Almighty has given commands and  prohibitions to his {11} servants, either by means of the Quran, or by the  mouth of His Prophet.\"[14] Al-Ghazali, a most distinguished theologian,  writes:--\"Neither is the faith according to His will, complete by the  testimony to the Unity alone, that is, by simply saying, 'There is but one  God,' without the addition of the further testimony to the Apostle, that  is, the statement, 'Muhammad is the apostle of God.'\" This belief in the  Prophet must extend to all that he has said concerning the present and the  future life, for,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20663"],[0,"The American Practical Brewer and Tanner (#3)"],[1,"house; the second, or corresponding gateway, to pass through the  opposite side of the square, into an outer yard, well enclosed with  walls and sheds, containing cooper's shop, &c. where all the empty  casks might be securely preserved from the injury of wind and weather.  This yard should be further sufficiently large to afford room for a hay  reek, firewood, dung, &c. The brewery office should be placed in the  passage of the outer gateway, so that every thing going in and out  might be seen by those who are in the office. The dwelling house, vat  house, and working store, to form one side of the brewery. The malt  house, another. The kiln house, dropping room, and stable, a third  side. The brewery, mill house, and hop room, to form the fourth side;  thus completed, it would form a square, and afford security to whatever  was contained within it, when the gates are locked. The sky cooler is,  generally, the most elevated vessel in the brewery, and when properly  constructed, is of great importance in facilitating both brewing and  malting operations, as it usually supplies the whole quantity of water  wanted in both. It commands the copper, and, of course, all the other  vessels of the brewery: it may be so constructed as to form a complete  roof to the mill loft, and in that situation be most conveniently  placed for being filled from the water cistern, which should be placed  contiguous to the mill walk, and so raised to the sky cooler by one or  more pumps worked by the mill, with a one, two, or three horse power,  according to the length of the lever, and the diameter of the mill.  Sky, or water coolers, in general, are square vessels, made of the best  two inch pine plank, properly jointed, from twenty to twenty-five feet  square, laid on strong joists sufficiently close, and trunneled down  (after pressing) with wooden trunnels from end to end, to prevent  starting or warping; the joists are supported by a couple of strong  beams, equally spaced; the sides of these coolers are generally raised  from eighteen inches to two feet; in Europe they are generally leaded  on their inside, but this expense may be saved, if they are properly  made at first, and afterwards kept constantly full of water. In  constructing these coolers, all the joints should be paid with white  paint before laying, and the sides bolted, and screwed down; the better  and easier to effect which, the thickness of the sides may be three  inches after the saw; there should be a roofing all round the sides, to  protect them from the weather; the bottom of the sky cooler should  command the copper back, which should be made to form the cover of the  copper, and to hold a complete charge of the same. These vessels, when  properly constructed, are extremely useful in preventing waste and  accidents by boiling over, also affording to the brewer, the  opportunity of boiling his wort as fiercely as he pleases--a very  important advantage in brewing porter and strong beer. A description of  this back is not necessary, as every set cooper, who knows his  business, is well acquainted with the proper construction of this  vessel. The stuff it is made of should be two inches thick, well  seasoned, and of the best pine plank. Thus placed on the copper, it  should form a complete cover, water and steam tight, so that when the  copper boils over, it will run into the back, and return again by a  plug hole into the copper. The copper cock should be sufficiently  elevated to command the hop cooler; the latter the wort coolers, No. 1  and 2. By thus running the worts from one cooler to another, you afford  them the opportunity of depositing in each their feculencies, and  coming nearly fine to the fermenting tuns, which should be sufficiently  elevated above the troughs and casks to be filled, so that the  operation of cleansing may be easily performed by one or more leaders,  to communicate with a two or three piped tun dish, capable of filling  two or three casks at a time. The mill stones, or metal rollers, should  be sufficiently elevated to grind into the malt bin, placed over the  mash tun, which bin should be sufficiently capacious to hold the whole  grist of malt when ground; this bin is generally constructed in the  form of a hopper, with a slide at the bottom, to let the malt into the  mash tun when the water is ready, by being cooled down to its proper  temperature. I would recommend making the mash tun shallow, so that the  diameter shall be three times as long as the staff of the sides, above  the false bottom. To the mash tun there should be a cover, in two or  more pieces, according to size. The receiver, or underbank, which is  placed under the mash tun, should be sufficiently elevated above  ground, so as to enable the dirty or washing water to run off from its  bottom by a plug hole. The fermenting tuns should be placed in a room  where there is a fireplace, so as to raise the temperature in cold  weather; each tun should be cribbed on its sides, with a stationary  cover on the top. The cribs should be made to answer the sweep of the  vessel, and to be put on or off as occasion, or the temperature of the  season, may require. In one corner of the working store, I would  recommend to have placed a set of drains, two in number, one over the  other; the lower drain should be sufficiently elevated to get a bucket  under it, so as to draw off its contents by a plug hole, placed at one  corner of each drain. These drains will soon pay for themselves, by the  quantity of yest that will be deposited on them, at each time of  drawing them off, while the liquor will get fine, and may be applied in  a variety of ways, to answer the purposes of the brewer, what in  filling, starting in the tun, vatting, &c.          _Malt House, the best construction of, with proper Barley Lofts,  Dropping Room, and Flooring, how, and in what manner made, and best  likely to last._      Malt houses intended to be annexed to breweries, should not be on a  less scale than sixty feet long, by twenty-five feet wide. Unless there  be a proper proportion of flooring to work the grain kindly and  moderately, good malt is not to be expected. Two-floored houses are  generally preferred to any other construction; would recommend placing  the steep outside the house, to be communicated with from the lower  floor by means of an arch way or window; the steep so placed should be  covered with a tight roof; the best materials for making a steep are  good brick, well grouted; the wall should be fourteen inches thick at  least; this kind of steep will be found far superior to wood, as not  liable to leak, or be worked on by rats; the sides and ends of this  steep should be carefully plastered with tarrass mortar; the bottom may  be laid with flag, tiles, or brick.[2] Two barley lofts, the whole  length of the malt house, will be found highly convenient, as affording  sufficient room to different large parcels of barley, and screening the  same from loft to loft as it descends into the steep over wire screens;  a contrivance I have found of great advantage in the malting operation,  as finishing the cleaning of the barley before getting into the steep,  a precaution that should never be omitted. The bottom of the screen  should be cased with wood, communicating from loft to loft with a sack  fastened to hooks at the lower end to receive all the dirt and  screenings that may pass through the screens. The Dutch and German  maltsters generally prefer having their lower or working floor under  ground; but this I take to be a bad plan, unless in elevated  situations, or where the soil is dry and gravelly; for if any spring of  water or damp arises in the malt-house floor, or walls so placed, the  injury to the malt is very great, and should be carefully guarded  against. It is also very important to lay a solid foundation for your  lower floor with stones, brick bats, or coarse gravel, which should be  solidly compacted by ramming for the whole length, then levelled off by  stakes, with a ten-foot level, to the thickness you would wish to give  your floor--say three or four inches: the former thickness, say three  inches, will be found sufficient. Lay your first coat on two inches  thick with hair mortar; when this coat becomes sufficiently stiff,  which will happen within twenty-four hours, you are to begin to lay  your second or last coat of one inch thick over the first, to be  prepared as follows: Take Roche, or unslaked lime, one part, by  measure; fine pit sand, one part; clinker, or forge dust, finely  powdered, two parts; clay or lome, by measure also, one part: let these  different ingredients (taking the precaution of first slaking the Roche  lime) be well mixed together, and then screened by a wire screen,  carefully keeping out of the mixture all lumps and stones; the whole  may be then worked up with a due proportion of water, observing that  this kind of mortar cannot be too much worked or mixed together, nor  too little wetted, just sufficient to work freely with the plastering  trowel; the whole floor should, if possible, be laid in one day, and  for this purpose several hands should be employed; in which case it  will dry more equally and firmly. As soon as the floor begins to set,  and that it will bear a board on it, without sinking in, you should  begin to pound it in all directions, from end to end, with pounders  made of two-inch plank, sixteen inches long, and from nine to twelve  inches wide, with a long handle reaching breast high, and to be placed  in the middle of this board; thus the operation of pounding will  proceed without stooping or much labour. One or two men, with  plastering trowels, should follow the pounders, wetting it with skimmed  milk as they go, and set the floor as even and close as possible. If  these two operations be well conducted there will not be found a single  crack in the whole floor from end to end, which is of great"]]]
