At the time of her  birth, it existed in two branches, of which, the one ruled over what  was called the Duchy of Brunswick, the other over the Electorate  (since 1815 the Kingdom) of Hanover, and had since 1714 occupied the  throne of England. There had been frequent intermarriages between the  two branches. The Dukes of Brunswick were now, however, represented  only by two young princes, who were the sons of the celebrated Duke  who fell at Quatre-Bras. Between them and the English Court there was  little intercourse. The elder, Charles, had quarrelled with his uncle  and guardian, George IV., and had in 1830 been expelled from his  dominions. The obvious faults of his character made it impossible for  the other German princes to insist on his being restored, and he had  been succeeded by his younger brother William, who ruled till his  death in 1884. Both died unmarried, and with them the Ducal family  came to an end. One Princess of Brunswick had been the wife of George  IV., and another, Augusta, was the first wife of Frederick I., King  of Wuertemberg, who, after her death, married a daughter of George III.  The King of Wuertemberg was also, by his descent from Frederick Prince  of Wales, first cousin once removed of the Queen. We need only notice,  in passing, the distant connection with the royal families of Prussia,  the Netherlands, and Denmark. The Prince of Orange, who was one of the  possible suitors for the young Queen's hand, was her third cousin once  removed.      [Pageheading: THE HOUSE OF SAXE-COBURG-GOTHA]    The House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, to which the Queen belonged on her  mother's side, and with which she was to be even more intimately  connected by her marriage, was one of the numerous branches into which  the ancient and celebrated House of Wettin had broken up. Since the  11th century they had ruled over Meissen and the adjoining districts.  To these had been added Upper Saxony and Thuringia. In the 15th  century the whole possessions of the House had been divided between  the two great branches which still exist. The Albertine branch  retained Meissen and the Saxon possessions. They held the title of  Elector, which in 1806 was exchanged for the title of King. Though  the Saxon House had been the chief protectors of the Reformation,  Frederick Augustus I. had, on being elected to the throne of Poland,  become a Roman Catholic; and thereby the connection between the two  branches of the House had to a great extent ceased. The second line,  that of the Ernestines, ruled over Thuringia, but, according to the  common German custom, had again broken up into numerous branches,  among which the Duchies of Thuringia were parcelled out. At the time  of the Queen's birth there were five of these, viz., Gotha-Altenburg,  Coburg-Saalfeld, Weimar-Eisenach, Meiningen, and Hildburghausen. On  the extinction of the Gotha line, in 1825, there was a rearrangement  of the family property, by which the Duke of Hildburghausen received  Altenburg, Gotha was given to the Duke of Coburg, and Saalfeld with  Hildburghausen added to Meiningen. These four lines still exist.    The Ernestine princes had, by this constant division and sub-division,  deprived themselves of the opportunity of exercising any predominant  influence, or pursuing any independent policy in German affairs; and  though they had the good fortune to emerge from the revolution with  their possessions unimpaired, their real power was not increased. Like  all the other princes, they had, however, at the Congress of Vienna,  received the recognition of their full status as sovereign princes of  the Germanic Confederation. Together they sent a single representative  to the Diet of Frankfort, the total population of the five  principalities being only about 300,000 inhabitants.    It was owing to this territorial sub-division and lack of cohesion  that these princes could not attach to their independence the  same political importance that fell to the share of the larger  principalities, such as Hanover and Bavaria, and they were  consequently more ready than the other German princes to welcome  proposals which would lead to a unification of Germany.    It is notable that the line has produced many of the most enlightened  of the German princes; and nowhere in the whole of Germany were the  advantages of the division into numerous small States so clearly seen,  and the disadvantages so little felt, as at Weimar, Meiningen, Gotha,  and Coburg.      [Pageheading: THE HOUSE OF COBURG]    The House of Coburg had gained a highly conspicuous and influential  position, owing, partly, to the high reputation for sagacity and  character which the princes of that House had won, and partly to  the marriage connections which were entered into about this time by  members of the Coburg House with the leading Royal families of Europe.  Within ten years, Princes of Coburg were established, one upon the  throne of Belgium, and two others next to the throne in Portugal and  England, as Consorts of their respective Queens.    By the first marriage of the Duchess of Kent, the Queen was also  connected with a third class of German princes--the Mediatised, as  those were called who during the revolution had lost their sovereign  power. Many of these were of as ancient lineage and had possessed as  large estates as some of the regnant princes, who, though not always  more deserving, had been fortunate enough to retain their privileges,  and had emerged from the revolution ranking among the ruling Houses of  Europe. The mediatised princes, though they had ceased to rule, still  held important privileges, which were guaranteed at the Congress  of Vienna. First, and most important, they were reckoned as  \"_ebenburtig_,\" which means that they could contract equal marriages  with the Royal Houses, and these marriages were recognised as valid  for the transmission of rights of inheritance. Many of them had vast  private estates, and though they were subjected to the sovereignty of  the princes in whose dominions these lay, they enjoyed very important  privileges, such as exemption from military service, and from  many forms of taxation; they also could exercise minor forms of  jurisdiction. They formed, therefore, an intermediate class. Since  Germany, as a whole, afforded them no proper sphere of political  activity, the more ambitious did not disdain to take service with  Austria or Prussia, and, to a less extent, even with the smaller  States. It was possible, therefore, for the Queen's mother, a Princess  of Saxe-Coburg, to marry the Prince of Leiningen without losing caste.  Her daughter, the Princess Feodore, the Queen's half-sister, married  Ernest, Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, and thus established an  interesting connection with perhaps the most widely-spread and most  distinguished of all these families. The House of Hohenlohe would  probably still have been a reigning family, had not the Prince of  Hohenlohe preferred to fight in the Prussian army against Napoleon,  rather than receive gifts from him. His lands were consequently  confiscated and passed to other princes who were less scrupulous.  The family has given two Ministers President to Prussia, a General in  chief command of the Prussian army, a Chancellor to the German Empire,  and one of the most distinguished of modern military writers. They  held, besides their extensive possessions in Wuertemberg and Bavaria,  the County of Gleichen in Saxe-Coburg.

But there's no great harm  in them, miss. They are just larks, nothing worse.\"    \"You don't do really bad things?\" the girl asked.    \"No, miss, I hope not.\"    \"And you don't tell stories, do you?\"    \"No, miss, never. If I do anything and I am asked, I always own it.  I wouldn't tell a lie to save myself from a licking.\"    \"That's right,\" the girl said graciously.    She caught somewhat of her mother's manner, from going about with  her to the cottages; and it seemed quite natural, to her, to give  her advice to this village scapegrace.    \"Well, try not to do these sort of things again, Reuben; because I  like you, and I don't like to hear people say you are the worst boy  in the village, and I don't think you are. Good-bye,\" and Kate  Ellison proceeded on her way.    Reuben smiled as he looked after her. Owing to his memory of his  former position at the mill, and to his mother's talk and teaching,  Reuben did not entertain the same feeling of respect, mingled with  fear, for the squire's family which was felt by the village in  general. Instead of being two years younger than himself, the girl  had spoken as gravely as if she had been twenty years his senior,  and Reuben could not help a smile of amusement.    \"She is a dear little lady,\" he said, as he looked after her; \"and  it's only natural she should talk like her mother. But Mrs. Ellison  means well, too, mother says; and as for the squire, he is a good  fellow. I expected he would have given it to me the other day.    \"Well, now I will go up to the pony. One more lesson, and I think a  baby might ride it.\"    As he walked along, he met Tom Thorne. There had been war between  them, since the affair of the broken window. Reuben had shown the  other no animosity on the subject as, having been cleared, he had  felt in no way aggrieved; but Tom Thorne was very sore over it. In  the first place, he had been found out; and although Reuben himself  had said nothing to him, respecting his conduct in allowing him to  be flogged for the offence which he himself had committed, others  had not been so reticent, and he had had a hard time of it in the  village. Secondly, he had been severely thrashed by his father, in  the presence of the squire; the former laying on the lash with a  vigour which satisfied Mr. Ellison, the heartiness of the thrashing  being due, not to any indignation at the fault, but because the  boy's conduct had excited the squire's anger; which Thorne, for  many reasons, was anxious to deprecate. He was his landlord, and  had the power to turn him out at a quarter's notice; and as there  was no possibility of obtaining any other house near, and he was  doing by no means a bad trade, he was anxious to keep on good terms  with him.    Tom Thorne was sitting on a gate, as Reuben passed.    \"You think you be a fine fellow, Reuben, but I will be even with  you, some day.\"    \"You can be even with me now,\" Reuben said, \"if you like to get off  that gate.\"    \"I bain't afeared of you, Reuben, don't you go to think it; only I  ain't going to do any fighting now. Feyther says if I get into any  more rows, he will pay me out; so I can't lick you now, but some  day I will be even with you.\"    \"That's a good excuse,\" Reuben said scornfully. \"However, I don't  want to fight if you don't, only you keep your tongue to yourself.  I don't want to say nothing to you, if you don't say nothing to me.  You played me a dirty trick the other day, and you got well  larrupped for it, so I don't owe you any grudge; but mind you, I  don't want any more talk about your getting even with me, for if  you do give me any more of it I will fetch you one on the nose, and  then you will have a chance of getting even, at once.\"    Tom Thorne held his tongue, only relieving his feelings by making a  grimace after Reuben, as the latter passed on. In the various  contests among the boys of the village, Reuben had proved himself  so tough an adversary that, although Tom Thorne was heavier and  bigger, he did not care about entering upon what would be, at best,  a doubtful contest with him.    Contenting himself, therefore, with another muttered, \"I will be  even with you some day,\" he strolled home to his father's ale  house.    The change at the school was very speedily made. The squire  generally carried out his resolutions while they were hot and, on  the very day after his conversation with his wife on the subject,  he went first to the vicar and arranged for the retirement of the  clerk, and the instalment of White in his place; and then went to  the school house, and informed the master of his intention. The  latter had been expecting his dismissal, since Mrs. Ellison had  spoken to him on the previous day; and the news which the squire  gave him was a relief to him. His emoluments, as clerk, would be  smaller than those he received as schoolmaster; but while he would  not be able to discharge the duties of the latter for very much  longer, for he felt the boys were getting too much for him, he  would be able to perform the very easy work entailed by the  clerkship for many years to come. It was, too, a position not  without dignity; and indeed, in the eyes of the village the clerk  was a personage of far greater importance than the schoolmaster. He  therefore thankfully accepted the offer, and agreed to give up the  school as soon as a substitute could be found.    In those days anyone was considered good enough for a village  schoolmaster, and the post was generally filled by men who had  failed as tradesmen, and in everything else they put their hands  to; and whose sole qualification for the office was that they were  able to read and write. Instead of advertising, however, in the  county paper, the squire wrote to an old college friend, who was  now in charge of a London parish, and asked him to choose a man for  the post.    \"I don't want a chap who will cram all sorts of new notions into  the heads of the children,\" the squire said. \"I don't think it  would do them any good, or fit them any better for their stations.  The boys have got to be farm labourers, and the girls to be their  wives; and if they can read really well, and write fairly, it's  about as much as they want in the way of learning; but I think that  a really earnest sort of man might do them good, otherwise. A  schoolmaster, in my mind, should be the clergyman's best assistant.  I don't know, my dear fellow, that I can explain in words more  exactly what I mean; but I think you will understand me, and will  send down the sort of man I want.    \"The cottage is a comfortable one, there's a good bit of garden  attached to it, and I don't mind paying a few shillings a week more  than I do now, to get the sort of man I want. If he has a wife so  much the better. She might teach the girls to sew, which would be,  to nine out of ten, a deal more use than reading and writing; and  if she could use her needle, and make up dresses and that sort of  thing, she might add to their income. Not one woman in five in the  village can make her own clothes, and they have to go to a place  three miles away to get them done.\"    A week later the squire received an answer from his friend, saying  that he had chosen a man, and his wife, whom he thought would suit.    \"The poor fellow was rather a cripple,\" he said. \"He is a wood  engraver by trade, but he fell downstairs and hurt his back. The  doctor who attended him at the hospital spoke to me about him. He  said that he might, under favourable circumstances, get better in  time; but that he was delicate, and absolutely needed change of air  and a country life. I have seen him several times, and have been  much struck with his intelligence. He has been much depressed at  being forbidden to work, but has cheered up greatly since I told  him of your offer. I have no doubt he will do well.    \"I have selected him, not only for that reason, but because his  wife is as suitable as he is. She is an admirable young woman, and  was a dressmaker before he married her. She has supported them both  ever since he was hurt, months ago. She is delighted at the idea of  the change for, although the money will be very much less than he  earned at his trade, she has always been afraid of his health  giving way; and is convinced that fresh air, and the garden you  speak of, will put new life into him.\"    The squire was not quite satisfied with the letter; but, as he told  himself, he could not expect to get a man trained specially as a  schoolmaster to accept the post; and at any rate, if the man was  not satisfactory his wife was likely to be so. He accordingly  ordered his groom to take the light cart and drive over to Lewes,  the next day, to meet the coach when it came in; and to bring over  the new schoolmaster, his wife, and their belongings.    Mrs. Ellison at once went down to the village, and got a woman to  scrub the cottage from top to bottom, and put everything tidy. The  furniture went with the house, and had been provided by the squire.  Mrs. Ellison went over it, and ordered a few more things to be sent  down from the house to make it more comfortable for a married  couple and, driving over to Lewes, ordered a carpet, curtains, and  a few other little comforts for it.    James Shrewsbury was, upon his arrival, much pleased with his  cottage, which contrasted strongly with the room in a crowded  street which he had occupied in London; and his wife was still more  pleased.    \"I am sure we shall be happy and comfortable here, James,\" she  said, \"and the air feels so fresh and pure that I am convinced you  will soon get strong and well again. What is money to health? I am  sure I shall be ten times as happy, here, as I was when you were  earning three or four times as much, in London.\"    The squire and Mrs. Ellison came down the next morning, at the  opening of the school; and after a chat with the new schoolmaster  and his wife, the"]]]
