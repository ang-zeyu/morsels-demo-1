[Illustration: TYPICAL OF THOSE USED BY GERMAN AIR-CRAFT DURING THE WAR:  A BOMB RECENTLY DROPPED FROM AN AEROPLANE INTO WARSAW.    German air-craft have  lately been active in the  neighbourhood of Warsaw,  the great objective  of the German Eastern Armies. Our  photograph shows a  bomb after it had fallen into the city.    _Photograph by Illus. Bureau._]    According to all accounts, the Allied position in the west, especially the  British section thereof, is  as \"safe as the Bank of  England,\" to use the  words  of one  of  our officers  already quoted;  and  though the  Kaiser,  recovered from his illness, has again returned to the front--or, at least.  the distant rear of the front--he does not seem to have much refreshed the  offensive  spirit of  his armies.  Nevertheless, the  French _communiques_  have suffered  from no great diminution  in the daily records  of sporadic  trench-fighting all along  the Allied line--fighting of  a fluctuating, if  on the whole  favourable, kind for the strategic plans  of General Joffre,  as to whom, one  German officer in Belgium said that he  wished to God his  country had such  a War Lord, seeing that, apart  from Marshal Hindenburg,  all their Generals were only worthy of disdain.    In  a telegram  to his  aunt,  the Dowager  Grand Duchess  of Baden,  only  daughter of the old Emperor William, the Kaiser gave \"God alone the glory\"  for a grand victory which was supposed to have been achieved by Hindenburg  over the  Russians in front  of Warsaw--a  victory which caused  Berlin to  burst out into bunting and braying  and comparisons to Salamis and Leipzig  in its  momentous results. But  this acknowledgment  of the Kaiser  to the  Lord  of  Hosts,  \"our  old  ally of  Rossbach\"--which  must  surely  have  inspired  Hindenburg himself  with  a  feeling of  jealousy  and sense  of  soreness--turned out to have been  altogether premature, and of the nature  of shouting before they were out of the wood.    For a  fortnight or so the  fighting in Poland  continued to be of  a very  confused kind, the telegrams from both sides being most contradictory, but  on  the whole  the  advantage  seemed to  remain  with  the Russians,  who  recorded their victories  in very striking figures of  killed and captured  during their  defence of several  rivers tributary  to the Vistula  on its  left bank. Hindenburg the redoubtable--the only  General worth a rap (or a  \"damn,\" as  Wellington would have  said), according to the  German officer  already  quoted--promised to  let the  Kaiser have  Warsaw as  a Christmas  present; but,  according to all present  appearances, he is no  nearer the  capital of Russian Poland  than his comrade von Kluck (who  is now said to  have been superseded)  was to Paris on  the day of his  being tumbled back  from the Marne.    <sc>London: December 28, 1914.</sc>    [Illustration: A PRINCELY INDIAN GIFT: MOTOR-AMBULANCES PRESENTED TO THE  KING FOR THE FORCES BY THE MAHARAJA SCINDIA OF GWALIOR.

Fate made  the Chateau,  with the  small adjoining  village, for upwards  of eight weeks a  disputed tactical  point between the Germans and the Allies, a narrow strip of only 150 yards  of ground  intervening between  the trenches.  The Germans  held Vermelles  from  October 16  until  early  in December,  fortifying  the Chateau  and  grounds. They had  to be shelled out  By October 21, the  Chateau was only  smouldering walls, and French engineers were mining approaches to it. Then  an English  heavy battery  bombarded Vermelles. Finally  the French  \"in a  very brilliant attack,\" stormed and took Vermelles, village and chateau.          __________________________________________________________________________  10--THE ILLUSTRATED WAR NEWS, DEC. 30, 1914.--[Part 21]      [Illustration: RULER OF EGYPT, THE BRITISH PROTECTORATE: SULTAN HUSSEIN I.]    The new Sultan of  Egypt, Prince Hussein Kamel, is sixty  years of age and  the  eldest living  Prince  of the  family of  Mehemet  Ali, the  historic  liberator of  Egypt from Turkish  domination.

LA CIGALO E LA FOURNIGO.                       I.      Jour de Dieu, queto caud! Beu tems per la Cigalo,      Que, trefoulido, se regalo    D'uno raisso de fio; beu tems per la meissoun.

III.           Vaqui l'istori veritablo         Ben liuen dou conte de la fablo.         Que n'en pensas, caneu de sort!         --O rammaissaire de dardeno         Det croucu, boumbudo bedeno    Que gouvernas lou mounde eme lou coffre-fort,           Fases courre lou bru, canaio,         Que l'artisto jamai travaio         E deu pati, lou bedigas.         Teisas-vous dounc: quand di lambrusco         La Cigalo a cava la rusco,    Raubas soun beure, e piei, morto, la rousigas.    So speaks my friend in the expressive Provencal idiom, rehabilitating  the creature so libelled by the fabulist.    Translated with a little necessary freedom, the English of it is as  follows:--                      I.      Fine weather for the Cigale! God, what heat!       Half drunken with her joy, she feasts    In a hail of fire. Pays for the harvest meet;       A golden sea the reaper breasts,    Loins bent, throat bare; silent, he labours long,    For thirst within his throat has stilled the song.      A blessed time for thee, little Cigale.       Thy little cymbals shake and sound,    Shake, shake thy stomach till thy mirrors fall!       Man meanwhile swings his scythe around;    Continually back and forth it veers,    Flashing its steel amidst the ruddy ears.      Grass-plugged, with water for the grinder full,      A flask is hung upon his hip;    The stone within its wooden trough is cool,      Free all the day to sip and sip;    But man is gasping in the fiery sun,    That makes his very marrow melt and run.      Thou, Cigale, hast a cure for thirst: the bark,      Tender and juicy, of the bough.    Thy beak, a very needle, stabs it. Mark      The narrow passage welling now;    The sugared stream is flowing, thee beside,    Who drinkest of the flood, the honeyed tide.      Not in peace always; nay, for thieves arrive,      Neighbours and wives, or wanderers vile;    They saw thee sink the well, and ill they thrive      Thirsting; they seek to drink awhile;    Beauty, beware! the wallet-snatcher's face,    Humble at first, grows insolent apace.      They seek the merest drop; thy leavings take;      Soon discontent, their heads they toss;    They crave for all, and all will have. They rake      Their claws thy folded wings across;    Thy back a mountain, up and down each goes;    They seize thee by the beak, the horns, the toes.      This way and that they pull. Impatient thou:      Pst! Pst! a jet of nauseous taste    O'er the assembly sprinklest. Leave the bough      And fly the rascals thus disgraced,    Who stole thy well, and with malicious pleasure    Now lick their honey'd lips, and feed at leisure.      See these Bohemians without labour fed!      The ant the worst of all the crew--    Fly, drone, wasp, beetle too with horned head,      All of them sharpers thro' and thro',    Idlers the sun drew to thy well apace--    None more than she was eager for thy place,      More apt thy face to tickle, toe to tread,      Or nose to pinch, and then to run    Under the shade thine ample belly spread;      Or climb thy leg for ladder; sun    Herself audacious on thy wings, and go    Most insolently o'er thee to and fro.                        II.      Now comes a tale that no one should believe.      In other times, the ancients say,    The winter came, and hunger made thee grieve.      Thou didst in secret see one day    The ant below the ground her treasure store away.      The wealthy ant was drying in the sun      Her corn the dew had wet by night,    Ere storing it again; and one by one      She filled her sacks as it dried aright.    Thou camest then, and tears bedimmed thy sight,      Saying: \"'Tis very cold; the bitter bise      Blows me this way and that to-day.    I die of hunger. Of your riches please      Fill me my bag, and I'll repay,    When summer and its melons come this way.      \"Lend me a little corn.\" Go to, go to!      Think you the ant will lend an ear?    You are deceived. Great sacks, but nought for you!      \"Be off, and scrape some barrel clear!    You sing of summer: starve, for winter's here!\"      'Tis thus the ancient fable sings      To teach us all the prudence ripe    Of farthing-snatchers, glad to knot the string      That tie their purses. May the gripe    Of colic twist the guts of all such tripe!      He angers me, this fable-teller does,      Saying in winter thou dost seek    Flies, grubs, corn--thou dost never eat like us!      --Corn! Couldst thou eat it, with thy beak?    Thou hast thy fountain with its honey'd reek.      To thee what matters winter? Underground      Slumber thy children, sheltered; thou    The sleep that knows no waking sleepest sound.      Thy body, fallen from the bough,    Crumbles; the questing ant has found thee now.      The wicked ant of thy poor withered hide      A banquet makes; in little bits    She cuts thee up, and empties thine inside,      And stores thee where in wealth she sits:    Choice diet when the winter numbs the wits.                       III.      Here is the tale related duly,    And little resembling the fable, truly!    Hoarders of farthings, I know, deuce take it.    It isn't the story as you would make it!    Crook-fingers, big-bellies, what do you say,    Who govern the world with the cash-box--hey?      You have spread the story, with shrug and smirk,    That the artist ne'er does a stroke of work;"]]]
