It is a moot point whether the town was ever a settlement  of the Romans, no traces of such occupation having ever been discovered.  The castle mound, no doubt, formed some part of the earthworks of an  earlier stronghold. The word Norwich is probably of Norse origin,  meaning the north village or the village on the North Creek  (\"_wic_\"--_i.e._ a creek). The city stood on a tidal bay in 1004, in  which year the Danes under Sweyn completely devastated and ruined the  town in revenge for the massacre of their countrymen by Aethelred the  Unready two years before. So that the history of the town of Norwich, as  we now know it, may be said to have started directly after this.    The foundation-stone of the cathedral was laid in 1096; and upon it,  according to the _Registrum Primum_, the following inscription is said  to have been placed:--\"In nomine patris et filii et spiritus Sancti Amen  Ego Herbertus Episcopus apposui istum lapidem.\" (In the Name of the  Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, Amen, I, Herbert the  Bishop, have placed this stone.)    It was the custom of the Norman builders to start building from the  easternmost part of the church, as the more sacred part of the  structure, and then build westwards; so that probably this  foundation-stone, for which diligent search has been made in vain, was  in the eastmost wall of the original Norman Lady Chapel--in fact, the  _Registrum Primum_ describes how Herbert began the work \"where is now  the chapel of the Blessed Mary.\" This chapel was demolished to make way  for the beautiful thirteenth-century Lady Chapel which Dean Gardiner  destroyed.    The thirteenth-century builders of the Lady Chapel may have used  Herbert's foundation-stone in their walling; Dean Lefroy quite lately,  while repairing parts of the tower and east end, came across pieces of  stone with beautiful \"dog-tooth\" ornament upon them, which had been used  to repair the masonry that, it was evident, at one time had formed part  of the thirteenth-century Lady Chapel. This must be so, since in no  other part of the building save the arches now remaining in the extreme  eastern wall of the procession path, which at one time gave access to  the Lady Chapel, does such ornament occur.    It is probable, and the more generally accredited supposition, that  Herbert built the presbytery with its encircling procession path and the  original trefoil of Norman chapel radiating therefrom;--the choir and  transepts with the two chapels projecting eastwards and the first two  bays of the nave. Harrod advances a theory that he completely finished  the whole of the cathedral church, as well as the offices for the  housing of the sixty monks who were placed therein, in 1101.    He also built the episcopal palace on the north side of the cathedral,  of which some parts remain to this day incorporated with work of a later  period; he seems to have founded and built other churches in Norwich and  Yarmouth. He died on the 22nd of July 1119, in the twenty-ninth year of  his episcopate, and was buried before the high altar in his own  cathedral church.    [Illustration: The Cathedral in the Seventeenth Century.]    Bishop Eborard, who succeeded in 1121, is credited with having finished  the nave from the point where Herbert had left it. The evidence which  goes to support this theory is taken from the _Registrum Primum_.  \"Moreover, the same Herbert completed the church of Norwich in his own  time, as I have learned from the account of old people, but have not  found in writing, as far as the altar of the Holy Cross, which is now  called the altar of St. William. He also built all the episcopal  dwelling-house, except the great hall.\" The altar referred to was on the  north side of choir screen.    Herbert also provided the base for the tower only, probably up to the  roof level; the remainder, up to the parapet, was finished about the  time of Henry I., but at that earlier period it was without the stone  spire which now adds dignity to the cathedral from any point of view.    The roofs at this time were generally of a flat wooden construction  throughout (similar to that of Peterborough Cathedral), and probably  decorated with lozenges, flowers, and symbolical devices. When recently,  under Dean Lefroy, the whitewash and paint were cleaned off from the  stonework, many indications have been found of a most beautiful scheme  of colour decoration.    Though we, in this part, are following up the history of the cathedral  structure, yet it may be interesting to note that it was during the  episcopate of Bishop Eborard that the boy saint, St. William of Norwich,  was said to have been martyred. He was the son of country folk who  gained a living by agriculture. During his life he worked many miracles,  and by his death gave Norwich a share of his glory. It is related that  he was tortured by the Jews, and on the spot where they were discovered  secretly burying him, in Thorpe Wood, a chapel was erected called the  Chapel of St. William in the Wood. Very little now remains of this  structure, but the site can still be traced. The altar before referred  to was set up to his memory in Norwich Cathedral, on the north side of  the screen leading into the ante-choir.    Bishop Eborard resigned the see, or was deposed in 1145, and retired to  the abbey of Fontenay, Mont-Bard, Cote d'Or, in the South of France. He  had re-enforced a mandate of Herbert's that the clergy of the diocese  should contribute to the fund in aid of the fabric.    During the episcopate of Eborard's successor, Bishop William de Turbe,  the cathedral appears neither to have gained or suffered until, about  1169 or 1170, a fire broke out in the monastic buildings; the  fire-extinguishing appliances in those days, if indeed there were any at  all, could not prevent it spreading to the cathedral. It is generally  believed that the original Norman Lady Chapel was also well destroyed.    Bishop William de Turbe, although an old man at the time (he died in  1174), is said to have taken a vow that he would not go from within  twelve leucas of the cathedral, unless compelled by the direst  necessity, until the ravages of the flames had been repaired. He is  reported to have seated himself at the door of the cathedral, and to  have begged alms for this purpose from the worshippers. The work of  reparation was carried on by his successor, John of Oxford, who may also  be said to have completely finished Herbert's cathedral. He provided the  furniture of the church, the vestments, books and ornaments, and,  probably, entirely re-modelled the monastic buildings. He is also said  to have built the Infirmary, of which now only three piers remain, to  the south of the cloisters.    In the years following, various works were doubtless carried on, but it  is not until the time of Walter de Suffield, about 1250, that anything  important in the way of structural alteration was effected. The fire of  1169 had in part or whole destroyed the original Norman Lady Chapel, and  Bishop de Turbe had restored the same in some measure. But the _cultus_  of the Blessed Virgin in the interval had gathered strength wonderfully;  chapels dedicated to her naturally became important, and Bishop Suffield  determined to pull down the old Norman work and rebuild a chapel in the  Early English style then prevalent. Dean Goulburn, in his work on the  cathedral, estimated the size of the later chapel at 90 feet long by 30  feet wide, and these dimensions are shown plotted in dotted lines on the  plan in this book. This is longer and narrower than the size given in  previous conjectures, but Dean Goulburn had the opportunity of  inspecting the foundations of the chapel, which, with those of the still  earlier one, lie buried but a few feet below the surface in a garden to  the east of the cathedral. In the same place, and over the entrance  arches remaining, the height and lines of the later roof can be seen  still plainly marked on the stonework. These entrance arches are  beautifully moulded and decorated on the inside with the \"dog-tooth\"  ornament--a decoration peculiar to the Early English style.    The theological reaction which followed close on this movement led to  the neglect of the chapel, and obviated the necessity of maintaining it  as a place of worship. It had probably greatly decayed; that Dean  Gardiner (1573-89), no longer needing it for services, was tempted to  pull it down, as a cheaper expedient than keeping it in repair.    In 1271 Norwich was visited by a terrific thunderstorm, when the tower  was struck by lightning. The damage, however, was not great, as,  fortunately, the excessive rains which followed quenched the fire that  had been kindled. This incident, however, was the precursor of one of  the stormiest periods in the history of the city and its cathedral  church. Roger de Skerning occupied the episcopal chair, and the prior  was one William de Brunham, a man of fierce and truculent disposition.  An outbreak of hostilities between the citizens on the one hand and the  monks on the other, was brought about by his arbitrary assumption of  power; the bishop throughout, ostensibly preferring the safer game of a  somewhat anomalous position of neutrality, is nevertheless believed to  have covertly sanctioned his proceedings.    A fair was held in Tombland--to the west of the precincts--annually on  Trinity Sunday, and by right of ancient custom the priors reaped large  revenues by the imposition of tolls on the sales. Tombland, derived from  _Tomeland_, a vacant space, had originally formed part of the estate  bequeathed by Herbert, the founder, to the monks; the boundaries in  course of time had become matters of controversy, and it is probable  that the citizens felt the imposition of these tolls and dues to be a  real and serious grievance. A riot broke out and the monks were driven"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19719"],[0,"The Art Of Writing & Speaking The English Language (#3)"],[1,"is that the lists of  exceptions are often so formidable that we get discouraged and exclaim,  \"If nine tenths of the words I use every day are exceptions to the  rules, what is the use of the rules anyway!\"  Well, the words which  constitute that other tenth will aggregate in actual numbers far more  than the common words which form the chief part of everyday speech,  and as they are selected at random from a vastly larger number,  the only possible way to master them is by acquiring principles,  consciously or unconsciously, which will serve as a key to them.  Some people have the faculty of unconsciously formulating principles  from their everyday observations, but it is a slow process,  and many never acquire it unless it is taught them.    The spelling problem is not to learn how to spell nine tenths of  our words correctly.  Nearly all of us can and do accomplish that.  The good speller must spell nine hundred and ninety-nine one  thousandths of his word correctly, which is quite another matter.  Some of us go even one figure higher.    Our first task is clearly to commit the common irregular words to memory.  How may we do that most easily?  It is a huge task at best, but every  pound of life energy which we can save in doing it is so much gained for  higher efforts.  We should strive to economize effort in this just as  the manufacturer tries to economize in the cost of making his goods.    In this particular matter, it seems to the present writer that makers  of modern spelling-books have committed a great blunder in mixing  indiscriminately regular words with irregular, and common words with  uncommon.  Clearly we should memorize first the words we use most often,  and then take up those which we use less frequently.  But the  superintendent of the Evanston schools has reported that out of one  hundred first-reader words which he gave to his grammar classes as  a spelling test, some were misspelled by all but sixteen per cent{.} of  the pupils.  And yet these same pupils were studying busily away on  _categories, concatenation,_ and _amphibious_.  The spelling-book makers  feel that they must put hard words into their spellers.  Their books are  little more than lists of words, and any one can make lists of common, easy  words.  A spelling-book filled with common easy words would not seem to be  worth the price paid for it.  Pupils and teachers must get their money's  worth, even if they never learn to spell.  Of course the teachers are  expected to furnish drills themselves on the common, easy words; but  unfortunately they take their cue from the spelling-book, each day merely  assigning to the class the next page.  They haven't time to select, and no  one could consistently expect them to do otherwise than as they do do.    To meet this difficulty, the author of this book has prepared a version  of the story of Robinson Crusoe which contains a large proportion of  the common words which offer difficulty in spelling.  Unluckily it  is not easy to produce classic English when one is writing under the  necessity of using a vocabulary previously selected.  However, if we  concentrate our attention on the word-forms, we are not likely to be  much injured by the ungraceful sentence-forms.  This story is not long,  but it should be dictated to every school class, beginning in the  fourth grade, until _every_ pupil can spell _every_ word correctly.  A high percentage is not enough, as in the case of some other studies.  Any pupil who misses a single word in any exercise should be marked zero.    But even if one can spell correctly every word in this story, he may still  not be a good speller, for there are thousands of other words to be  spelled, many of which are not and never will be found in any  spelling-book.  The chief object of a course of study in spelling is to  acquire two habits, the habit of observing articulate sounds, and the habit  of observing word-forms in reading.    1.  Train the Ear.  Until the habit of observing articulate sounds  carefully has been acquired, the niceties of pronunciation are beyond  the student's reach, and equally the niceties of spelling are beyond his  reach, too.  In ordinary speaking, many vowels and even some consonants  are slurred and obscured.  If the ear is not trained to exactness,  this habit of slurring introduces many inaccuracies.  Even in careful  speaking, many obscure sounds are so nearly alike that only a finely  trained ear can detect any difference.  Who of us notices any  difference between _er_ in _pardoner_ and _or_ in _honor_?  Careful  speakers do not pass over the latter syllable quite so hastily as over  the former, but only the most finely trained ear will detect any  difference even in the pronunciation of the most finely trained voice.    In the lower grades in the schools the ear may be trained by giving  separate utterance to each sound in a given word, as f-r-e-n-d, _friend,_  allowing each letter only its true value in the word.  Still it may also be  obtained by requiring careful and distinct pronunciation in reading, not,  however, to the extent of exaggerating the value of obscure syllables,  or painfully accentuating syllables naturally obscure.    Adults (but seldom children) may train the ear by reading poetry aloud,  always guarding against the sing-song style, but trying to harmonize  nicely the sense and the rhythm.  A trained ear is absolutely necessary  to reading poetry well, and the constant reading aloud of poetry cannot  but afford an admirable exercise.    For children, the use of diacritical marks has little or no value, until  the necessity arises for consulting the dictionary for pronunciation.  They are but a mechanical system, and the system we commonly use is so  devoid of permanence in its character that every dictionary has a different  system.  The one most common in the schools is that introduced by Webster;  but if we would consult the Standard or the Century or the Oxford, we must  learn our system all over again.  To the child, any system is a clog and a  hindrance, and quite useless in teaching him phonetic values, wherein the  voice of the teacher is the true medium.    For older students, however, especially students at home, where no teacher  is available, phonetic writing by means of diacritical marks has great  value.*  It is the only practicable way of representing the sounds of the  voice on paper.  When the student writes phonetically he is obliged to  observe closely his own voice and the voices of others in ordinary speech,  and so his ear is trained.  It also takes the place of the voice for  dictation in spelling tests by mail or through the medium of books.     *There should be no more marks than there are sounds.  When two vowels  have the same sound one should be written as a substitute for the other,  as we have done in this book.    2.  Train the Eye.  No doubt the most effective way of learning spelling  is to train the eye carefully to observe the forms of the words we read  in newspapers and in books.  If this habit is formed, and the habit of  general reading accompanies it, it is sufficient to make a nearly  perfect speller.  The great question is, how to acquire it.    Of course in order to read we are obliged to observe the forms of words  in a general way, and if this were all that is needed, we should all  be good spellers if we were able to read fluently.  But it is not all.  The observation of the general form of a word is not the observation  that teaches spelling.  We must have the habit of observing every  letter in every word, and this we are not likely to have unless  we give special attention to acquiring it.    The \"visualization\" method of teaching spelling now in use in the  schools is along the line of training the eye to observe every letter  in a word.  It is good so far as it goes; but it does not go very far.  The reason is that there is a limit to the powers of the memory,  especially in the observation of arbitrary combinations of letters.  What habits of visualization would enable the ordinary person to  glance at such a combination as the following and write it ten minutes  afterward with no aid but the single glance: _hwgufhtbizwskoplmne?_  It would require some minutes' study to memorize such a combination,  because there is nothing to aid us but the sheer succession of forms.  The memory works by association.  We build up a vast structure of  knowledge, and each new fact or form must be as securely attached  to this as the new wing of a building; and the more points at which  attachment can be formed the more easily is the addition made.    The Mastery of Irregular Words.    Here, then, we have the real reason for a long study of principles,  analogies, and classifications.  They help us to remember.  If I come to the word _colonnade_ in reading, I observe at once that  the double _n_ is an irregularity.  It catches my eye immediately.  \"Ah!\" I reflect almost in the fraction of a second as I read in  continuous flow, \"here is another of those exceptions.\"  Building on  what I already know perfectly well, I master this word with the very  slightest effort.  If we can build up a system which will serve the  memory by way of association, so that the slight effort that can be  given in ordinary reading will serve to fix a word more or less fully,  we can soon acquire a marvellous power in the accurate spelling of words.    Again: In a spelling-book before me I see lists of words ending in _ise,  ize,_ and _yse,_ all mixed together with no distinction.  The arrangement  suggests memorizing every word in the language ending with either of these  terminations, and until we have memorized any particular word we have no  means of knowing what the termination is.  If, however, we are taught that  _ize_ is the common ending, that _ise_ is the ending of only thirty-one  words, and _yse_ of only three or four, we reduce our task enormously and  aid the"]]]
