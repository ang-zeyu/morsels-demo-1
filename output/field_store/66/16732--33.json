He saw the girl, and raised his hat.    \"Come along, Miss Beale,\" he said. \"I promise you a more comfortable  ride--even if I cannot guarantee that the end will be less startling.\"          Chapter III      The man who had opened the door was a short, stoutly built person of  middle age. He took the girl's arm gently, and without questioning she  accompanied him to the car ahead, the man in the raincoat following. No  word was spoken, and Lydia was too bewildered to ask questions until the  car was on its way. Then the younger man chuckled.    \"Clever, Rennett!\" he said. \"I tell you, those people are super-humanly  brilliant!\"    \"I'm not a great admirer of villainy,\" said the other gruffly, and the  younger man, who was sitting opposite the girl, laughed.    \"You must take a detached interest, my dear chap. Personally, I admire  them. I admit they gave me a fright when I realised that Miss Beale had  not called the cab, but that it had been carefully planted for her, but  still I can admire them.\"    \"What does it mean?\" asked the puzzled girl. \"I'm so confused--where are  we going now? To the office?\"    \"I fear you will not get to the office to-night,\" said the young man  calmly, \"and it is impossible to explain to you just why you were  abducted.\"    \"Abducted?\" said the girl incredulously. \"Do you mean to say that  man----\"    \"He was carrying you into the country,\" said the other calmly. \"He would  probably have travelled all night and have left you stranded in some  un-get-at-able place. I don't think he meant any harm--they never take  unnecessary risks, and all they wanted was to spirit you away for the  night. How they came to know that we had chosen you baffles me,\" he  said. \"Can you advance any theory, Rennett?\"    \"Chosen me?\" repeated the startled girl. \"Really, I feel I'm entitled to  some explanation, and if you don't mind, I would like you to take me  back to my office. I have a job to keep,\" she added grimly.    \"Six pounds ten a week, and a few guineas extra for your illustrations,\"  said the man in the raincoat. \"Believe me, Miss Beale, you'll never pay  off your debts on that salary, not if you live to be a hundred.\"    She could only gasp.    \"You seem to know a great deal about my private affairs,\" she said, when  she had recovered her breath.    \"A great deal more than you can imagine.\"    She guessed he was smiling in the darkness, and his voice was so gentle  and apologetic that she could not take offence.    \"In the past twelve months you have had thirty-nine judgments recorded  against you, and in the previous year, twenty-seven. You are living on  exactly thirty shillings a week, and all the rest is going to your  father's creditors.\"    \"You're very impertinent!\" she said hotly and, as she felt, foolishly.    \"I'm very pertinent, really. By the way, my name is Glover--John Glover,  of the firm of Rennett, Glover and Simpson. The gentleman at your side  is Mr. Charles Rennett, my senior partner. We are a firm of solicitors,  but how long we shall remain a firm,\" he added pointedly, \"depends  rather upon you.\"    \"Upon me?\" said the girl in genuine astonishment. \"Well, I can't say  that I have so much love for lawyers----\"    \"That I can well understand,\" murmured Mr. Glover.    \"But I certainly do not wish to dissolve your partnership,\" she went on.    \"It is rather more serious than that,\" said Mr. Rennett, who was sitting  by her side. \"The fact is, Miss Beale, we are acting in a perfectly  illegal manner, and we are going to reveal to you the particulars of an  act we contemplate, which, if you pass on the information to the police,  will result in our professional ruin. So you see this adventure is  infinitely more important to us than at present it is to you. And here  we are!\" he said, interrupting the girl's question.    The car turned into a narrow drive, and proceeded some distance through  an avenue of trees before it pulled up at the pillared porch of a big  house.    Rennett helped her to alight and ushered her through the door, which  opened almost as they stopped, into a large panelled hall.    \"This is the way, let me show you,\" said the younger man.    He opened a door and she found herself in a big drawing-room,  exquisitely furnished and lit by two silver electroliers suspended from  the carved roof.    To her relief an elderly woman rose to greet her.    \"This is my wife, Miss Beale,\" said Rennett. \"I need hardly explain that  this is also my home.\"    \"So you found the young lady,\" said the elderly lady, smiling her  welcome, \"and what does Miss Beale think of your proposition?\"    The young man Glover came in at that moment, and divested of his long  raincoat and hat, he proved to be of a type that the Universities turn  out by the hundred. He was good-looking too, Lydia noticed with feminine  inconsequence, and there was something in his eyes that inspired trust.  He nodded with a smile to Mrs. Rennett, then turned to the girl.    \"Now Miss Beale, I don't know whether I ought to explain or whether my  learned and distinguished friend prefers to save me the trouble.\"    \"Not me,\" said the elder man hastily. \"My dear,\" he turned to his wife,  \"I think we'll leave Jack Glover to talk to this young lady.\"    \"Doesn't she know?\" asked Mrs. Rennett in surprise, and Lydia laughed,  although she was feeling far from amused.    The possible loss of her employment, the disquieting adventure of the  evening, and now this further mystery all combined to set her nerves on  edge.    Glover waited until the door closed on his partner and his wife and  seemed inclined to wait a little longer, for he stood with his back to  the fire, biting his lips and looking down thoughtfully at the carpet.    \"I don't just know how to begin, Miss Beale,\" he said. \"And having seen  you, my conscience is beginning to work overtime. But I might as well  start at the beginning. I suppose you have heard of the Bulford murder?\"    The girl stared at him.    \"The Bulford murder?\" she said incredulously, and he nodded.    \"Why, of course, everybody has heard of that.\"    \"Then happily it is unnecessary to explain all the circumstances,\" said  Jack Glover, with a little grimace of distaste.    \"I only know,\" interrupted the girl, \"that Mr. Bulford was killed by a  Mr. Meredith, who was jealous of him, and that Mr. Meredith, when he  went into the witness-box, behaved disgracefully to his fiancee.\"    \"Exactly,\" nodded Glover with a twinkle in his eye. \"In other words, he  repudiated the suggestion that he was jealous, swore that he had already  told Miss Briggerland that he could not marry her, and he did not even  know that Bulford was paying attention to the lady.\"    \"He did that to save his life,\" said Lydia quietly. \"Miss Briggerland  swore in the witness-box that no such interview had occurred.\"    Glover nodded.    \"What you do not know, Miss Beale,\" he said gravely, \"is that Jean  Briggerland was Meredith's cousin, and unless certain things happen, she  will inherit the greater part of six hundred thousand pounds from  Meredith's estate. Meredith, I might explain, is one of my best friends,  and the fact that he is now serving out a life sentence does not make  him any less a friend. I am as sure, as I am sure of your sitting there,  that he no more killed Bulford than I did. I believe the whole thing  was a plot to secure his death or imprisonment. My partner thinks the  same. The truth is that Meredith was engaged to this girl; he discovered  certain things about her and her father which are not greatly to their  credit. He was never really in love with her, beautiful as she is, and  he was trapped into the proposal. When he found out how things were  shaping and heard some of the queer stories which were told about  Briggerland and his daughter, he broke off the engagement and went that  night to tell her so.\"    The girl had listened in some bewilderment to this recital.    \"I don't exactly see what all this is to do with me,\" she said, and  again Jack Glover nodded.    \"I can quite understand,\" he said, \"but I will tell you yet another part  of the story which is not public property. Meredith's father was an  eccentric man who believed in early marriages, and it was a condition of  his will that if Meredith was not married by his thirtieth birthday, the  money should go to his sister, her heirs and successors. His sister was  Mrs. Briggerland, who is now dead. Her heirs are her husband and Jean  Briggerland.\"    There was a silence. The girl stared thoughtfully into the fire.    \"How old is Mr. Meredith?\"    \"He is thirty next Monday,\" said Glover quietly, \"and it is necessary  that he should be married before next Monday.\"    \"In prison?\" she asked.    He shook his head.    \"If such things are allowed that could have been arranged, but for some  reason the Home Secretary refuses to exercise his discretion in this  matter, and has resolutely refused to allow such a marriage to take  place. He objects on the ground of public policy, and I dare say from  his point of view he is right. Meredith has a twenty-years sentence to  serve.\"    \"Then how----\" began Lydia.    \"Let me tell this story more or less understandably,\" said Glover with  that little smile of his. \"Believe me, Miss Beale, I'm not so keen upon  the scheme as I was. If by chance,\" he spoke deliberately, \"we could get  James Meredith into this house to-morrow morning, would you marry him?\"    \"Me?\" she gasped. \"Marry a man I've not seen--a murderer?\"    \"Not a murderer,\" he said gently.    \"But it is preposterous, impossible!\" she protested. \"Why me?\" "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21531"],[0,"Woodwork Joints: How They Are Set Out, How Made and Where Used. (#3)"],[1,"in similar positions to Fig. 33, and rather less  labour is required in the making. The two pieces are shown separate for  clearness.    Fig. 36 indicates the \"Halved Joint,\" the pieces at one end showing a  double dovetail (Fig. 28, 7). This particular joint is seldom used except  for Manual Training purposes. The illustration shows a sketch of the  joint apart.    Fig. 37 is \"Oblique Dovetail Halving,\" one side of the piece being  dovetailed. The joint is used to prevent \"racking,\" and as a cross brace  to framing. It is occasionally made with both its sides dovetailed as  shown at Fig. 33. (For reference, see Fig. 28, 9.)    [Illustration: Fig. 35.--Halved Joint with one side Dovetailed.]    [Illustration: Fig. 36.--Halved Joint with Double Dovetail.]    [Illustration: Fig. 37.--Oblique Dovetail Halving.]    [Illustration: Fig. 38.--Stopped Dovetail Halving.]    Fig. 38 shows \"Stopped Dovetail Halving.\" In this case the dovetail is  similar to Fig. 33, with the exception that it does not run through the  bottom rail. This is an advantage if the bottom edge of the rail is in  evidence, or if it is required to glue a moulding or hardwood facing slip  on the lower edge. The glue adheres better _with_ the grain than it would  _end way_ of the grain, and if slight shrinkage occurs across the width  of the bottom rail the moulding would not be forced away by the upright  (see example at Fig. 28, 10).    [Illustration: Fig. 39.--Cross Halving Joint.]    [Illustration: Fig. 40.--Cross Halving Joint Edgeways.]    [Illustration: Fig. 41.--Tee Halving Joint.]    The joint lettered B in Fig. 28 is a \"Cross Halving Joint\" where each  piece runs through the other. Fig. 39 shows this joint separated, and  Fig. 40 shows a similar joint separated where the joint is made edgeways.    Fig. 41 shows a \"Tee Halving Joint\" with a dovetail cut on the edge. This  is seldom used except as a woodwork exercise.    Fig. 42 is a \"Dovetailed Halving Joint\" used for lengthening timber, and  is also a favourite Manual Training model. It might also come under the  heading of scarf joint, although rarely used in actual practice as such.  As a practical woodwork exercise it calls for accurate marking out and  careful fitting.    [Illustration: Fig. 42.--Dovetailed Halving Joint used for Lengthening  Timber.]    [Illustration: Fig. 43.--Dovetailed and Halved Joint.]    [Illustration: Fig. 44.--Dovetailed Halved Joint with Shoulders.]    Fig. 43 shows a combination of a halved joint dovetailed edgeways, whilst  Fig. 44 shows a dovetailed halved joint with the shoulders housed. This  latter is seldom used in actual work.    At Fig. 45 we have the application of halving joints when constructing a  barrow wheel. The centre portion is an example of three pieces  half-lapped or, as it is sometimes called, one-third lapped. A sketch of  the three pieces separated is shown at L, B, C, Fig. 46.    This joint is extensively used in the pattern making trade for  lap-jointing the arms of pulley patterns, etc. It is probably the most  difficult of the halving joints to mark out and construct with the  desired degree of accuracy.    [Illustration: Fig. 45.--Halved Joints on Barrow Wheels.]    [Illustration: Fig. 46.--Detail of Halved Joints in Fig. 45.]    Fig. 47 shows a combination of a bevelled dovetail half-lapped joint.  This is only used as a puzzle joint. When neatly constructed and glued  together it is apparently impossible to make it, showing as it does a  half lap on one side and a dovetailed half lap on the reverse side.    Fig. 48 is the end view of a kitchen table with drop leaf,  showing the skirting board scribed to the solid side. A table of  this type is fastened to the wall with two iron holdfasts which  engage the ends of the table. The hinged bracket frame shows the  application of the halving joint to bracket supports for this and  similar purposes, such as brackets to support shelving, etc. In  this example the hinged brackets turn underneath the table top,  and allow the leaf to drop out of the way when not required. The  dotted lines show the position of a shelf for boots and shoes.

[Illustration: Fig. 55.--Cross Halving Joint with Housed Corners.]    [Illustration: Fig. 56.--The parts of Fig. 55 shown separate.]    Fig. 51 is an \"Oblique Cross Halving Joint\" where the two pieces are not  at right angles. A plan and elevation of the joint are shown at the left,  whilst a sketch of one piece of the joint is given in the right-hand  illustration.    Figs. 52 and 53 are principally used as Manual Training models, and call  for patience and manual dexterity.    Fig. 54 is used in carpentry and joinery where a tie or cross piece ties  joists or beams at an angle.    Fig. 55 shows the elevation and end view of a \"Cross Halving Joint\" with  housed or notched shoulders. This joint is seldom used in actual  practice. The separate parts are given in Fig. 56.    At Fig. 57 are shown two cross rails and an upright halved together. This  type of joint is used where three pieces meet, as is the case in  building the framing of a poultry house. The joint is nailed together.    [Illustration: Fig. 57.--Cross Rail and Upright Halved Joint.]    [Illustration: Fig. 58.--Workshop Trestle Joint.]    [Illustration: Fig. 59.--Cellarette Partition Joints.]    Fig. 58 is the end view of an ordinary workshop trestle, showing the  application of dovetailed halving where the legs have a tendency to  strain outwards. The inset sketch of joint shows the housing of the top  rail to receive the legs.    Fig. 59 shows a deep drawer, generally known as a cellarette, and used in  a sideboard to accommodate wine bottles. Here we have a good example of  halving the cross pieces so as to form compartments. The part shown  separately illustrates the method of construction. The ends of these  pieces engage the housings or grooves of the drawer sides. Pigeon holes  or compartments in stationery cases, bookcases and writing bureaux are  constructed in a similar manner, although the method of housing, or  combined halving and housing, is to be preferred in some cases.    [Illustration: Fig. 60.--Joint used for Table with Circular Top or Rim.]    At Fig. 60 is the plan of a circular table having a small circular shelf  with the top removed. The rims or framing are built by the method known  as laminating (see Fig. 23 in chapter on the The Glued Joint), after  which they are veneered on the face sides. The application of the  halving joint to the shaped bottom rails, which in this case carry and  support the small shelf, is shown in the part elevation.    [Illustration: Fig. 61 (A).--Oxford Frame with Halved Joints. (Four  alternative corner treatments are given.)]    [Illustration: Fig. 61 (B).--Halved Joint of Oxford Frame with front  edges champered.]    [Illustration: Fig. 61 (C).--Back view of Oxford Frame.]    Fig. 61 (A) shows the well-known \"Oxford frame,\" illustrating halved  joints when the edge is rebated. Figs. 61 (B) and 61 (C) make clear the  construction of this type of joint. Alternative suggestions are shown for  the treatment of the corners, the simple inlay being black and white  (ebony and holly or boxwood). Frames of this type are made in various  widths and sizes and are used for pictures, mirrors, etc.    [Illustration: Fig. 62.--The Two Pieces of a Halved Joint.]    The tools used for making joints of the above class are: planes, the  gauge, tenon or other saw, chisels, try square, and in some cases a  joiner's bevel to obtain and mark the necessary angles, pencil and  marking knife.    Plane up the face side and face edge of the timber, gauge and plane to  both thickness and width; mark shoulders with pencil or marking knife;  gauge to the thickness of the required halving; saw waste portions away;  pare up with chisel to a good fit; glue or glue and screw, or use paint  as previously mentioned, and then level off the surfaces.    SETTING OUT THE HALVED JOINT.--Although at first sight the halved joint  may appear to be a very easy item of construction, it requires much care  and attention in marking out and sawing. Fig. 62 shows the two pieces  which form the joint separated, and it will be noticed that each piece of  wood has half its thickness cut away, so as to accommodate the other  piece. This type of joint is used where two pieces of wood cross each  other at right angles, or at an angle as shown in Fig. 51. The halving  joint is used also for joining two pieces of wood at their ends, as, for  instance, the corner of a frame, one half of this joint being shown at  Fig. 65 (B).    [Illustration: Fig. 63.--How the Timber is Marked.]    [Illustration: Fig. 64.--Marking the Joint with Try Square.]    To make the joint, the timber should be carefully planed to its exact  width and thickness. The two pieces may then be placed upon the bench (as  shown at Fig. 63) or fixed in the vice.    Find the centre of the timber, C, Fig. 63, and set out half the width of  the wood on each side of the dotted centre line. Thus, suppose the wood  (W) to be 2 ins. wide, then set 1 in. on each side of the centre line.  Take a square as at Fig. 64, and with a sharp penknife blade score or cut  a line all round each piece of timber.
