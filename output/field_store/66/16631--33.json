(M3)    The influence of an over-lord for good or evil, over those subject to his  authority, was immense. Take for instance, Sheffield, which was subject,  in the reign of Elizabeth, to the Earl of Shrewsbury. The cutlery trade,  even in those days, was the main-stay of the town, and yet the earl could  make and unmake the rules and ordinances which governed the Cutlers'  Company, and could claim one half of the fines imposed on its members.(5)    When, during the reign of Charles II, nearly every municipal borough in  the kingdom was forced to surrender its charter to the king, the citizens  of Durham surrendered theirs to the Bishop, who, to the intense horror of  a contemporary writer, reserved to himself and his successors in the See  the power of approving and confirming the mayor, aldermen, recorder, and  common council of that city.(6)    (M4)    The commercial greatness of London can be traced back to the time of the  Roman occupation of Britain. From being little more than a stockaded fort,  situate at a point on the river's bank which admitted of an easy passage  by ferry across to Southwark, London prospered under the protection  afforded to its traders by the presence of the Roman legions, but it never  in those days became the capital of the province. Although a flourishing  centre of commerce in the middle of the first century of the Christian  era, it was not deemed of sufficient importance by Suetonius, the Roman  general, to run the risk of defending against Boadicea,(7) and although  thought worthy of the title of Augusta--a name bestowed only on towns of  exceptional standing--the Romans did not hesitate to leave both town and  province to their fate as soon as danger threatened them nearer home.    (M5)    For military no less than for commercial purposes--and the Roman occupation  of Britain was mainly a military one--good roads were essential, and these  the Romans excelled in making. It is remarkable that in the Itinerary of  Antoninus Pius, London figures either as the starting point or as the  terminus to nearly one-half of the routes described in the portion  relating to Britain.(8) The name of one and only one of these Roman  highways survives in the city at the present day, and then only in its  Teutonic and not Roman form--the Watling or \"Wathelinga\" Street, the street  which led from Kent through the city of London to Chester and York, and  thence by two branches to Carlisle and the neighbourhood of Newcastle. The  Ermin Street, another Roman road with a Teutonic name, led from London to  Lincoln, with branches to Doncaster and York, but its name no longer  survives in the city.    (M6)    The same reasons that led the Romans to establish good roads throughout  the country led them also to erect a bridge across the river from London  to Southwark, and in later years to enclose the city with a wall. To the  building of the bridge, which probably took place in the early years of  the Roman occupation, London owed much of its youthful prosperity;  whenever any accident happened to the bridge the damage was always  promptly repaired. Not so with the walls of the city. They were allowed to  fall into decay until the prudence and military genius of the great Alfred  caused them to be repaired as a bulwark against the onslaughts of the  Danes.    (M7)    \"Britain had been occupied by the Romans, but had not become Roman,\"(9)  and the scanty and superficial civilization which the Britons had received  from the Roman occupation was obliterated by the calamities which followed  the northern invasions of the fifth and following centuries. A Christian  city, as Augusta had probably been, not a vestige of a Christian church of  the Roman period has come down to us.(10) It quickly lapsed into paganism.  Its very name disappears, and with it the names of its streets, its  traditions and its customs. Its inhabitants forgot the Latin tongue, and  the memories of 400 years were clean wiped out. There remains to us of the  present day nothing to remind us of London under the Roman empire, save a  fragment of a wall, a milestone, a few coins and statuettes, and some  articles of personal ornament or domestic use--little more in fact, than  what may be seen in the Museum attached to the Guildhall Library. The long  subjection to Roman rule had one disastrous effect. It enervated the  people and left them powerless to cope with those enemies who, as soon as  the iron hand of the Roman legions was removed, came forth from their  hiding places to harry the land.    (M8)    Thus it was that when the Picts and Scots again broke loose from their  northern fastnesses and threatened London as they had done before (A.D.  368), they once more appealed for aid to the Roman emperor, by whose  assistance the marauders had formerly been driven back. But times were  different in 446 to what they had been in 368. The Roman empire was itself  threatened with an invasion of the Goths, and the emperor had his hands  too full to allow him to lend a favourable ear to the \"groans of the  Britons.\"(11)    (M9)    Compelled to seek assistance elsewhere, the Britons invited a tribe of  warriors, ever ready to let their services for hire, from the North Sea,  to lend them their aid. The foreigners came in answer to the invitation,  they saw, they conquered; and then they refused to leave an island the  fertility of which they appreciated no less than they despised the  slothfulness of its inhabitants.(12) They turned their weapons against  their employers, and utterly routed them at Crayford, driving them to take  refuge within the walls of London.    (M10)    \"A.D. 457 (456). This year Hengist and AEsc [Eric or Ash] his son fought  against the Britons at a place called Creegan-Ford [Crayford] and there  slew four thousand men, and the Britons then forsook Kent, and in great  terror fled to London.\"(13) So runs the Anglo-Saxon chronicle, and this is  the sole piece of information concerning London it vouchsafes us for one  hundred and fifty years following the departure of the Romans. The  information, scant as it is, serves to show that London had not quite  become a deserted city, nor had yet been devastated as others had been by  the enemy. Its walls still served to afford shelter to the terrified  refugees.    (M11)    When next we read of her, she is in the possession of the East Saxons. How  they came there is a matter for conjecture. It is possible that with the  whole of the surrounding counties in the hands of the enemy, the Londoners  were driven from their city to seek means of subsistence elsewhere, and  that when the East Saxons took possession of it, they found houses and  streets deserted. Little relishing a life within a town, they probably did  not make a long stay, and, on their departure, the former inhabitants  returned and the city slowly recovered its wonted appearance, as the  country around became more settled.    (M12)    Christianity in the country had revived, and London was now to receive its  first bishop. It is the year 604. \"This year,\" writes the chronicler,  \"Augustine hallowed two bishops, Mellitus and Justus; Mellitus he sent to  preach baptism to the East Saxons, whose king was called Seberht, son of  Ricula, the sister of Ethelbert whom Ethelbert had there set as king. And  Ethelbert gave to Mellitus a bishop's see at London.\" This passage is  remarkable for two reasons:--(1) as shewing us that London was at this time  situate in Essex, the kingdom of the East Saxons, and (2) that Seberht was  but a _roi faineant_, enjoying no real independence in spite of his  dignity as ruler of the East Saxons and nominal master of London, his  uncle Ethelbert, king of the Cantii, exercising a hegemony over \"all the  nations of the English as far as the Humber.\" (14)    Hence it is that London is spoken of by some as being the _metropolis_ of  the East Saxons,(15) and by others as being the principal city of the  Cantii;(16) the fact being that, though locally situate in Essex, it was  deemed the political capital of that kingdom which for the time being  happened to be paramount.    (M13)    After the death of Seberht, the Londoners became dissatisfied with their  bishop and drove him out. Mellitus became in course of time Archbishop of  Canterbury, whilst the Londoners again relapsed into paganism.(17) Not  only was the erection of a cathedral in the city due to Ethelbert, but it  was also at his instigation, if not with his treasure, that Seberht, the  \"wealthy sub-king of London,\" was, as is believed, induced to found the  Abbey of Westminster.(18)    (M14)    When the Saxon kingdoms became united under Egbert and he became _rex  totius Britanniae_ (A.D. 827), London began to take a more prominent place  among the cities of the kingdom, notwithstanding its having been three  times destroyed by fire between 674 and 801.(19) It became more often the  seat of the royal residence, and the scene of witena-gemots; nevertheless  it was not the seat of government, much less the capital. Then and for a  long time to come it had a formidable rival in Winchester, the chief town  of Egbert's own kingdom of Wessex. To Winchester that king proceeded in  triumph after completing the union of the Saxon kingdoms, and thither he  summoned his vassals to hear himself proclaimed their overlord. From  Winchester, Alfred, too, promulgated his new code of Wessex law--a part of  the famous _Domboc_, a copy of which is said to have been at one time  preserved among the archives of the City of London(20)--and the Easter  gemot, no matter where the other gemots of the year were held, was nearly  always held at Winchester. When it came to a question of trade regulation,  then London took precedence of Winchester. \"Let one measure and one weight  pass, such as is observed at London and at Winchester,\"(21) enacted King  Edgar,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19805"],[0,"The Tale of Mr. Tod (#3)"],[1,"it from the hook, dangling  over the head of Tommy Brock, in order to make a sort of shower-bath,  worked by a string, through the window.    [Illustration]    But naturally being a thin-legged person (though vindictive and sandy  whiskered)--he was quite unable to lift the heavy weight to the level of  the hook and rope. He very nearly overbalanced himself.    The snores became more and more apoplectic. One of Tommy Brock's hind  legs twitched under the blanket, but still he slept on peacefully.    Mr. Tod and the pail descended from the chair without accident. After  considerable thought, he emptied the water into a wash-basin and jug.  The empty pail was not too heavy for him; he slung it up wobbling over  the head of Tommy Brock.    Surely there never was such a sleeper! Mr. Tod got up and down, down and  up on the chair.    As he could not lift the whole pailful of water at once, he fetched a  milk jug, and ladled quarts of water into the pail by degrees. The pail  got fuller and fuller, and swung like a pendulum. Occasionally a drop  splashed over; but still Tommy Brock snored regularly and never  moved,--except one eye.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    At last Mr. Tod's preparations were complete. The pail was full of  water; the rope was tightly strained over the top of the bed, and across  the window sill to the tree outside.    \"It will make a great mess in my bedroom; but I could never sleep in  that bed again without a spring cleaning of some sort,\" said Mr. Tod.    [Illustration]    Mr. Tod took a last look at the badger and softly left the room. He went  out of the house, shutting the front door. The rabbits heard his  footsteps over the tunnel.    He ran round behind the house, intending to undo the rope in order to  let fall the pailful of water upon Tommy Brock--    \"I will wake him up with an unpleasant surprise,\" said Mr. Tod.    The moment he had gone, Tommy Brock got up in a hurry; he rolled Mr.  Tod's dressing-gown into a bundle, put it into the bed beneath the pail  of water instead of himself, and left the room also--grinning immensely.    He went into the kitchen, lighted the fire and boiled the kettle; for  the moment he did not trouble himself to cook the baby rabbits.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    When Mr. Tod got to the tree, he found that the weight and strain had  dragged the knot so tight that it was past untying. He was obliged to  gnaw it with his teeth. He chewed and gnawed for more than twenty  minutes. At last the rope gave way with such a sudden jerk that it  nearly pulled his teeth out, and quite knocked him over backwards.    [Illustration]    Inside the house there was a great crash and splash, and the noise of a  pail rolling over and over.    But no screams. Mr. Tod was mystified; he sat quite still, and listened  attentively. Then he peeped in at the window. The water was dripping  from the bed, the pail had rolled into a corner.    In the middle of the bed under the blanket, was a wet flattened  _something_--much dinged in, in the middle where the pail had caught it  (as it were across the tummy). Its head was covered by the wet blanket  and it was _not snoring any longer_.    There was nothing stirring, and no sound except the drip, drop, drop  drip of water trickling from the mattress.    [Illustration]    Mr. Tod watched it for half an hour; his eyes glistened.    Then he cut a caper, and became so bold that he even tapped at the  window; but the bundle never moved.    Yes--there was no doubt about it--it had turned out even better than he  had planned; the pail had hit poor old Tommy Brock, and killed him  dead!    \"I will bury that nasty person in the hole which he has dug. I will  bring my bedding out, and dry it in the sun,\" said Mr. Tod.    \"I will wash the tablecloth and spread it on the grass in the sun to  bleach. And the blanket must be hung up in the wind; and the bed must be  thoroughly disinfected, and aired with a warming-pan; and warmed with a  hot-water bottle.\"    [Illustration]    \"I will get soft soap, and monkey soap, and all sorts of soap; and soda  and scrubbing brushes; and persian powder; and carbolic to remove the  smell. I must have a disinfecting. Perhaps I may have to burn sulphur.\"    He hurried round the house to get a shovel from the kitchen--\"First I  will arrange the hole--then I will drag out that person in the  blanket....\"    He opened the door....    Tommy Brock was sitting at Mr. Tod's kitchen table, pouring out tea from  Mr. Tod's tea-pot into Mr. Tod's tea-cup. He was quite dry himself and  grinning; and he threw the cup of scalding tea all over Mr. Tod.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    Then Mr. Tod rushed upon Tommy Brock, and Tommy Brock grappled with Mr.  Tod amongst the broken crockery, and there was a terrific battle all  over the kitchen. To the rabbits underneath it sounded as if the floor  would give way at each crash of falling furniture.    They crept out of their tunnel, and hung about amongst the rocks and  bushes, listening anxiously.    [Illustration]    Inside the house the racket was fearful. The rabbit babies in the oven  woke up trembling; perhaps it was fortunate they were shut up inside.    Everything was upset except the kitchen table.    And everything was broken, except the mantelpiece and the kitchen  fender. The crockery was smashed to atoms.    The chairs were broken, and the window, and the clock fell with a crash,  and there were handfuls of Mr. Tod's sandy whiskers.    The vases fell off the mantelpiece, the canisters fell off the shelf;  the kettle fell off the hob. Tommy Brock put his foot in a jar of  raspberry jam.    And the boiling water out of the kettle fell upon the tail of Mr. Tod.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    When the kettle fell, Tommy Brock, who was still grinning, happened to  be uppermost; and he rolled Mr. Tod over and over like a log, out at the  door.    Then the snarling and worrying went on outside; and they rolled over the  bank, and down hill, bumping over the rocks. There will never be any  love lost between Tommy Brock and Mr. Tod.    [Illustration]    As soon as the coast was clear, Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny came out  of the bushes--    \"Now for it! Run in, Cousin Benjamin! Run in and get them! while I watch  at the door.\"    But Benjamin was frightened--    \"Oh; oh! they are coming back!\"    \"No they are not.\"    \"Yes they are!\"    \"What dreadful bad language! I think they have fallen down the stone  quarry.\"    Still Benjamin hesitated, and Peter kept pushing him--    \"Be quick, it's all right. Shut the oven door, Cousin Benjamin, so that  he won't miss them.\"    Decidedly there were lively doings in Mr. Tod's kitchen!    [Illustration]    At home in the rabbit hole, things had not been quite comfortable.    After quarrelling at supper, Flopsy and old Mr. Bouncer had passed a  sleepless night, and quarrelled again at breakfast. Old Mr. Bouncer  could no longer deny that he had invited company into the rabbit hole;  but he refused to reply to the questions and reproaches of Flopsy. The  day passed heavily.    Old Mr. Bouncer, very sulky, was huddled up in a corner, barricaded with  a chair. Flopsy had taken away his pipe and hidden the tobacco. She had  been having a complete turn out and spring-cleaning, to relieve her  feelings. She had just finished. Old Mr. Bouncer, behind his chair, was  wondering anxiously what she would do next.    [Illustration]    In Mr. Tod's kitchen, amongst the wreckage, Benjamin Bunny picked his  way to the oven nervously, through a thick cloud of dust. He opened the  oven door, felt inside, and found something warm and wriggling. He  lifted it out carefully, and rejoined Peter Rabbit.    \"I've got them! Can we get away? Shall we hide, Cousin Peter?\"    Peter pricked his ears; distant sounds of fighting still echoed in the  wood.    Five minutes afterwards two breathless rabbits came scuttering away down  Bull Banks, half carrying half dragging a sack between them, bumpetty  bump over the grass. They reached home safely and burst into the rabbit  hole.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    Great was old Mr. Bouncer's relief and Flopsy's joy when Peter and  Benjamin arrived in triumph with the young family. The rabbit-babies  were rather tumbled and very hungry; they were fed and put to bed. They  soon recovered.    A long new pipe and a fresh supply of rabbit tobacco was presented to  Mr. Bouncer. He was rather upon his dignity; but he accepted.    [Illustration]    Old Mr. Bouncer was forgiven, and they all had dinner. Then Peter and  Benjamin told their story--but they had not waited long enough to be  able to tell the end of the battle between Tommy Brock and Mr. Tod."]]]
