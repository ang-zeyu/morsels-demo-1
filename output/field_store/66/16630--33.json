Assistance to local authorities has been given on three conditions,  approved by the Minister of Education at the inception of the Service.  The third of these conditions is that the \"local authority should  maintain the library at a reasonable standard of service\".    Country Library Service assistance to libraries has always been planned  as service to assist local effort, not to supplant it. Where the local  service does not reach a certain standard a certain proportion of the  Country Library Service assistance loses its force. No matter how much  the assistance is increased the local people cannot benefit fully from  it unless the local authority houses it in a fair building, grafts it on  to a reasonable local book collection, and has the whole serviced by an  active and informed librarian. Continuity of good service is assured  only when the basic objectives of library service are enunciated and  clearly understood by the local authority.    Local authorities have not abused the flexible interpretation given to  the \"reasonable standard of service\" condition, but have appreciated the  fact that the Country Library Service always took into consideration any  local difficulties that existed. Libraries generously supported by their  local authorities without exception have made full use of all the  services the Government has offered, and the local people have benefited  from a first-class library service in its fullest cultural and  educational sense.    Local provision has naturally varied, but since 1950 the pattern of  local achievement has become more apparent, and the possibility was seen  of drawing up some code for evaluation. Local authorities participating  in this service were consulted and agreed to provide statistical notes  on their own work. These data formed the basis of a draft statement  which set out standards under headings of functions, service, staff,  books, and buildings, and which was sent to local authorities for  comment. It was gratifying to receive replies from so many, saying that  they would consider such a statement quite fair and reasonable.  Accordingly, the \"Minimum Standards for Public Libraries Participating  in the Country Library Service\" was approved by the Minister of  Education on 22 April 1958 and issued formally.    The document emphasises that it gives standards for minimum provision,  and that local authorities aiming to give good service will not be  satisfied until they are exceeded. That they are exceeded in several  centres is a matter for congratulation, and the local authorities  concerned have reason to be proud of their libraries, and are in every  case anxious to maintain their good record.      SMALL INDEPENDENT SUBSCRIPTION LIBRARIES: \"B\" SERVICE    During the year, 832 of these libraries were linked with this Service,  compared with 801 for the previous year. Of these libraries, 253 are  served from Hamilton, 191 from Palmerston North, and 388 from  Christchurch.    Altogether 75,997 books were on loan to the 832 libraries, an average of  over 91 books per library. Over the past 10 years the average for each  library has increased from 79 books, or 15 per cent, thus demonstrating  the increasing interest that country readers are taking in the type of  books supplied by this Service. The figures shown as basic issues do not  include the thousands of books loaned to these libraries on short term  through the \"request service\".      \"C\" OR HAMPER SERVICE    In places where no library exists and where it is not possible for one  to be formed and visited by a book van, a service to properly  established groups by means of hampers is provided. During the year 45  of these groups received service, there being 3,325 books on regular  loan to them. The hamper service is also extended to six places in the  Chatham Islands and to Pitcairn Island.      LIGHTHOUSE SERVICE    The postal service has been continued to lighthouse keepers, fire  lookouts in State Forests, and a few very remote readers in coastal  islands. During the year a total of 1,851 books was issued, mostly by a  hamper service.      FREE SERVICE TO MINISTRY OF WORKS, STATE HYDRO-ELECTRIC, AND NEW ZEALAND  FOREST SERVICE CAMPS AND STATIONS    During the year 54 camps or stations received visits from the book van,  in addition to one receiving hamper service from the Christchurch  office. Altogether 7,691 books are on loan to such places.      HOSPITAL AND INSTITUTIONAL SERVICE    Visits have continued from the book vans to 12 general hospitals with an  exchange of 1,405 books. Twelve mental hospitals received 3,910 books  and 13 prisons 3,125 books. During the year assistance has been given to  the Department of Justice in book and periodical selection.    Difficulties occur from time to time in connection with the service to  prisons and mental hospitals. They arise from the lack of supervision of  these libraries by trained library staff. Officers engaged in other  duties are not in a position to organise the full service which would be  of such benefit to patients and prisoners.    From the special TB collection 1,620 books were exchanged at  four-monthly intervals for 15 sanatoria and tuberculosis wards of public  hospitals. Three hundred and thirteen books were sent on request (250  non-fiction and 63 fiction). Sixty-four requests could not be fulfilled  as the required books were not available through the stock or through  purchase, and the resources of other collections are not used for these  borrowers.      LOAN COLLECTIONS    Collections of books, pamphlets, and periodicals to illustrate  particular subjects are available for short periods not only to  affiliated libraries but also to university and the larger public  libraries.      USE OF LOAN COLLECTIONS                                  Year ended 31 March                                   1957      1958    Number of collections sent        628       640  Number of books included       26,667    26,645      PERIODICALS SERVICE    A total of 1,127 titles is now taken by the Wellington office, of which  821 copies are circulated regularly to Government Department libraries.  Four hundred and eighty copies are sent direct from the publishers to  the Country Library Service offices in Hamilton, Palmerston North, and  Christchurch, and are sent out regularly to 93 affiliated libraries. In  addition, the periodicals held in Wellington are available on short-term  loan to public and other libraries which are interested in them.          SECTION II--SCHOOL LIBRARY SERVICE      In 1941 the Minister of Education approved the establishment of a New  Zealand School Library Service, the purchasing of books to be financed  from the augmented item \"School and Class Libraries\" in the vote  \"Education\", the administration being undertaken by the Country Library  Service, as it then was. This new service was to provide not school text  books, but a wide and varied choice of books of high imaginative quality  or technical excellence, suitable for children at all levels of ability  and stages of development. The smaller and more remote country schools  were to be given priority. Books were to be freely available for reading  at home.    The provision of supplies of books which circulate among schools goes  some way towards setting free the money for library books, available to  schools by way of annual capitation grant and from local contribution,  which is eligible for subsidy. These funds may then be used to build at  each school (a) a collection of such basic reference books as are needed  always at hand; (b) reading material for the preparatory classes; (c)  books of purely local interest; (d) other books which it is desired to  have permanently.    By cooperation between the Education Board and the Dunedin City Council  considerable progress had been made in service to schools in Otago since  1938. Vigorous exploitation of a book stock selected in terms of  children's interests followed the most enlightened overseas practice,  linking skilfully the activities of home, school, and public library, as  well as introducing to this country books not previously known here.    Beginning in Canterbury in March 1942 by incorporating the Travelling  Library for Rural Schools, the School Library Service has developed  until, today, exchanges of books are sent to 2,490 schools with a total  roll (excluding primers) of 298,317. These figures do not include those  for post-primary schools, which make use of the information and request  service only.    Services available to schools and to the smaller public libraries can be  broadly defined as general exchanges of books, information and request  service, provision of book lists, and advice on library planning.    General exchanges of books, changed regularly, are sent to all primary,  intermediate, and district high schools and the primary departments of  registered private schools which join the service, for the use of pupils  in Standard 1 and upwards. These books are intended mainly for  recreational reading, both at home and at school. The number sent in  each exchange is based on the school roll, exclusive of primer classes,  on a scale of not fewer than one per child, while for small schools it  is usually possible to increase this to two or three books per child.  Exchanges are made at least once a year, with further exchanges during  the year for smaller schools to the extent that books and staff make  possible. Where satisfactory arrangements for storage and adequate use  can be made, exchanges of suitable books are also sent to the smaller  public libraries which provide free service in their children's and  young adults' sections. The number of books sent is based on the  population of the area controlled by the local authority. Post-primary  schools depending, as they do, mainly on their own libraries, do not  receive exchanges of books but"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1980"],[0,"Stories (#3)"],[1," Tom produced his packet, and solemnly untied the handkerchiefs which  enveloped it. \"There!\" he said, putting his crystal on the table; \"what  would you say was a fair price for that?\"    Madison took it up and examined it critically. \"Well,\" he said, laying  it down again, \"in its crude state about twelve shillings per ton.\"    \"Twelve shillings!\" cried Tom, starting to his feet. \"Don't you see what  it is?\"    \"Rock-salt!\"    \"Rock-salt be d--d! a diamond.\"    \"Taste it!\" said Madison.    Tom put it to his lips, dashed it down with a dreadful exclamation, and  rushed out of the room.    I felt sad and disappointed enough myself; but presently, remembering  what Tom had said about the pistol, I, too left the house, and made for  the hut, leaving Madison open-mouthed with astonishment. When I got in,  I found Tom lying in his bunk with his face to the wall, too dispirited  apparently to answer my consolations. Anathematising Dick and Madison,  the Sasassa demon, and everything else, I strolled out of the hut, and  refreshed myself with a pipe after our wearisome adventure. I was about  fifty yards from the hut, when I heard issuing from it the sound which  of all others I least expected to hear. Had it been a groan or an oath,  I should have taken it as a matter of course; but the sound which  caused me to stop and take the pipe out of my mouth was a hearty roar of  laughter! Next moment Tom himself emerged from the door, his whole face  radiant with delight. \"Game for another ten-mile walk, old fellow?\"    \"What! for another lump of rock-salt, at twelve shillings a ton?\"    \"'No more of that, Hal, an you love me,' \" grinned Tom. \"Now look here,  Jack. What blessed fools we are to be so floored by a trifle! Just sit  on this stump for five minutes, and I'll make it as clear as daylight.  You've seen many a lump of rock-salt stuck in a crag, and so have I,  though we did make such a mull of this one. Now, Jack, did any of  the pieces you have ever seen shine in the darkness brighter than any  fire-fly?\"    \"Well, I can't say they ever did.\"    \"I'd venture to prophesy that if we waited until night, which we won't  do, we would see that light still glimmering among the rocks. Therefore,  Jack, when we took away this worthless salt, we took the wrong crystal.  It is no very strange thing in these hills that a piece of rock-salt  should be lying within a foot of a diamond. It caught our eyes, and  we were excited, and so we made fools of ourselves, and _left the real  stone behind_. Depend upon it, Jack, the Sasassa gem is lying within  that magic circle of chalk upon the face of yonder cliff. Come, old  fellow, light your pipe and stow your revolver, and we'll be off before  that fellow Madison has time to put two and two together.\"    I don't know that I was very sanguine this time. I had begun, in fact,  to look upon the diamond as a most unmitigated nuisance. However, rather  than throw a damper on Tom's expectations, I announced myself eager to  start. What a walk it was! Tom was always a good mountaineer, but his  excitement seemed to lend him wings that day, while I scrambled along  after him as best I could.    When we got within half a mile he broke into the \"double,\" and never  pulled up until he reached the round white circle upon the cliff. Poor  old Tom! when I came up, his mood had changed, and he was standing  with his hands in his pockets, gazing vacantly before him with a rueful  countenance.    \"Look!\" he said, \"look!\" and he pointed at the cliff. Not a sign of  anything in the least resembling a diamond there. The circle included  nothing but a flat slate-coloured stone, with one large hole, where we  had extracted the rock-salt, and one or two smaller depressions. No sign  of the gem.    \"I've been over every inch of it,\" said poor Tom. \"It's not there. Some  one has been here and noticed the chalk, and taken it. Come home, Jack;  I feel sick and tired. Oh, had any man ever luck like mine!\"    I turned to go, but took one last look at the cliff first. Tom was  already ten paces off.    \"Hollo!\" I cried, \"don't you see any change in that circle since  yesterday?\"    \"What d' ye mean?\" said Tom.    \"Don't you miss a thing that was there before?\"    \"The rock-salt?\" said Tom.    \"No; but the little round knob that we used for a fulcrum. I suppose we  must have wrenched it off in using the lever. Let's have a look at what  it's made of.\"    Accordingly, at the foot of the cliff we searched about among the loose  stones.    \"Here you are, Jack! We've done it at last! We're made men!\"    I turned round, and there was Tom radiant with delight, and with the  little corner of black rock in his hand. At first sight it seemed to  be merely a chip from the cliff; but near the base there was projecting  from it an object which Tom was now exultingly pointing out. It  looked at first something like a glass eye; but there was a depth and  brilliancy about it such as glass never exhibited. There was no mistake  this time; we had certainly got possession of a jewel of great value;  and with light hearts we turned from the valley, bearing away with us  the \"fiend\" which had so long reigned there.    There, sir; I've spun my story out too long, and tired you perhaps.  You see, when I get talking of those rough old days, I kind of see the  little cabin again, and the brook beside it, and the bush around, and  seem to hear Tom's honest voice once more. There's little for me to say  now. We prospered on the gem. Tom Donahue, as you know, has set up  here, and is well known about town. I have done well, farming and  ostrich-raising in Africa. We set old Dick Wharton up in business, and  he is one of our nearest neighbours. If you should ever be coming up our  way, sir, you'll not forget to ask for Jack Turnbull--Jack Turnbull of  Sasassa Farm.          LONG ODDS, By H. Rider Haggard      The story which is narrated in the following pages came to me from the  lips of my old friend Allan Quatermain, or Hunter Quatermain, as we used  to call him in South Africa. He told it to me one evening when I was  stopping with him at the place he bought in Yorkshire. Shortly after  that, the death of his only son so unsettled him that he immediately  left England, accompanied by two companions, his old fellow-voyagers,  Sir Henry Curtis and Captain Good, and has now utterly vanished into the  dark heart of Africa. He is persuaded that a white people, of which he  has heard rumours all his life, exists somewhere on the highlands in the  vast, still unexplored interior, and his great ambition is to find them  before he dies. This is the wild quest upon which he and his companions  have departed, and from which I shrewdly suspect they never will return.  One letter only have I received from the old gentleman, dated from a  mission station high up the Tana, a river on the east coast, about  three hundred miles north of Zanzibar; in it he says that they have gone  through many hardships and adventures, but are alive and well, and have  found traces which go far toward making him hope that the results of  their wild quest may be a \"magnificent and unexampled discovery.\" I  greatly fear, however, that all he has discovered is death; for this  letter came a long while ago, and nobody has heard a single word of the  party since. They have totally vanished.    It was on the last evening of my stay at his house that he told the  ensuing story to me and Captain Good, who was dining with him. He had  eaten his dinner and drunk two or three glasses of old port, just to  help Good and myself to the end of the second bottle. It was an unusual  thing for him to do, for he was a most abstemious man, having conceived,  as he used to say, a great horror of drink from observing its  effects upon the class of colonists--hunters, transport-riders  and others--amongst whom he had passed so many years of his life.  Consequently the good wine took more effect on him than it would have  done on most men, sending a little flush into his wrinkled cheeks, and  making him talk more freely than usual.    Dear old man! I can see him now, as he went limping up and down the  vestibule, with his gray hair sticking up in scrubbing-brush fashion,  his shrivelled yellow face, and his large dark eyes, that were as keen  as any hawk's, and yet soft as a buck's. The whole room was hung with  trophies of his numerous hunting expeditions, and he had some story  about every one of them, if only he could be got to tell it. Generally  he would not, for he was not very fond of narrating his own adventures,  but to-night the port wine made him more communicative.    \"Ah, you brute!\" he said, stopping beneath an unusually large skull of  a lion, which was fixed just over the mantelpiece, beneath a long row of  guns, its jaws distended to their utmost width. \"Ah, you brute! you have  given me a lot of trouble for the last dozen years, and will, I suppose  to my dying day.\"    \"Tell us the yarn, Quatermain,\" said Good. \"You have often promised to  tell me, and you never have.\"    \"You had better not ask me to,\" he answered, \"for it is a longish one.\"    \"All right,\" I said, \"the evening is young, and there is some more  port.\"    Thus adjured, he filled his pipe from a jar of coarse-cut Boer tobacco  that was always standing on the mantelpiece, and still walking up and  down the room, began:    \"It was, I think, in the March of '69 that I was up in Sikukuni's  country. It was just after old Sequati's time, and Sikukuni had got into  power--I forget how. Anyway, I was there. I had heard that the Bapedi  people had brought down an enormous quantity of ivory from the interior,  and so I started with a waggon-load of goods, and came straight away  from Middelburg to try and trade some of it. It was a risky thing to  go into the country so early, on account of the fever; but I knew that  there were one or two others after that lot of ivory, so I determined  to have a try for it, and"]]]
