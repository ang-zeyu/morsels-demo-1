Therefore, as faith perfects the intellect, whereas  hope and charity perfect the appetitive part, the comparison between  them fails.    Nevertheless neither can anything false come under hope, for a man  hopes to obtain eternal life, not by his own power (since this would  be an act of presumption), but with the help of grace; and if he  perseveres therein he will obtain eternal life surely and infallibly.    In like manner it belongs to charity to love God, wherever He may be;  so that it matters not to charity, whether God be in the individual  whom we love for God's sake.    Reply Obj. 2: That \"God would not take flesh,\" considered in itself  was possible even after Abraham's time, but in so far as it stands in  God's foreknowledge, it has a certain necessity of infallibility, as  explained in the First Part (Q. 14, AA. 13, 15): and it is thus that  it comes under faith. Hence in so far as it comes under faith, it  cannot be false.    Reply Obj. 3: After Christ's birth, to believe in Him, was to believe  in Christ's birth at some time or other. The fixing of the time,  wherein some were deceived was not due to their faith, but to a human  conjecture. For it is possible for a believer to have a false opinion  through a human conjecture, but it is quite impossible for a false  opinion to be the outcome of faith.    Reply Obj. 4: The faith of the believer is not directed to such and  such accidents of bread, but to the fact that the true body of Christ  is under the appearances of sensible bread, when it is rightly  consecrated. Hence if it be not rightly consecrated, it does not  follow that anything false comes under faith.  _______________________    FOURTH ARTICLE [II-II, Q. 1, Art. 4]    Whether the Object of Faith Can Be Something Seen?    Objection 1: It would seem that the object of faith is something  seen. For Our Lord said to Thomas (John 20:29): \"Because thou hast  seen Me, Thomas, thou hast believed.\" Therefore vision and faith  regard the same object.    Obj. 2: Further, the Apostle, while speaking of the knowledge of  faith, says (1 Cor. 13:12): \"We see now through a glass in a dark  manner.\" Therefore what is believed is seen.    Obj. 3: Further, faith is a spiritual light. Now something is seen  under every light. Therefore faith is of things seen.    Obj. 4: Further, \"Every sense is a kind of sight,\" as Augustine  states (De Verb. Domini, Serm. xxxiii). But faith is of things heard,  according to Rom. 10:17: \"Faith . . . cometh by hearing.\" Therefore  faith is of things seen.    _On the contrary,_ The Apostle says (Heb. 11:1) that \"faith is the  evidence of things that appear not.\"    _I answer that,_ Faith implies assent of the intellect to that which  is believed. Now the intellect assents to a thing in two ways. First,  through being moved to assent by its very object, which is known  either by itself (as in the case of first principles, which are held  by the habit of understanding), or through something else already  known (as in the case of conclusions which are held by the habit of  science). Secondly the intellect assents to something, not through  being sufficiently moved to this assent by its proper object, but  through an act of choice, whereby it turns voluntarily to one side  rather than to the other: and if this be accompanied by doubt or fear  of the opposite side, there will be opinion, while, if there be  certainty and no fear of the other side, there will be faith.    Now those things are said to be seen which, of themselves, move the  intellect or the senses to knowledge of them. Wherefore it is evident  that neither faith nor opinion can be of things seen either by the  senses or by the intellect.    Reply Obj. 1: Thomas \"saw one thing, and believed another\" [*St.  Gregory: Hom. xxvi in Evang.]: he saw the Man, and believing Him to  be God, he made profession of his faith, saying: \"My Lord and my God.\"    Reply Obj. 2: Those things which come under faith can be considered  in two ways. First, in particular; and thus they cannot be seen and  believed at the same time, as shown above. Secondly, in general, that  is, under the common aspect of credibility; and in this way they are  seen by the believer. For he would not believe unless, on the  evidence of signs, or of something similar, he saw that they ought to  be believed.    Reply Obj. 3: The light of faith makes us see what we believe. For  just as, by the habits of the other virtues, man sees what is  becoming to him in respect of that habit, so, by the habit of faith,  the human mind is directed to assent to such things as are becoming  to a right faith, and not to assent to others.    Reply Obj. 4: Hearing is of words signifying what is of faith, but  not of the things themselves that are believed; hence it does not  follow that these things are seen.  _______________________    FIFTH ARTICLE [II-II, Q. 1, Art. 5]    Whether Those Things That Are of Faith Can Be an Object of Science  [*Science is certain knowledge of a demonstrated conclusion through  its demonstration]?    Objection 1: It would seem that those things that are of faith can be  an object of science. For where science is lacking there is  ignorance, since ignorance is the opposite of science. Now we are not  in ignorance of those things we have to believe, since ignorance of  such things savors of unbelief, according to 1 Tim. 1:13: \"I did it  ignorantly in unbelief.\" Therefore things that are of faith can be an  object of science.    Obj. 2: Further, science is acquired by reasons. Now sacred writers  employ reasons to inculcate things that are of faith. Therefore such  things can be an object of science.    Obj. 3: Further, things which are demonstrated are an object of  science, since a \"demonstration is a syllogism that produces  science.\" Now certain matters of faith have been demonstrated by the  philosophers, such as the Existence and Unity of God, and so forth.  Therefore things that are of faith can be an object of science.    Obj. 4: Further, opinion is further from science than faith is, since  faith is said to stand between opinion and science. Now opinion and  science can, in a way, be about the same object, as stated in Poster.  i. Therefore faith and science can be about the same object also.    _On the contrary,_ Gregory says (Hom. xxvi in Evang.) that \"when a  thing is manifest, it is the object, not of faith, but of  perception.\" Therefore things that are of faith are not the object of  perception, whereas what is an object of science is the object of  perception. Therefore there can be no faith about things which are an  object of science.    _I answer that,_ All science is derived from self-evident and  therefore \"seen\" principles; wherefore all objects of science must  needs be, in a fashion, seen.    Now as stated above (A. 4), it is impossible that one and the same  thing should be believed and seen by the same person. Hence it is  equally impossible for one and the same thing to be an object of  science and of belief for the same person. It may happen, however,  that a thing which is an object of vision or science for one, is  believed by another: since we hope to see some day what we now  believe about the Trinity, according to 1 Cor. 13:12: \"We see now  through a glass in a dark manner; but then face to face\": which  vision the angels possess already; so that what we believe, they see.  In like manner it may happen that what is an object of vision or  scientific knowledge for one man, even in the state of a wayfarer,  is, for another man, an object of faith, because he does not know it  by demonstration.    Nevertheless that which is proposed to be believed equally by all, is  equally unknown by all as an object of science: such are the things  which are of faith simply. Consequently faith and science are not  about the same things.    Reply Obj. 1: Unbelievers are in ignorance of things that are of  faith, for neither do they see or know them in themselves, nor do  they know them to be credible. The faithful, on the other hand, know  them, not as by demonstration, but by the light of faith which makes  them see that they ought to believe them, as stated above (A. 4, ad  2, 3).    Reply Obj. 2: The reasons employed by holy men to prove things that  are of faith, are not demonstrations; they are either persuasive  arguments showing that what is proposed to our faith is not  impossible, or else they are proofs drawn from the principles of  faith, i.e. from the authority of Holy Writ, as Dionysius declares  (Div. Nom. ii). Whatever is based on these principles is as well  proved in the eyes of the faithful, as a conclusion drawn from  self-evident principles is in the eyes of all. Hence again, theology  is a science, as we stated at the outset of this work (P. I, Q. 1, A. 2).    Reply Obj. 3: Things which can be proved by demonstration are  reckoned among the articles of faith, not because they are believed  simply by all, but because they are a necessary presupposition to  matters of faith, so that those who do not known them by  demonstration must know them first of all by faith.    Reply Obj. 4: As the Philosopher says (Poster. i), \"science and  opinion about the same object can certainly be in different men,\" as  we have stated above about science and faith; yet it is possible for  one and the same man to have science and faith about the same thing  relatively, i.e. in relation to the object, but not in the same  respect. For it is possible for the same person, about one and the  same object, to know one thing and to think another: and, in like  manner, one may know by demonstration the unity of the Godhead, and,  by faith, the Trinity. On the other hand, in one and the same man,  about the same object, and in the same respect, science is  incompatible with either opinion or faith, yet for different reasons.  Because science is incompatible with opinion about the same"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18757"],[0,"Prince Henry the Navigator, the Hero of Portugal and of Modern Discovery, (#3)"],[1,"Greek, in his  edition of Abulfeda, Paris, 1848; (2) Sprenger's Massoudy, 1841; (3)  Edrisi, translated by Amedee Jaubert; (4) Ibn-Batuta (abridgment),  translated by S.

The three modern lives of Prince Henry which I have chiefly consulted  are:    R.H. Major's _Henry the Navigator_, Wappaeus' _Heinrich der Seeffahrer_,  and De Weer's _Prinz Heinrich_, with O. Martins' _Lives of the Infants  of the House of Aviz_ in his _Sons of Don John I._    The maps and illustrations have been planned in a regular series.    I. As to the former, they are meant to show in an historical succession  the course of geographical advance in Christendom down to the death of  Prince Henry (1460). Setting aside the Ptolemy, which represents the  knowledge of the world at its height in the pre-Christian civilisation,  and the Edrisi which represents the Arabic followers of Ptolemy, whose  influence upon early Christian geography was very marked, all the maps  reproduced belong to the science of the Christian ages and countries.  The two Mappe-mondes above referred to are both placed in the  introductory chapter, and are treated only as the most important  examples of the science which the Graeco-Roman Empire bequeathed to  Christendom, but which between the seventh and thirteenth centuries was  chiefly worked upon by the Arabs. Among early Christian maps, that of  St. Sever, possibly of the eighth century, the Anglo-Saxon map of the  tenth century, the Turin Map of the eleventh, and the Spanish map of the  twelfth (1109), represent very crude and simple types of sketches of the  world, in which within a square or oblong surrounded by the ocean a few  prominent features only, such as the main divisions of countries, are  attempted. The Anglo-Saxon example, though greatly superior to the  others given here, essentially belongs to this kind of work, where some  little truth is preserved by a happy ignorance of the travellers' tales  that came into fashion later, but where there is only the vaguest and  most general knowledge of geographical facts.    On the other hand, in the next group, to which the Psalter map is  allied, and in which the Hereford map is our best example, mythical  learning--drawn from books like Pliny, Solinus, St. Isidore, and  Martianus Capella, which collected stories of beasts and monsters,  stones and men, divine, human, and natural marvels on the principle  _Credo quia impossible_--has overpowered every other consideration, and  a map of the world becomes a great picture-book of curious objects, in  which the very central and primary interest of geography is lost. But by  the side of and almost at the same time as these specimens of  geographical mythology, geographical science had taken a new start in  the coast charts or portolani of Balearic and Italian seamen, some  specimens of which form our next set of maps.    Dulcert's portolano of 1339 and the Laurentian of 1351 are two of the  best examples of this kind of work, which gave us our first really  accurate map of any part of the globe, but which for some time was  entirely confined to coast drawing, and was meant to supply the  practical wants of captains, pilots, and seamen. The Catalan atlas of  1375-6 shows the portolano type extended to a real Mappa Mundi; the  elaborate carefulness and sumptuousness of this example prepares us for  the still higher work of Andrea Bianco and of Benincasa in the fifteenth  century. As the Laurentian portolano of 1351 commemorates the voyage of  1341 and marks its discoveries in the Atlantic islands, so the Catalan  map of 1375-6 commemorates the Catalan voyage of 1346, and gives the  best and most up-to-date picture of the N.W. African coast as it was  known before Prince Henry's discoveries.    Last of these groups of maps is that of examples from Henry's own age,  such as the Fra Mauro map of 1459 or the maps of Andrea Bianco and  Benincasa (_e.g._, 1436, 1448, 1468), among which the first-named is the  only one we have been able to give here.    The Borgian map of 1450 is given as an extraordinary specimen of what  could be done as late as 1450, not as an example of geographical  progress; and the map of 1492, recording Portuguese discoveries down to  the rounding of the Cape of Good Hope, is added to illustrate the  advance of explorers in the years closely following Henry's death, as it  was realised at the time.    The maps have in most cases been set from the modern standpoint, but, as  will readily be seen by the position of the names, the normal mediaeval  setting was quite different, with the S. or E. at the top.    II. The illustrations aim at giving portraits or pictures of the chief  persons and places connected with the life of Prince Henry. There are  three of the Prince himself; one from the Paris MS. of Azurara, one from  the gateway of the great convent church of Belem, one from the recumbent  statue over his tomb at Batalha. Two others give: (1) The whole group of  the royal tombs of Henry's house,--of his father, mother, and brothers  in the aisle at Batalha, and (2) the recumbent statues of his father and  mother, John and Philippa, in detail; the exterior and general effect of  the same church--Portugal's Westminster, and the mausoleum of the  Navigator's own family of Aviz--comes next, in a view of this greatest  of Portuguese shrines.    Coimbra University, with which as rector or chancellor or patron Prince  Henry was so closely connected, for which he once provided house room,  and in which his benefactions earned him the title of \"Protector of the  studies of Portugal\" is given to illustrate his life as a student and a  man of science; the mother church of the order of Christ at Thomar may  remind us of another side of his life--as a military monk, grand master  of an order of religious chivalry which at least professed to bind its  members to a single life, and which under his lead took an active part  in the exploration and settlement of the African coasts and the Atlantic  islands.    The portraits of Columbus, Da Gama, and Albuquerque, which conclude this  set of illustrations, are given as portraits of three of Prince Henry's  more or less conscious disciples and followers, of three men who did  most to realise his schemes. The first of these, who owed to Portuguese  advance towards the south the suggestion of corresponding success in the  west, and who found America by the western"]]]
