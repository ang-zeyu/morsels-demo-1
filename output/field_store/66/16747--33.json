The nominal value of the pieces might be a little more than the       real, to prevent their being melted down, but not so much more as       to be an encouragement of counterfeiting.     I am, etc.,                                               B. FRANKLIN.    The Academy of Inscriptions and Belles-Lettres \"entered on the     (p. xvi)  discussion with the same alacrity as if the subject had been designed  to illustrate the actions of their compatriots, or to immortalize some  glorious events in the annals of their own nation.\"[3] Commissioners,  consisting of four of its members, were at once appointed to suggest  designs for the three medals asked for Generals Washington, Gates, and  Greene.[4]                       [Footnote 3: See A, page xxxiv.]                       [Footnote 4: See B, page xxxvi.]    Through the courtesy of M. Narcisse Dupre, son of Augustin Dupre, I am  enabled to give the contract between his father and Colonel Humphreys  for the engraving of the medal for General Greene:[5]                       [Footnote 5: For the French original see C, page                     xli.]         I, the undersigned, Augustin Dupre, engraver of medals and       medallist of the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture, bind       myself to Colonel Humphreys to engrave the medal representing the       portrait of General Greene. On the reverse, Victory treading       under her feet broken arms, with the legend and the exergue, and       I hold myself responsible for any breakage of the dies up to       twenty-four medals, and bind myself to furnish one at my own       expense (the diameter of the medal to be twenty-four _lignes_).         All on the following conditions: That for the two engraved dies       of the said medal shall be paid me the sum of two thousand four       hundred _livres_, on delivery of the two dies after the       twenty-four medals which the Colonel desires have been struck.         Done in duplicate between us, in Paris, this nineteenth of       November, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-five (1785).                                                 D. HUMPHREYS.                                               DUPRE.    On November 25th of the same year, M. Dacier, the perpetual secretary  of the Academy of Inscriptions and Belles-Lettres, communicated another  letter from Colonel Humphreys, in which he requested the Academy to  compose designs for three more medals, which had been voted to  General Morgan and to Lieutenant-Colonels Washington and Howard.  (p. xvii)  Commissioners were appointed and designs made for these also.[6]                       [Footnote 6: See B, page xxxvi.]    Colonel Humphreys having returned to America before the medals were  finished, their superintendence was undertaken by Mr. Jefferson, as  will be seen from the following letter:         To the Honourable          John JAY,                            Paris, February 14, 1787.               Secretary for Foreign Affairs.         Sir: Mr. Morris, during his office, being authorized to have the       medals and swords executed, which had been ordered by Congress,       he authorized Colonel Humphreys to take measures here for the       execution. Colonel Humphreys did so, and the swords were finished       in time for him to carry them. The medals not being finished, he       desired me to attend to them. The workman who was to make that of       General Greene brought me yesterday the medal in gold,       twenty-three in copper, and the die. Mr. Short, during my       absence, will avail himself of the first occasion which shall       offer of forwarding the medals to you. I must beg leave, through       you, to ask the pleasure of Congress as to the number they would       choose to have struck. Perhaps they might be willing to deposit       one of each person in every college of the United States. Perhaps       they might choose to give a series of them to each of the crowned       heads of Europe, which would be an acceptable present to them.       They will be pleased to decide. In the meantime I have sealed up       the die, and shall retain it till I am honoured with their orders       as to this medal, and the others also, when they shall be       finished.                   With great respect and esteem,                                               Th: JEFFERSON.    In another letter to Mr. Jay, dated Marseilles, May 4, 1787, Mr.  Jefferson again refers to this subject:           -       -       -       -       -         I am in hopes Mr. Short will be able to send you the medals of       General Gates by this packet. I await a general instruction as to       these medals. The academies of Europe will be much pleased to       receive a set.            -       -       -       -       -    Mr. Jefferson's communication of the 14th of February was        (p. xviii)  brought to the notice of Congress by Mr. Jay, and was referred back to  him by Congress. The result was the following report:                                                 OFFICE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS,                                                      July 11, 1787.         The Secretary of the United States for the Department of Foreign       Affairs, to whom was referred a letter from the Honourable Mr.       Jefferson of the 14th of February last,         _Reports_, Your secretary presumes that the following paragraphs       in this letter occasion its being referred to him, viz.: \"The       workman who was to make a medal of General Greene brought me       yesterday the medal in gold, twenty-three in copper, and the die.       I must beg leave, through you, to ask the pleasure of Congress as       to the number they would choose to have struck. Perhaps they       might be willing to deposit one of each person in every college       of the United States. Perhaps they might choose to give a series       of them to each of the crowned heads of Europe, which would be an       acceptable present to them. They will be pleased to decide. In       the meantime I have sealed up the die, and shall retain it till I       am honoured with their orders as to this medal, and the others       also, when they shall be finished.\"         As these medals were directed to be struck in order to signalize       and commemorate certain interesting events and conspicuous       characters, the distribution of them should in his opinion be       such as may best conduce to that end. He therefore thinks that       both of Mr. Jefferson's hints should be improved, to wit, that a       series of these medals should be presented to each of the crowned       heads in Europe, and that one of each set be deposited in each of       the American colleges. He presumes that Mr. Jefferson does not       mean that any should be presented to the King of Great Britain,       for it would not be delicate; nor that by crowned heads he meant       to exclude free states from the compliment, for to make       discriminations would give offense.         In the judgment of your secretary it would be proper to instruct       Mr. Jefferson to present in the name of the United States one       silver medal of each denomination to every monarch (except His       Britannic Majesty), and to every sovereign and independent state       without exception in Europe; and also to the Emperor of Morocco.       That he also be instructed to send fifteen silver medals of each       set to Congress, to be by them presented to the thirteen      (p. xix)       United States respectively, and also to the Emperor of China with       an explanation and a letter, and one to General Washington.       That he also be instructed to present a copper medal of each       denomination to each of the most distinguished universities       (except the British) in Europe, and also to Count de Rochambeau,       to Count d'Estaing, and to Count de Grasse; and, lastly, that he       be instructed to send to Congress two hundred copper ones of each       set, together with the dies.         Your secretary thinks that of these it would be proper to present       one to each of the American colleges, one to the Marquis de la       Fayette, and one to each of the other major-generals who served       in the late American army; and that the residue with the dies be       deposited in the Secretary's Office of the United States, subject       to such future orders as Congress may think proper to make       respecting them.         It might be more magnificent to give gold medals to sovereigns,       silver ones to distinguished persons, and copper ones to the       colleges; but, in his opinion, the nature of the American       Governments, as well as the state of their finance, will       apologize for their declining the expense.         All which is submitted to the wisdom of Congress.                                                 John JAY.    The records of the Academy of Inscriptions and Belles-Lettres show  that in 1789, at the request of Mr. Jefferson, it also composed  designs for the medals awarded by Congress to General Wayne, Major  Stewart, and Captain John Paul Jones.[7] Mr. Jefferson had previously  had an interview with M. Augustin Dupre on the subject, as will be  seen by the following note, the original of which is in Mr.  Jefferson's handwriting:[8]                       [Footnote 7: See D, page xli.]                       [Footnote 8: For the French originals of this and                     the following letter, see E, page xliv.]        To        M. DUPRE,           Engraver of Medals and Medallist of the               Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture.         Mr. Jefferson having received orders concerning medals to be       struck would like to talk about them with M. Dupre, if he will       please do him the honour to call on him to-morrow morning"]]]
