They were the sons of  one Anderson Rover, who, when not traveling, made his home at Valley  Brook Farm, in New York State, living there with his brother Randolph  Rover and wife Martha.    While Dick, Tom, and Sam were quite young, and while their father was  off exploring in the interior of Africa, the three Rovers had been sent  to Putnam Hall Military Academy, where they had made a few enemies and  likewise a host of friends, including a manly and straight-forward  cadet named Lawrence Colby. After many adventures both at school and in  various portions of the globe, they had graduated from Putnam Hall with  honor and then entered Brill College.    At that time, Mr. Anderson Rover, who had long since returned from  Africa, was not in the best of health. He had numerous business  interests both in Wall Street, New York City, and in the West to take  care of, and presently it was found necessary that Dick leave college  and take charge of business matters for his parent. In this task Dick  was soon aided by Tom, leaving Sam the only member of the family to  graduate from Brill.    While at Putnam Hall the three Rovers had become acquainted with three  charming girls, Dora Stanhope and her cousins, Nellie and Grace Laning.  This acquaintance had ripened into loving intimacy; and when Dick went  into business he took Dora Stanhope for his life-long partner. A little  later Tom was married to Nellie Laning, and, after he had left Brill  and joined his brothers in conducting their father's various business  enterprises, Sam married Grace Laning.    With the aid of Mr. Anderson Rover and some others, The Rover Company  was organized with offices on Wall Street, New York City. The company  dealt in stocks, bonds, real estate, and other investments; and Dick  was now president, with Tom secretary and Sam treasurer. The company  had been prosperous from the start, although on several occasions  enemies had done their best to give the concern a black eye.    When they were first married, Dick and his beautiful wife Dora had  begun housekeeping in a cosy apartment in the metropolis, and they had  presently been followed by Tom and Sam. But two years later the three  brothers had a chance to buy a beautiful plot of ground on Riverside  Drive facing the noble Hudson River, and on this they built three fine  houses adjoining each other, Dick living in the middle house with Tom  on one side and Sam on the other.    Before the happy young folks moved into the new homes, Dick and Dora  were blessed with a little son, who later on was named John, after Mr.  John Laning. Later still, this couple had a daughter, whom they named  Martha, after Aunt Martha of Valley Brook Farm. Little Jack, as he was  called in those days, was a wonderfully bright and clever lad with many  of the clear-minded qualities which had made his father so successful  in life.    About the time young Jack was presented with a baby sister, Tom and  Nellie Rover came forward with twin boys, one of whom was named  Anderson, after his grandfather, and the other Randolph, after his  uncle. Andy and Randy, as they were always called for short, were  exceedingly bright, each taking after his father, Andy always saying  things that were more or less funny and Randy playing tricks whenever  he got the chance. They were truly chips off the old block, and Tom  knew it, although outwardly he professed to be ignorant of the fact.    \"Those twins will be some boys when they grow up,\" was old Anderson  Rover's comment, when the lads were less than five years old. \"They're  just as full of fun now as Tom ever dared to be.\"    \"So they are,\" answered his brother Randolph. \"My! my! what will they  ever do with them when they get a little older?\"    \"I sha'n't mind,\" said Aunt Martha, her eyes beaming brightly. \"That  is, if they are really and truly as good-hearted as Tom has always  been. He certainly was the worst of the lot when it came to playing  jokes, but no lad ever had a better heart than Tom--not one!\"    About the time that Tom began to boast about his twins, Sam and Grace  came along with a beautiful little girl, whom they named Mary, after  Mrs. Laning. About a year later the girl was followed by a boy, and  this sturdy little chap was named Fred, after Sam's old school chum,  Fred Garrison.    Living so close together, the four boys and the two girls were brought  up almost like one big family. The girls were all but inseparable, and  the boys could generally be found together, either studying, playing,  or having a good time.    When the time came to set the children to studying, Martha and Mary  were placed in a private school for girls located but a short distance  from their homes. It was thought best, however, at the start to send  the boys to a public school, and this was done. For three years matters  went along very well, and during that time The Rover Company prospered  far beyond the expectations of those in charge. But then Andy and  Randy, becoming a little older, began to exhibit their talent for  playing tricks, and usually they were seconded in these efforts by Jack  and Fred. Once or twice all of the boys were reported by the school  principal for this, and each time the lads were remonstrated with by  their fathers in such a manner that, as young Andy expressed it, \"it  was far more comfortable to sit down standing up than it was any other  way.\"    \"I think I'll have to do something with those twins,\" said Tom Rover to  his wife, after the boys had been reported for more tricks. \"The school  they go to doesn't seem to be strict enough.\" And thereupon he had sent  the boys to a private establishment further uptown.    Jack and Fred had begged their parents that they might be allowed to do  likewise; and at this private school the four cousins had been kept  until the close of the Spring term the preceding June. To the credit of  this school it must be said that the boys advanced rapidly in their  studies. Their deportment, however, was apparently no better than it  had been before, and as a consequence Tom Rover was more worried than  ever, while Dick and Sam began to wonder secretly whether it would not  be advisable to separate their sons from the mischievous twins.    One day Dick broached this subject to his offspring. At once young Jack  set up a wild remonstrance.    \"Oh, Dad! don't take me away from Andy and Randy and Fred!\" he pleaded.  \"Why, we are just like brothers! I wouldn't know how to get along  without 'em.\"    \"But I'm afraid Andy and Randy are leading you into bad habits,\"  returned Dick Rover.    \"I don't think so, Dad. Anyway, I've heard folks say that Andy and  Randy are no worse than their father used to be--and you never wanted  to be separated from Uncle Tom, did you?\"    At this question Dick Rover's face took on a sudden sober look. \"No; I  never wanted to be separated from your uncle, that's true,\" he said.  \"But I tell you what we did used to do. When his pranks got too wild I  and your Uncle Sam used to hold him in.\"    \"All right then, Dad. I'll tell Fred about this, and we'll see what we  can do towards holding in Andy and Randy;\" and there, after some more  talk along the same line, the matter was allowed to rest.    Young Jack was as good as his word, and during the remainder of that  Spring term at the private school in New York City, Andy and Randy were  as well behaved as could possibly be expected from two red-blooded  lads.    It had been planned by the Rovers that the Summer should be spent by  all the young folks and their mothers at Valley Brook Farm, the fathers  to come down from time to time, and especially over the week ends.  Since Dick, Tom, and Sam had become married the farm had been enlarged  by the purchase of two hundred additional acres. The farmhouse, too,  had been made larger, with the old portion remodeled, and a water  system from the rapidly-growing town of Dexter's Corners, as well as  electric lighting, had been installed. A telephone had been put in some  years previous.    At first after their arrival at their grandfather's home, the four boys  had been content to take it easy, spending their time roaming the  fields, helping to gather the fruit, of which there was great  abundance, and in going fishing and swimming. But then Andy and Randy  had found time growing a little heavy on their hands, and one prank had  been followed by another. Some of the tricks had been played on Jack  and Fred, and they, of course, had done their best to retaliate, and  this had, on more than one occasion, brought forth a forceful, but  good-natured, pitched battle, and the fathers and the others present  had had all they could do to hold the boys in check.    \"I never saw such boys,\" was Mary Rover's comment to her brother Fred.  \"Why can't you behave yourselves just as Martha and I do?\"    \"Oh, girls never have any good times,\" answered Fred. \"They just sit  around and primp up and read, and do things like that.\"    \"Indeed!\" and Mary tossed her curly head. \"I think we have just as good  times as you boys, every bit; but we don't have to be rough about it;\"  and then she ran off to play a game of lawn tennis with her cousin  Martha.    The time was the middle of August, and as the summer was proving to be  an unusually warm one, all the older Rovers were glad enough to take it  easy on the farm, they having earlier in the season been down to the  seashore for a couple of weeks. Dick, Tom and Sam had each taken a week  off at various times, and all managed to get down to the farm early  every Saturday afternoon, to remain until Sunday night or Monday  morning.    And it was late on a Saturday afternoon, when the ladies and the girls  had gone to Dexter's Corners to do some shopping, and while the fathers  were busy reading and writing, that the events occurred with which the  present story opens.    As Dick Rover ran into the farmhouse"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21899"],[0,"A Rip Van Winkle Of The Kalahari (#3)"],[1,"Anderson had given me. A trade musket, with  powder and shot, was to be the reward; and as this was a prize beyond  the dreams of these poor Bushmen there was a general exodus from the  camp in search of the \"bright stones.\" From their excited exclamations  when I showed them the diamond, I gathered that they had all seen such  stones, and I cheered myself with the hope that at last I should be  rewarded for all my hardships. But, alas! They brought in \"bright  stones\" truly bright stones in abundance but quartz crystals chiefly;  bright, clear, and sparkling, but of course utterly valueless; and  though I sent them out again and again, they brought nothing in of any  value.    Amongst my boys, who had followed me from Walfisch Bay, was one Inyati,  who was much attached to me, and who had become a sort of body-servant  to me. He was a fine upstanding chap who held himself absolutely aloof  from the Griquas and Hottentots that formed the bulk of my paid  followers, and to whose oblique eyes, and pepper-corn wool, his  expressive orbs and shock of crinkled hair formed an agreeable  contrast. As for the Bushmen, Inyati treated them, and looked upon  them, absolutely as dogs. He was a good game spoorer, and I had taught  him to shoot; and so intelligent was he, that I had taken a great  interest in him, and had learnt to talk to him in his own tongue a  sonorous, expressive language entirely different to the peculiar  \"click\" of the local natives.    I knew that his dearest wish was to possess a gun of his own, and fully  expected that he too would wish to join in the search that might lead  to his gaining one; but, though he had examined the stones I had shown  far more intently than any of them, he made no effort to leave the  camp. Day after day he attended to my simple wants, spending all his  spare time in polishing my weapons, a work he absolutely loved, and  crooning interminable songs in a low monotone.    One day, when the Bushmen had again trooped off on their fruitless  search, I called Inyati; and told him to make certain preparations, as,  should they again bring in nothing, I would strike camp and return to  Walfisch Bay. And then I asked him, out of curiosity, why he had not  tried to earn the gun.    \"Master,\" said he, scraping away at the hollow shin-bone of a buck that  served him as a pipe, as a broad hint that his tobacco was finished; \"I  know not the land of these dogs of Bushmen. If it were in my own land  now! But that is far away!\"    I laughed, for by his manner of saying it, he conveyed the impression  that there he could pick up diamonds under every bush.    \"Dogs they may be, Inyati,\" I answered him, \"but they are dogs with  keen eyes; and yet they cannot find the stones I seek, and that I know,  too, are not far away!\" He stood, nodding gravely at my words, and  still fidgeting with his bone pipe; a splendid figure of a man, nude  except for his leopard-skin loin-cloth, his skin clear and glossy, of a  golden-brown for he was no darker than, but entirely different from,  the yellow Hottentots.    \"Master,\" said he; \"what magic will my master make with the little  bright stones, should he find them?\"    \"No magic, Inyati,\" said I, \"but in my country, across the great water,  these things are worth many muskets, cattle aye, and even wives!\"    \"That may be, my master,\" he replied, \"but magic they are; and hide  themselves when dogs such as these Bushmen search for them. Still,  master, we will wait and see what they bring to-night; though well I  know that they will come back with empty hands as empty as is this my  pipe!\"    I could not help laughing at the way in which he had brought the  subject of his finished tobacco to my notice, and in a fit of unwonted  generosity I not only gave him a span of tobacco, but also a cheap pipe  from my \"trade\" goods.    Poor chap, it was the first he had ever had, for his shin-bone had  served him hitherto, and his delight was unmistakable. An hour later I  saw him still at his everlasting polishing, and with the new pipe in  full blast; and now he was crooning not only its praises, but my own.  Half his improvised song was unintelligible to me, but I understood  enough to learn that when the \"dogs of Bushmen\" had failed, he, Inyati  \"The Snake\" would lead me to a land where there were magic stones in  abundance, and by means of which, I gathered, we should both obtain  wives galore!    I laughed at the poor chap's foolish bombast, as I thought it; but I  have often wondered since whether the gift of that cheap pipe did not,  after all, alter the whole of my life.    For that evening, sure enough, the Bushmen again returned empty-handed,  and acting on my former resolve, I called my own followers together,  and told them to make ready to return to Walfisch Bay. Later, as I sat  in my tent writing up my diary by the light of a feeble candle, and  with the gloomiest of thoughts for company, I heard Inyati's voice  outside. \"Master,\" he said, in a low tone but little above a whisper,  \"the dogs are full of meat, and sleeping; and there is that which I  would show thee.\"    Without feeling much interest in what he might have got I bade him  enter, and he stood before me in the dim light of my tallow candle.    Fumbling in his leopard skin, he drew forth a little tortoiseshell,  such as the Hottentot women use for holding the hare's foot, ochre,  buchu leaves, and other mysteries of their toilet. I had often seen him  with it, and had chaffed him about carrying it before, and he evidently  anticipated something of the kind again.    \"Nay, master,\" he said, before I could speak, \"true, as thou sayest, it  is a woman's box, and a woman gave it me. But the box is naught; this  is what I would show my master.\"    He shook something from the little box into the palm of his hand,  clenched it, and with a dramatic gesture thrust it close to the dim  light, and threw his fingers wide.    There, glittering in the yellow palm, flashing and scintillating with  every movement, and looking as though the light it gathered and  reflected really burnt in its liquid depths, lay the most marvelous  diamond I had ever beheld!    The size of a small walnut, flawless, blue-tinted, and of wondrous  luster and beauty, its many facets were as brilliantly polished as  though fresh from the hands of the cutter, though it was a \"rough\"  stone, untouched except by nature.    I was too stunned to speak, or do anything but clutch it, and gloat  over it, and mutter \"Where? where?\"         CHAPTER II        DEAD MEN IN THE DUNES        I don't know how long I gazed in fascination at the wonderful stone,  but at length a low chuckle from Inyati brought me back to reality. He  stood looking at me, with a whimsical smile on his face.    \"Magic,\" said he, \"magic, my master! Did I not say there was magic in  these 'bright stones'? And who shall say it is not so? Has not my  master for a whole moon been lifeless and sad, until he looked even as  the old cow that died of lung-sick but yesterday? And has not the very  sight of the magic stone again brought fire to his eye, till he is  again even as the young bull that killed two of those Bushmen dogs also  but yesterday? Who shall say it is not magic?\"    \"Inyati,\" I stammered, coming back to my senses, and ignoring his  extremely doubtful compliments, \"speak, man; where did you get this?\"    \"In my own land, master; a far land, many moons' trek from here, and  where there are many. But few dare touch them except indeed the devil-  men and they are not men at all, but devils! Though I feared them  little even then . . . and now, now that I have a gun (for surely my  master will give me the little gun that speaks many times for this  magic stone?) I fear them not at all! And we will go back and get many  more if my master so wishes and I will see again the woman who gave me  the stone as a talisman long years ago!\"    Give him \"the little gun that speaks many times\" the Winchester for a  diamond worth a king's ransom?    \"Inyati,\" I said, though I was sorely tempted, \"the gun is thine; not  indeed for the stone, for that I will not take from thee, and it is  worth more than all the guns and cattle I possess. But for the gun,  guide thou me to this land of thine, that I may find these stones thou  callest magic.\"    \"That will I do readily, master,\" he answered, \"and, in truth, I am  well content to keep the stone, for the sake of the woman who gave it  me. And there are many more! And did I not say truthfully that the  stones were magic? See now, my master, the very sight of one has made  my master give me the desire of my heart the little gun that speaks  many times.\"    I gave him the Winchester there and then, and never did I see a human  being so delighted.    Late into the night we sat and talked, and planned, whilst the Bushmen  sat round their camp fire, and clucked and chattered in their queer-  sounding speech, gorging themselves to repletion on the offal of an  eland I had shot the previous day.    I learnt that Inyati's country lay far to the north-east, across the  dreaded waterless stretches of the unknown Kalahari. He had fled from  it years ago, his life forfeit to the priests or \"devil-men\" as he  called them for some cause that he did not explain, or that my limited  knowledge of his language did not permit of my understanding. The  stones were plentiful, that he assured me of again and again, but they  were sacred, or tabooed, and no one was allowed to handle them but the  priests of whom he spoke.    He had always wanted to return, but had always Feared, but now with his  \"little gun\" I believe Inyati would cheerfully have faced a thousand  priests, or for the matter of that a thousand warriors. Danger there  would be, but what was that to him and his master?    He could find his way back, though the journey would be long and  difficult; and now was the only season in which it could be undertaken;  the season when"]]]
