[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17928"],[0,"The Influence of India and Persia on the Poetry of Germany (#3)"],[1," be of Indic  origin.[23] Then there is a poem of the fourteenth or fifteenth century  on the same subject as Rueckert's parable of the man in the well, which  undoubtedly goes back to Buddhistic sources.[24] Besides these we  mention \"Vrouwenzuht\" (also called \"von dem Zornbraten\") by a poet  Sibote of the thirteenth century,[25] and Hans von Buehel's \"Diocletianus  Leben\" (about 1412), the well known story of the seven wise masters.[26]           *       *       *       *       *    The great interest which the East aroused in Europe, especially after  the period of the first crusades, is shown by the great number of poems  which have their scene of action in Oriental lands, especially in India  or Persia, or which introduce persons and things from those countries.  To indulge this fondness for Oriental scenery poets do not hesitate to  violate historical truth. Thus Charlemagne and his paladins are sent to  the Holy Land in the \"Pelerinage de Charlesmagne\"[27] and in the poem  called the \"Karl Meinet,\" a German compilation of various legends about  the Frankish hero.[28] Purely Germanic legends like those of  Ortnit-Wolfdietrich and King Rother were orientalized in much the same  manner.[29] As might be expected, it is in the court-epic and  minstrel-poetry (_Spielmannsdichtung_) where this Oriental tendency  manifests itself most markedly. A typical poem of this kind is \"Herzog  Ernst.\" The hero, a purely German character, is made to go through a  series of marvelous adventures in the East some of which bear a  striking resemblance to those of Sindbad.[30] The later strophic version  (14th century) and the prose-version of the _Volksbuch_ (probably 15th  century) localize some of these adventures definitely in the _fernen  India_.[31] Probably under the influence of this story the author of the  incompleted \"Reinfrit von Braunschweig\" (about 1300) was induced to send  his hero into Persia, to meet with somewhat similar experiences.[32]  Heinrich von Neustadt likewise lays the scene of Apollonius' adventures  in the golden valley Crysia bordering on India.[33] In the continuation  of the Parzifal-story entitled \"Der Juengere Titurel,\" which was written  by Albrecht von Scharffenberg (about 1280), the Holy Grail is to be  removed from a sinful world and to be carried to the East to be given to  Feirefiz, half brother to Parzifal.[34] The meeting of Feirefiz with the  knights furnishes the poet an opportunity of bringing in a learned  disquisition on Prester John and his _dri India die witen_, and finally  this mythical monarch offers his crown to Parzifal, who henceforth is  called _Priester Johanni_. In the poem of \"Lohengrin\", of unknown  authorship, the knight when about to depart declares he has come from  India where there is a house fairer than that at Montsalvatsch.[35]    Princes and princesses from India or Persia abound in the poems of the  court-writers and minstrels. Thus in \"Solomon und Morolf\" Salme is the  daughter of the King of _Endian_;[36] in Wolfram's \"Willehalm\" King  Alofel of Persia and King Gorhant from the _Ganjes_ figure in the battle  of Alischanz.[37] In Konrad von Wuerzburg's \"Trojanischer Krieg\" the  kings Panfilias of Persia and Achalmus of India are on the Trojan  side.[38] In the same poet's \"Partenopier\" the Sultan of Persia is the  hero's chief rival.[39] In \"Der Juengere Titurel\" Gatschiloe, a princess  from India, becomes bearer of the Grail; similarly in a poem by Der  Pleiaere, Flordibel, who comes to the Knights of the Round Table to  learn courtly manners, reveals herself as a princess from India.[40]  According to a poem of the fourteenth century the father of St.  Christopher is king of Arabia and Persia.[41] Even the folk-epic  \"Kudrun\" knows of Hilde of India, Hagen's wife.[42]    Again, wonderful things from India are abundant in this class of poetry.  The magic lance which Wigalois receives, when he is about to do battle  with a fire-spitting dragon, is from that land.[43] So also is the magic  ring given to Reinfrit when he sets out on his crusade.[44] Wigamur's  bride Dulceflur wears woven gold from the castle Gramrimort in  India,[45] and in the \"Nibelungen\" Hagen and Dancwart, when going to the  Isenstein, wear precious stones from that land.[46]    To some poets India and Persia are a sort of Ultima Thule to denote the  furthest limits of the earth, as for instance, when in the \"Rolandslied\"  Ganelun complains that for the ambition of Roland even Persia is not too  far,[47] or, when in the \"Willehalm\" King Tybalt, whose daughter has  been carried off, lets his complaint ring out as far as India.[48]    Examples might be multiplied. But they would all prove the same thing.  India and Persia were magic names to conjure with; their languages and  literatures were a book with seven seals to mediaeval Europe.

Travels to India and Persia--Olearius and his Work--Progress        of Persian Studies--Roger--India's Language and Literature remain        unknown--Oriental Influence in German Literature.      Little can be said of Oriental influence on German poetry during the  next three centuries after the Great Age of Discovery, and in an  investigation like the one in hand, which confines itself to poetry  only, this chapter might perhaps be omitted. Nevertheless a brief  consideration of this influence on German literature in general during  this period forms an "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17959"],[0,"The Hand of Fu-Manchu (#3)"],[1,"them for some moments before the mystery of their  presence there became fully appreciable to me. Then I began to wonder.  The petals (which I was disposed to class as belonging to some species  of _Curcas_ or Physic Nut), though bruised, were fresh, and therefore  could not have been in the room for many hours. How had they been  introduced, and by whom? Above all, what could their presence there  at that time portend?    \"Smith,\" I called, and walked towards the door carrying the mysterious  fragments in my palm. \"Look what I have found upon the bed.\"    Nayland Smith, who was bending over an open despatch case which he had  placed upon a chair, turned--and his glance fell upon the petals and  tiny piece of stem.    I think I have never seen so sudden a change of expression take place  in the face of any man. Even in that imperfect light I saw him blanch.  I saw a hard glitter come into his eyes. He spoke, evenly, but hoarsely:    \"Put those things down----there, on the table; anywhere.\"    I obeyed him without demur; for something in his manner had chilled me  with foreboding.    \"You did not break that stalk?\"    \"No. I found it as you see it.\"    \"Have you smelled the petals?\"    I shook my head. Thereupon, having his eyes fixed upon me with the  strangest expression in their gray depths, Nayland Smith said a  singular thing.    \"Pronounce, slowly, the words _Sakya Muni,_'\" he directed.    I stared at him, scarce crediting my senses; but----    \"I mean it!\" he rapped. \"Do as I tell you.\"    \"Sakya Muni,\" I said, in ever increasing wonder.    Smith laughed unmirthfully.    \"Go into the bathroom and thoroughly wash your hands,\" was his next  order. \"Renew the water at least three times.\" As I turned to fulfill  his instructions, for I doubted no longer his deadly earnestness:  \"Beeton!\" he called.    Beeton, very white-faced and shaky, came out from the bedroom as I  entered the bathroom, and whist I proceeded carefully to cleanse my  hands I heard Smith interrogating him.    \"Have any flowers been brought into the room today, Beeton?\"    \"Flowers, sir? Certainly not. Nothing has ever been brought in here  but what I have brought myself.\"    \"You are certain of that?\"    \"Positive.\"    \"Who brought up the meals, then?\"    \"If you'll look into my room here, sir, you'll see that I have enough  tinned and bottled stuff to last us for weeks. Sir Gregory sent me out  to buy it on the day we arrived. No one else had left or entered these  rooms until you came to-night.\"    I returned to find Nayland Smith standing tugging at the lobe of his  left ear in evident perplexity. He turned to me.    \"I find my hands over full,\" he said. \"Will you oblige me by  telephoning for Inspector Weymouth? Also, I should be glad if you  would ask M. Samarkan, the manager, to see me here immediately.\"    As I was about to quit the room--    \"Not a word of our suspicions to M. Samarkan,\" he added; \"not a word  about the brass box.\"    I was far along the corridor ere I remembered that which, remembered  earlier, had saved me the journey. There was a telephone in every suite.  However, I was not indisposed to avail myself of an opportunity for a  few moments' undisturbed reflection, and, avoiding the lift, I  descended by the broad, marble staircase.    To what strange adventure were we committed? What did the brass coffer  contain which Sir Gregory had guarded night and day? Something  associated in some way with Tibet, something which he believed to be  \"the key of India\" and which had brought in its train, presumably,  the sinister \"man with a limp.\"    Who was the \"man with the limp\"? What was the Si-Fan? Lastly, by what  conceivable means could the flower, which my friend evidently regarded  with extreme horror, have been introduced into Hale's room, and why  had I been required to pronounce the words \"Sakya Muni\"?    So ran my reflections--at random and to no clear end; and, as is often  the case in such circumstances, my steps bore them company; so that  all at once I became aware that instead of having gained the lobby of  the hotel, I had taken some wrong turning and was in a part of the  building entirely unfamiliar to me.    A long corridor of the inevitable white marble extended far behind me.  I had evidently traversed it. Before me was a heavily curtained archway.  Irritably, I pulled the curtain aside, learnt that it masked a  glass-paneled door, opened this door--and found myself in a small  court, dimly lighted and redolent of some pungent, incense-like perfume.    One step forward I took, then pulled up abruptly. A sound had come to  my ears. From a second curtained doorway, close to my right hand, it  came--a sound of muffled _tapping_, together with that of something  which dragged upon the floor.    Within my brain the words seemed audibly to form: \"The man with  the limp!\"    I sprang to the door; I had my hand upon the drapery ... when a woman  stepped out, barring the way!    No impression, not even a vague one, did I form of her costume, save  that she wore a green silk shawl, embroidered with raised white  figures of birds, thrown over her head and shoulders and draped in  such fashion that part of her face was concealed. I was transfixed  by the vindictive glare of her eyes, of her huge dark eyes.    They were ablaze with anger--but it was not this expression within  them which struck me so forcibly as the fact that they were in some  way familiar.    Motionless, we faced one another. Then--    \"You go away,\" said the woman--at the same time extending her arms  across the doorway as barriers to my progress.    Her voice had a husky intonation; her hands and arms, which were bare  and of old ivory hue, were laden with barbaric jewelry, much of it  tawdry silverware of the bazaars. Clearly she was a half-caste of some  kind, probably a Eurasian.    I hesitated. The sounds of dragging and tapping had ceased. But the  presence of this grotesque Oriental figure only increased my anxiety  to pass the doorway. I looked steadily into the black eyes; they looked  into mine unflinchingly.    \"You go away, please,\" repeated the woman, raising her right hand and  pointing to the door whereby I had entered. \"These private rooms. What  you doing here?\"    Her words, despite her broken English, served to recall to me the fact  that I was, beyond doubt, a trespasser! By what right did I presume to  force my way into other people's apartments?    \"There is some one in there whom I must see,\" I said, realizing,  however, that my chance of doing so was poor.    \"You see nobody,\" she snapped back uncompromisingly. \"You go away!\"    She took a step towards me, continuing to point to the door. Where had  I previously encountered the glance of those splendid, savage eyes?    So engaged was I with this taunting, partial memory, and so sure, if  the woman would but uncover her face, of instantly recognizing her,  that still I hesitated. Whereupon, glancing rapidly over her shoulder  into whatever place lay beyond the curtained doorway, she suddenly  stepped back and vanished, drawing the curtains to with an angry jerk.    I heard her retiring footsteps; then came a loud bang. If her object  in intercepting me had been to cover the slow retreat of some one she  had succeeded.    Recognizing that I had cut a truly sorry figure in the encounter, I  retraced my steps.    By what route I ultimately regained the main staircase I have no idea;  for my mind was busy with that taunting memory of the two dark eyes  looking out from the folds of the green embroidered shawl. Where, and  when, had I met their glance before?    To that problem I sought an answer in vain.    The message despatched to New Scotland Yard, I found M. Samarkan, long  famous as a _maitre d' hotel_ in Cairo, and now host of London's  newest and most palatial _khan_. Portly, and wearing a gray imperial,  M. Samarkan had the manners of a courtier, and the smile of a true Greek.    I told him what was necessary, and no more, desiring him to go to  suite 14a without delay and also without arousing unnecessary  attention. I dropped no hint of foul play, but M. Samarkan expressed  profound (and professional) regret that so distinguished, though  unprofitable, a patron should have selected the New Louvre, thus  early in its history, as the terminus of his career.    \"By the way,\" I said, \"have you Oriental guests with you, at the moment?\"    \"No, monsieur,\" he assured me.    \"Not a certain Oriental lady?\" I persisted.    M. Samarkan slowly shook his head.    \"Possibly monsieur has seen one of the _ayahs?_ There are several  Anglo-Indian families resident in the New Louvre at present.\"    An _ayah?_ It was just possible, of course. Yet ...      CHAPTER IV    THE FLOWER OF SILENCE      \"We are dealing now,\" said Nayland Smith, pacing restlessly up and  down our sitting-room, \"not, as of old, with Dr. Fu-Manchu, but with  an entirely unknown quantity--the Si-Fan.\"    \"For Heaven's sake!\" I cried, \"what is the Si-Fan?\"    \"The greatest mystery of the mysterious East, Petrie. Think. You know,  as I know, that a malignant being, Dr. Fu-Manchu, was for some time  in England, engaged in 'paving the way' (I believe those words were  my own) for nothing less than a giant Yellow Empire. That dream is  what millions of Europeans and Americans term 'the Yellow Peril! Very  good. Such an empire needs must have----\"    \"An emperor!\"    Nayland Smith stopped his restless pacing immediately in front of me.    \"Why not an _empress_, Petrie!\" he rapped.    His words were something of a verbal thunderbolt; I found myself at  loss for any suitable reply.    \"You will perhaps remind me,\" he continued rapidly, \"of the lowly place  held by women in the East. I can cite notable exceptions, ancient and  modern. In fact, a moment's consideration by a hypothetical body of  Eastern dynast-makers not of an emperor but of an empress.
