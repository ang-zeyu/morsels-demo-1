This  was the \"Camp of Refuge\" for all the English who refused submission to  the arbitrary rule of the foreigners, and thus it was the last strong  hold of the Saxons, and cost the Norman king much loss of time, blood,  and treasure, before he obtained possession, which was, however, at  last effected by the treachery of the abbot Thurstan. Simeon, though a  very old man when he was appointed abbot, laid the foundation of a new  church (the present Cathedral) A.D. 1083, as his brother Walkelin,  bishop of Winchester, had done there about four years before; he lived  to the age of one hundred years, and died in 1093; after this a  vacancy of seven years occurred, during which the revenues were  claimed for the use of the king (William II.) after whose death the  work was continued by Richard, the tenth and last abbot, who was  appointed on the accession of Henry I. A.D. 1100, and governed the  monastery seven years, and his church is said by Thomas of Ely[5] to  have been one of the noblest in the kingdom, and a marvel of  architectural skill; and was sufficiently far advanced to allow him to  translate into it on the 17th of October, 1106, the remains of  Etheldreda and her companions and canonized successors, placing them  behind the high altar in the new presbytery, with great pomp and  ceremony. Further progress was made under Herve le Breton, formerly  Bishop of Bangor, who was appointed administrator to the monastery  after the death of Richard.    [Footnote 5: Liber Eliensis, ii.]    Hitherto, spiritual jurisdiction over the Isle of Ely had been claimed  by the Bishop of Lincoln, but Abbot Richard obtained the consent of  the king (Henry I.) to a scheme for converting the abbacy into a  bishopric; and after much negociation, the change was effected in  1109, by the appointment of Herve (then administrator) as the first  Bishop of Ely. He set himself energetically to the task of settling  the government of his See, and of apportioning the lands and revenues  of the monastery between the monks and himself, with a keen eye to his  own interests and those of his successors.    At the time of the conversion of the abbacy into a bishopric, when the  Conventual Church became a Cathedral, the number of monks was about  fifty, though the usual number was seventy; of these the chief in  subordination to the Bishop, was the Prior, (sometimes styled the Lord  Prior) who had the superintendence over all the inferior members; and  next, the Sub-Prior, or Prior's deputy, to assist him when present and  act for him in his absence. The other officers were, the Sacrist, who  had the care of the books, vestments, plate, and ornaments belonging  to the church, as well as the superintendence of the buildings; the  Cellarer, who procured all the necessaries for the living of the  community; the Chamberlain, who provided their clothes, beds, and  bedding; the Almoner, who distributed the charities of the monastery;  the Precentor, who regulated the singing and the choristers; the  Hosteller, who entertained strangers; the Infirmarer, who had the  charge of the sick; and the Treasurer, who received the rents and  other means of revenue, and made the disbursements.    We have endeavoured briefly to bring down our history from the period  of the introduction of Christianity into East Anglia, and the  foundation of the monastery, to the time when the present Cathedral  was commenced and some way advanced; we will follow it up with a brief  account of the periods of erection of this noble edifice, reserving  the more particular description of the several parts for our survey of  the building.    There is no Cathedral in England which possesses finer examples of the  various successive styles of ecclesiastical architecture than that of  Ely; affording excellent opportunities of judging of the comparative  merits of each. The Norman portion of the building--the Nave and  Transept--is lighter in character than earlier examples of the same  style; indeed, in many places it bears marks of transition from the  round to the pointed style. Of each of the several periods of what is  usually termed Pointed, or Gothic, Ely Cathedral possesses pure and  perfect specimens: the Galilee, or western porch, and the Presbytery  were built when the Early English style was perfected: the Octagon,  the three bays of the stalled Choir, and the Lady Chapel, when the  Decorated English prevailed: and the chapels of bishops Alcock and  West when the Perpendicular style was adopted. \"It will be thus seen  that this remarkable structure completely illustrates the history of  church architecture in England from the Conquest to the Reformation,\"  viz., Norman, A.D. 1066-1150; Transitional, 1150-1200; Early English,  1200-1300; Decorated, 1300-1460; Florid, or Perpendicular,  1460-1550.[6]    [Footnote 6: The periods were thus divided by the late Mr. Sharpe:  Norman, A.D. 1066-1145; Transitional, 1145-1190; Lancet, 1190-1245;  Geometrical, 1245-1315; Curvilinear, 1315-1360; Rectilinear,  1360-1550.]    The Cathedral was commenced, as before stated, in A.D. 1083, by  Simeon, in the Norman style; the Choir, with its apse or semicircular  end--altered however to a square end before it had proceeded far--the  central Tower, the great Transept, and part of the Nave were begun by  him, but were not finished at his death in 1093; of this work, only  the ground-story of the great Transept now remains; the original plan,  as was usual in Norman churches, comprehended an eastern arm of  moderate length, a Transept, with a central Tower at the crossing, and  a Nave; the Choir usually occupying the crossing and one or more bays  of the Nave, the eastern arm being used as a presbytery or sanctuary.    After a delay of seven years, the work was carried on by Abbot Richard  (1100-1107), who probably completed them, with the exception of the  Nave, which was finished about 1174, affording a fine specimen of  later Norman, and by its extension westward gave the church the form  of a Latin cross, then much used. It is not improbable that the  Conventual Church, which the new building was intended to supersede,  stood on the site of the present Nave, and was removed from time to  time to make room for the new and enlarged building then in progress.    A few years later the great western Tower with the wings, forming a  second Transept, were begun, but whether by Bishop Harvey or by the  monks themselves during the episcopate of Bishop Nigel (1133-1169), we  cannot say; they were carried on during the episcopate of Bishop Ridel  (1174-1189), and completed as high as the first battlements during  that of his successor, Longchamp (1189-1197), producing a fine example  of what is called the Transitional style. During this latter period  the Romanesque had been rapidly giving way to the Pointed style, and  thus as the building progressed one style merged into the other.    After some years further progress was made towards the west, as the  Galilee, or western porch, is stated to have been erected by Bishop  Eustace (1198-1215), of whom it is recorded that \"he built from the  foundation the new Galilee of the Church at Ely, towards the west, at  his own cost.\" \"This has given rise to much difference of opinion.  Some persons think that by the 'Galilee towards the west,' is meant  the western porch, while others holding that so fine a work is  inconsistent with so early a date, suppose the Galilee to have been  the northern half (now lost) of the western Transept.... My own  impression has always been that it was the west porch which still  exists.\"[7] Be this as it may, it is a beautiful specimen of the Early  English style; and Bishop Northwold (1229-1254) took down the east end  of the church and lengthened it by the six eastern arches, usually  called the Presbytery, with its magnificent eastern facade, in the  same style; they were begun A.D. 1234, and finished and dedicated in  1252, being \"one of the noblest pieces of architecture of that  glorious architectural period.\" About the same time a spire of timber  covered with lead was erected on the Tower.    [Footnote 7: Lecture on Ely Cathedral by the late Sir G.G. Scott, at  the Etheldreda Festival, Oct. 1873.]    We now come to the period in which the \"two great and famous  productions of the fourteenth century--the two special objects of  pride which our Cathedral boasts--the Lady Chapel and the central  Octagon, with the three adjoining bays eastward,\"[8] were erected;  \"each work is of the highest and of undisputed merit, and forms a most  marked feature in the building;\"[9] affording most admirable specimens  of the Decorated English style. In 1321 the foundation stone of the  vast and magnificent Lady Chapel was laid by Alan de Walsingham, then  sub-prior, in the time of Bishop Hotham (1316-1337), the work was  continued under Bishop Montacute (1337-1345), and finished in 1349,  under Bishop L'Isle (1345-1362). In the year following the  commencement of this work the fall of the great central Tower took  place, ruining the adjoining bays all round, and especially those of  the Norman Presbytery. This catastrophe was not altogether unexpected,  for the monks had discontinued the use of the Choir and held their  services in St. Catherine's Chapel, in the western part of the  Cathedral. The Tower fell with such noise and violence as \"to make the  whole city to tremble, and to cause men to think that an earthquake  had taken place.\" The work of rebuilding was soon undertaken, and  under the skilful directions of the same Alan de Walsingham (who was  doubtless the architect of both these erections,) the grand work was  accomplished; the stone-work of the Octagon was finished (if indeed it  ever was quite finished) in 1328, and the woodwork and roof about  1342. The plan of the Octagon included in its area one bay on each of  its four sides.

INTRODUCTION      AMERICA BEFORE COLUMBUS    Man made his appearance on the western continent unnumbered ages ago,  not unlikely before the close of the glacial period. It is possible that  human life began in Asia and western North America sooner than on either  shore of the Atlantic. Nothing wholly forbids the belief that America  was even the cradle of the race, or one of several cradles, though most  scientific writers prefer the view that our species came hither from  Asia. De Nadaillac judges it probable that the ocean was thus crossed  not at Behring Strait alone, but along a belt of equatorial islands as  well. We may think of successive waves of such immigration--perhaps the  easiest way to account for certain differences among American races.    It is, at any rate, an error to speak of the primordial Americans as  derived from any Asiatic stock at present existing or known to history.  The old Americans had scarcely an Asiatic feature. Their habits and  customs were emphatically peculiar to themselves. Those in which they  agreed with the trans-Pacific populations, such as fashion of weapons  and of fortifications, elements of folk-lore, religious ideas,  traditions of a flood, belief in the destruction of the world by fire,  and so on, are nearly all found the world over, the spontaneous  creations of our common human intelligence.    The original American peoples, various and unlike as they were, agreed  in four traits, three of them physical, one mental, which mark them off  as in all likelihood primarily of one stock after all, and as different  from any Old World men: (1) They had low, retreating foreheads. (2)  Their hair was black. (3) It was also of a peculiar texture, lank, and  cylindrical in section, never wavy. And (4) their languages were  polysynthetic, forming a class apart from all others in the world. The  peoples of America, if from Asia, must date back to a time when speech  itself was in its infancy.    [Illustration: Temple Mound In Mexico.]    The numerous varieties of ancient Americans reduce to two distinct types  --the Dolicocephalous or long-skulled, and the Brachycephalous or  short-skulled. Morton names these types respectively the Toltecan and  the American proper. The Toltecan type was represented by the primitive  inhabitants of Mexico and by the Mound-builders of our Mississippi  Valley; the American proper, by the Indians. The Toltecans made far the  closer approach to civilization, though the others possessed a much  greater susceptibility therefor than the modern Indians of our prairies  would indicate.    Of the Mound-builders painfully little is known. Many of their mounds  still remain, not less mysterious or interesting than the pyramids of  Egypt, perhaps almost equally ancient. The skeletons exhumed from them  often fly into dust as soon as exposed to air, a rare occurrence with  the oldest bones found in Europe. On the parapet-crest of the Old Fort  at Newark, 0., trees certainly five hundred years old have been cut, and  they could not have begun their growth till long after the earth-works  had been deserted. In some mounds, equally aged trees root in the  decayed trunks of a still anterior growth.    Much uncertainty continues to shroud the design of these mounds. Some  were for military defence, others for burial places, others for lookout  stations, others apparently for religious uses. Still others, it is  supposed, formed parts of human dwellings. That they proceeded from  intelligence and reflection is clear. Usually, whether they are squares  or circles, their construction betrays nice, mathematical exactness,  unattainable save by the use of instruments. Many constitute  effigies--of birds, fishes, quadrupeds, men. In Wisconsin is a mound 135  feet long and well proportioned, much resembling an elephant; in Adams  County, 0., a gracefully curved serpent, 1,000 feet long, with jaws  agape as if to swallow an egg-shaped figure in front; in Granville, in  the same State, one in the form of a huge crocodile; in Greenup County,  Ky., an image of a bear, which seems leaning forward in an attitude of  observation, measuring 53 feet from the top of the back to the end of  the foreleg, and 105-1/2 feet from the tip of the nose to the rear of  the hind foot.    [Illustration: Big Elephant Mound, Wisconsin.]    The sites of towns and cities were artfully selected, near navigable  rivers and their confluences, as at Marietta, Cincinnati, and in  Kentucky opposite the old mouth of the Scioto. Points for defence were  chosen and fortified with scientific precision. The labor expended upon  these multitudinous structures must have been enormous, implying a vast  population and extensive social, economic, and civil organization. The  Cahokia mound, opposite St. Louis, is 90 feet high and 900 feet long.    The Mound-builders made elegant pottery, of various design and accurate  shapes, worked bone and all sorts of stones, and even forged copper.  There are signs that they understood smelting this metal. They certainly  mined it in large quantities, and carried it down the Mississippi  hundreds of miles from its source on Lake Superior. They must have been  masters of river navigation, but their mode of conveying vast burdens  overland, destitute of efficient draft animals as they apparently were,  we can hardly even conjecture.    The Mound-builders, as we have said, were related to the antique  populations of Mexico and Central America, and the most probable  explanation of their departure from their Northern seats is that in face  of pestilence, or of some overpowering human foe, they retreated to the  Southwest, there to lay, under better auspices, the foundations of new  states, and to develop that higher civilization whose relics, too little  known, astound the student of the past, as greatly as do the stupendous  pillars of Carnac or the grotesque animal figures of Khorsabad and  Nimrud.    So much has been written about the American Indians that we need not  discuss them at length. They were misnamed Indians by Columbus, who  supposed the land he had discovered to be India. At the time of his  arrival not more than two hundred thousand of them lived east of the  Mississippi, though they were doubtless far more numerous West and  South. Whence they came, or whether, if this was a human deed at all,  they or another race now extinct drove out the Mound-builders, none can  tell.    Of arts the red man had but the rudest. He made wigwams, canoes, bone  fish-hooks with lines of hide or twisted bark, stone tomahawks,  arrow-heads and spears, clothing of skins, wooden bows, arrows, and  clubs. He loved fighting, finery, gambling, and the chase. He  domesticated no animals but the dog and possibly the hog. Sometimes  brave, he was oftener treacherous, cruel, revengeful. His power of  endurance on the trail or the warpath was incredible, and if captured,  he let himself be tortured to death without a quiver or a cry. Though  superstitious, he believed in a Great Spirit to be worshipped without  idols, and in a future life of happy hunting and feasting.    Whether, at the time of which we now speak, the Indians were an old  race, already beginning to decline, or a fresh race, which contact with  the whites balked of its development, it is difficult to say. Their  career since best accords with the former supposition. In either case we  may assume that their national groupings and habitats were nearly the  same in 1500 as later, when these became accurately known. In the  eighteenth century the Algonquins occupied all the East from Nova Scotia  to North Carolina, and stretched west to the Mississippi. At one time  they numbered ninety thousand. The Iroquois or Five Nations had their  seat in Central and Western New York. North and west of them lived the  Hurons or Wyandots. The Appalachians, embracing Cherokees, Creeks,  Choctaws, Chickasaws, Seminoles and a number of lesser tribes, occupied  all the southeastern portion of what is now the United States. West of  the Mississippi were the Dakotas or Sioux.    Since the white man's arrival upon these shores, very few changes have  occurred among the brute inhabitants of North America. A few species, as  the Labrador duck and the great auk, have perished. America then  possessed but four animals which had appreciable economic value; the  dog, the reindeer at the north, which the Mound-builders used as a  draft animal but the Indians did not, and the llama and the paco south  of the equator. Every one of our present domestic animals originated  beyond the Atlantic, being imported hither by our ancestors. The Indians  of the lower Mississippi Valley, when De Soto came, had dogs, and also  what the Spaniards called hogs, perhaps peccaries, but neither brute was  of any breed now bred in the country. A certain kind of dogs were native  also to the Juan Fernandez and the Falkland Islands.    Mr. Edward John Payne is doubtless correct in maintaining, in his  \"History of the New World called America,\" that the backwardness of the  American aborigines was largely due to their lack of animals suitable  for draft or travel or producing milk or flesh good for food. From the  remotest antiquity Asiatics had the horse, ass, ox and cow, camel and  goat--netting ten times the outfit in useful animals which the  Peruvians, Mexicans, or Indians enjoyed.    The vegetable kingdom of Old America was equally restricted, which also  helps explain its low civilization. At the advent of"]]]
