Hence the judicious landscape-painter  knows how to avail himself of warmth and coolness in the juxtaposition  of his greens, in addition to their lightness and darkness, or  brilliancy and brokenness, in producing the most beautiful and varied  effects; effects which spring in other cases from a like management of  blue, white, &c. These powers of a colour upon itself are highly  important to the artist, and lead to that gratification from fine  colouring, which a good eye ever enjoys.    In landscape we see nature employing broken colours in harmonious  consonance and variety, while, equally true to picturesque relations,  she uses also broken forms and figures, in conjoint harmony with  colours; occasionally throwing into the composition a regular form, or a  primary colour, for the sake of animation and contrast. And if we  inspect her works more closely, we shall find that they have no uniform  tints. Whether in the animal, vegetable or mineral creation--flesh or  foliage, earth or sky, flower or stone--however uniform the colour may  appear at a distance, it will, when examined nearly, be found to  consist of a variety of hues and shades, compounded with harmony and  intelligence.    It is for this reason that no two colours are ever found discordant in  nature, however much so they may be in art. Blue and green have been  termed discordant, and in painting they may undoubtedly be made so. Yet  those are two colours which nature seems to intend never to be  separated, and never to be felt, either of them, in its full beauty,  without the other--a blue sky through green leaves, or a blue wave with  green lights through it, being precisely the loveliest things, next to  clouds at sunrise, in this coloured world of ours. A good eye for colour  will soon discover how constantly nature puts green and purple together,  purple and scarlet, green and blue, yellow and neutral grey, and the  like; and how she strikes these colour-concords for general tones,  before working into them with innumerable subordinate ones.    Upon the more intimate union, or the blending and gradience of contrasts  from one to another mutually, depend some of the most fascinating  effects of colouring. The practical principle employed in producing them  is important, and consists in the blending and gradating by _mixture_,  while we avoid the _compounding_ of contrasting colours. That is, the  colours must be kept distinct in the act of blending them, or otherwise  they will run into dusky neutrality and defile each other. This is the  case in blending and gradating from green to red, or from hue to  hue--from blue to orange, or to and from coldness and warmth--from  yellow to purple, or to and from advancing and retiring colours. It is  the same in light and shade, or white and black, which _mix_ with  clearness. Now, there are only two ways in which this distinctness in  union of contrasts can be effected in practice: the one is by hatching  or breaking them together in mixture, without compounding them  uniformly; and the other is by glazing, in which the colours unite and  penetrate mutually, without monotonous composition.    The former process may be said to be the carrying out of the principle  of separate colours to the utmost possible refinement, by using atoms of  colour in juxtaposition, instead of in large spaces. And it is to be  noted, in filling up minute interstices of this kind, that if the colour  with which they are filled be wanted to show brightly, a rather positive  point of it had better be put, with a little white left beside or round  it in the interstice. This plan is preferable to laying a pale tint of  the colour over the whole interstice. Yellow or orange, for instance,  will hardly show, if pale, in small spaces; but they show brightly in  free touches, however small, with white beside them. The latter mode is  founded on the fact, that if a dark colour be laid first, and a little  blue or white body-colour struck lightly over it, a more beautiful gray  will be obtained than by mixing the colour and the blue or white.  Similarly, if over a solid and perfectly dry touch of vermilion there be  quickly washed a little very wet carmine, a much more brilliant red will  be produced than by mixing the two colours.    Transparency and opacity constitute another contrast of colouring, the  former of which belongs to shade and blackness, the latter to light and  whiteness. Even contrast has its contrast, for _gradations_ or  _intermedia_ are opposed to contrasts or _extremes_; and, upon the right  management of contrasts and gradations depend the harmony and melody,  the tone, effect, and general expression of a picture. Thus, painting is  an affair of judicious contrasting so far as regards colour, if even it  be not such altogether.    Colour, it has already been observed, is wholly _relative_. In  contrasting, therefore, any colour, if we wish it to have light or  brilliancy, we cast its opposite into the shade; if we would have it  warm, we cool its antagonist; and if transparent, we oppose it by an  opaque contrary, and _vice versâ_: indeed, in practice, all these must  be in some measure combined.    Such are some of the powers of contrast in colouring alone, and such is  the diversity of art upon which skill in colouring depends. It must not  be forgotten, however, that contrasts or extremes, whether of light and  shade, or of colours, become violent and offensive when they are not  reconciled by the interposition of their media, or intermediates, which  partake of both extremes of the contrasts. Thus blue and orange in  contrast become reconciled, softened in effect, and harmonized, when a  broken colour composed of the two intervenes. The same may be said of  other colours, shades, and contrasts.    Seeing that the management and mastery of colours are to a great extent  dependent on the same principles as light and shade, it might become a  point of good discipline, after acquiring the use of black and white in  the chiaroscuro, to paint designs in contrast; that is, with two  contrasting colours only, in conjunction with black and white--for  example, with blue and orange, before attempting the whole. Indeed,  black can be dispensed with in these cases, because it may be  compounded, since the neutral grey and third colours always arise from  the compounding of contrasting colours. In this way, even flesh may be  painted--for instance, with red and green alone, as Gainsborough is said  at one period to have done.    Some artists have produced pictures in the above hot and cold colours  only; which, although captivating to the eye, and true in theory with  respect to colour, light and shade, are generally false in practice with  regard to nature, which rarely employs such extreme accordances.  Colouring like this, therefore, is more beautiful than true. It is as  though a painter were to execute a landscape in the full light of day,  as he saw it looking through a prism, so that every object glowed with  rainbow hues. Such a picture would present a beautiful fairy scene, and  be true as regards colours, but as respects nature, it would be false.    Colour, and what in painting is called transparency, belong chiefly to  shade. It has been a common error to ascribe those properties to light  only, and hence many have employed a uniform shade tint, regarding  shadows as simply darkness, blackness, or the mere absence of light;  when, in truth, shadows are infinitely varied by colour, and always so  by the colours of the lights which produce them. But while we incline  attention toward the relation of colour to shade, both light and shade  being strictly co-essential to colour, a vicious extreme must be  avoided. For although, as transparent, colour inclines to shade, and, as  opaque, it partakes of light; yet the general tendency of colour is to  transparency and shade, all colour being a departure from light. Hence  it becomes a maxim, which he who aspires to good colouring must never  lose sight of, that _the colour of shadow is always transparent, and  only that of extreme light objects opaque_. It follows, that white is to  be kept as much as possible out of shadow, and black, for the same  reason, out of colour. In their stead, whenever it is necessary to  cover, opaque tints may be employed, glazed over with transparent  colours. Such practice would also be more favourable to durability of  the tones of pictures, than the shades and tints produced with black and  white. The hues and shadows of nature are in no ordinary case either  black or white, which, except as local colours, are always poor and  frigid. The perfection of colouring is to combine harmony with  brilliancy, unity with variety, and freshness with force, without  violating the laws of nature.    With regard to the _perspective of colours_, or the manner in which they  affect the eye, according to position and distance, it is a branch of  aërial perspective or the perspective of light and shade. This is  distinguished from linear perspective, or the perspective of drawing, as  drawing is from colouring; and they have progressed alike in the art.  The most ancient painters seem to have known little of either; and  linear perspective was established as science before the aërial, as  drawing and composition preceded colouring.    The perspective of colours depends upon their powers to reflect the  elements of light, powers which are by no means uniform. Accordingly,  blue is lost in the distance before red, and yellow is seen at a point  at which red would disappear; yet blue preserves its hue better than  yellow, because colours are cooled in the distance. In this respect,  the compound colours partake of the powers of their components, in"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20916"],[0,"The Arabian Nights: Their Best-known Tales (#3)"],[1,"they  had meditated against the queen.    Shortly afterward a young prince, as bright as the day, was born to the  queen; but neither his innocence nor beauty could move the cruel hearts  of the merciless sisters. They wrapped him up carelessly in his cloths  and put him into a basket, which they abandoned to the stream of a small  canal that ran under the queen's apartment, and declared that she had  given birth to a puppy. This dreadful intelligence was announced to the  emperor, who became so angry at the circumstance, that he was likely to  have occasioned the queen's death, if his grand vizier had not  represented to him that he could not, without injustice, make her  answerable for the misfortune.    In the meantime, the basket in which the little prince was exposed was  carried by the stream beyond a wall which bounded the prospect of the  queen's apartment, and from thence floated with the current down the  gardens. By chance the intendant of the emperor's gardens, one of the  principal officers of the kingdom, was walking in the garden by the side  of this canal, and, perceiving a basket floating, called to a gardener  who was not far off, to bring it to shore that he might see what it  contained. The gardener, with a rake which he had in his hand, drew the  basket to the side of the canal, took it up, and gave it to him. The  intendant of the gardens was extremely surprised to see in the basket a  child, which, though he knew it could be but just born, had very fine  features. This officer had been married several years, but though he had  always been desirous of having children, Heaven had never blessed him  with any. This accident interrupted his walk: he made the gardener  follow him with the child, and when he came to his own house, which was  situated at the entrance to the gardens of the palace, went into his  wife's apartment. \"Wife,\" said he, \"as we have no children of our own,  God has sent us one. I recommend him to you; provide him a nurse, and  take as much care of him as if he were our own son; for, from this  moment, I acknowledge him as such.\" The intendant's wife received the  child with great joy, and took particular pleasure in the care of him.  The intendant himself would not inquire too narrowly whence the infant  came. He saw plainly it came not far off from the queen's apartment, but  it was not his business to examine too closely into what had passed, nor  to create disturbances in a place where peace was so necessary.    The following year another prince was born, on whom the unnatural  sisters had no more compassion than on his brother, but exposed him  likewise in a basket and set him adrift in the canal, pretending, this  time, that the sultana had given birth to a cat. It was happy also for  this child that the intendant of the gardens was walking by the canal  side, for he had it carried to his wife, and charged her to take as much  care of it as of the former, which was as agreeable to her inclination  as it was to his own.    The emperor of Persia was more enraged this time against the queen than  before, and she had felt the effects of his anger if the grand vizier's  remonstrances had not prevailed. The third year the queen gave birth to  a princess, which innocent babe underwent the same fate as her brothers,  for the two sisters, being determined not to desist from their  detestable schemes till they had seen the queen cast off and humbled,  claimed that a log of wood had been born and exposed this infant also on  the canal. But the princess, as well as her brothers, was preserved from  death by the compassion and charity of the intendant of the gardens.    Kosrouschah could no longer contain himself, when he was informed of the  new misfortune. He pronounced sentence of death upon the wretched queen  and ordered the grand vizier to see it executed.    The grand vizier and the courtiers who were present cast themselves at  the emperor's feet, to beg of him to revoke the sentence. \"Your majesty,  I hope, will give me leave,\" said the grand vizier, \"to represent to  you, that the laws which condemn persons to death were made to punish  crimes; the three extraordinary misfortunes of the queen are not crimes,  for in what can she be said to have contributed toward them? Your  majesty may abstain from seeing her, but let her live. The affliction in  which she will spend the rest of her life, after the loss of your  favour, will be a punishment sufficiently distressing.\"    The emperor of Persia considered with himself, and, reflecting that it  was unjust to condemn the queen to death for what had happened, said:  \"Let her live then; I will spare her life, but it shall be on this  condition: that she shall desire to die more than once every day. Let a  wooden shed be built for her at the gate of the principal mosque, with  iron bars to the windows, and let her be put into it, in the coarsest  habit; and every Mussulman that shall go into the mosque to prayers  shall heap scorn upon her. If any one fail, I will have him exposed to  the same punishment; and that I may be punctually obeyed, I charge you,  vizier, to appoint persons to see this done.\" The emperor pronounced his  sentence in such a tone that the grand vizier durst not further  remonstrate; and it was executed, to the great satisfaction of the two  envious sisters. A shed was built, and the queen, truly worthy of  compassion, was put into it and exposed ignominiously to the contempt of  the people, which usage she bore with a patient resignation that excited  the compassion of those who were discriminating and judged of things  better than the vulgar.    The two princes and the princess were, in the meantime, nursed and  brought up by the intendant of the gardens and his wife with the  tenderness of a father and mother; and as they advanced in age, they all  showed marks of superior dignity, which discovered itself every day by a  certain air which could only belong to exalted birth. All this increased  the affections of the intendant and his wife, who called the eldest  prince Bahman, and the second Perviz, both of them names of the most  ancient emperors of Persia, and the princess, Periezade, which name also  had been borne by several queens and princesses of the kingdom.    As soon as the two princes were old enough, the intendant provided  proper masters to teach them to read and write; and the princess, their  sister, who was often with them, showing a great desire to learn, the  intendant, pleased with her quickness, employed the same master to teach  her also. Her vivacity and piercing wit made her, in a little time, as  great a proficient as her brothers. From that time the brothers and  sister had the same masters in geography, poetry, history, and even the  secret sciences, and made so wonderful a progress that their tutors were  amazed, and frankly owned that they could teach them nothing more. At  the hours of recreation, the princess learned to sing and play upon all  sorts of instruments; and when the princes were learning to ride she  would not permit them to have that advantage over her, but went through  all the exercises with them, learning to ride also, to bend the bow, and  dart the reed or javelin, and oftentimes outdid them in the race and  other contests of agility.    The intendant of the gardens was so overjoyed to find his adopted  children so accomplished in all the perfections of body and mind, and  that they so well requited the expense he had been at in their  education, that he resolved to be at a still greater; for, as he had  until then been content simply with his lodge at the entrance of the  garden, and kept no country-house, he purchased a mansion at a short  distance from the city, surrounded by a large tract of arable land,  meadows, and woods. As the house was not sufficiently handsome nor  convenient, he pulled it down, and spared no expense in building a more  magnificent residence. He went every day to hasten, by his presence, the  great number of workmen he employed, and as soon as there was an  apartment ready to receive him, passed several days together there when  his presence was not necessary at court; and by the same exertions, the  interior was furnished in the richest manner, in consonance with the  magnificence of the edifice. Afterward he made gardens, according to a  plan drawn by himself. He took in a large extent of ground, which he  walled around, and stocked with fallow deer, that the princes and  princess might divert themselves with hunting when they chose.    When this country seat was finished and fit for habitation, the  intendant of the gardens went and cast himself at the emperor's feet,  and, after representing how long he had served, and the infirmities of  age which he found growing upon him, begged that he might be permitted  to resign his charge into his majesty's disposal and retire. The emperor  gave him leave, with the more pleasure, because he was satisfied with  his long services, both in his father's reign and his own, and when he  granted it, asked what he should do to recompense him. \"Sir,\" replied  the intendant of the gardens, \"I have received so many obligations from  your majesty and the late emperor, your father, of happy memory, that I  desire no more than the honour of dying in your favour.\" He took his  leave of the emperor and retired with the two princes and the princess  to the country retreat he had built. His wife had been dead some years,  and he himself had not lived above six months with his charges before he  was surprised by so sudden a death that he had not time to give them the  least account of the manner in which he had discovered them. The Princes  Bahman and Perviz, and the Princess Periezade, who knew no other father  than the intendant of the emperor's gardens, regretted and bewailed him  as such, and paid all the honours in his funeral obsequies which love  and filial gratitude required of them."]]]
