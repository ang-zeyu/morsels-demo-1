Vishnu is the same divinity among other races,  conceived under the influence of a softer climate in a modified form as  the blue sky. Both divinities, originally belonging to different parts  of India, were afterwards taken, first Vishnu, and then also Siva, into  the theological system of the Brahmins, and formed with Brahma, but not  until the fourth century after Christ, the trimurti, according to which  the one supreme being Parabrama is worshiped in the threefold form of  Brahma the creating, Vishnu the sustaining, and Siva the destroying  power of nature. To this later period of Brahminism belongs also the  alteration of the old epics, the Ramayana and Mahabharata, by which the  heroes Rama and Krishna are represented as avatars, that is incarnations  or human impersonations, of Vishnu. In this also there is evidently an  effort to bring the deity, conceived as the abstract One, into closer  union with man, an effort which is likewise visible in the later Yoga  system of the Brahmins, in which, by the admission of Buddhistic  elements, the visible world is recognized as real, the old rigid  asceticism mitigated, Vishnu represented as the soul of the world, and  immortality taught as a return of the individual soul to Brahma.      2. THE WEST ARIANS, IRANIANS.    [THE BACTRIANS, MEDES, PERSIANS.]    The ancient religion of the Bactrians in the period before Zoroaster was  patriarchal, and consisted in the worship of fire, as the beneficent  power of nature, and of Mithras, the god of the sun, combined with that  of the good spirits (Ahuras), among which were Geus-Urva (the spirit of  the earth), Cpento-mainyus (the white spirit), Armaiti (the earth, or  also the spirit of piety), and of the hero-spirits Sraosha, Traetona,  which as light and darkness are distinguished from Angro (the black  spirit).    Later, as it seems, the theology and worship of the neighboring nomadic  Arya penetrated to these nations, and caused a religious conflict which  ended with the migration of Arya to the south. At this period  Zarathustra[2] (Zoroaster) came forward under the Bactrian priest and  King Kava Vistaspa, as defender and reformer of the religion of the  fathers against the encroachments of a strange doctrine. The Devas  (Zend, Dews) or the gods of the Indian Veda appear with Zarathustra as  evil spirits. Not Indra, but the hero Traetona, wages war with Ahi  (Zend, Azhi), while the kavis, or priests, are attacked by him as  deceivers and liars. From the belief in good spirits (Ahuras, i.e.,  the living, and Mazdas, i.e., the wise), the ancient genii of the  country, Zarathustra developed the belief of one highest God,  Ahura-Mazda (Ormuzd, Greek, [Greek: Osompzes]), a doctrine which he  received by divine inspiration through the mediation of the spirit  Srasha. Ahura-Mazda, surrounded by the Amesha-Spenta (Amshaspands), or  the holy immortals, not until later reduced to seven, is the creator of  light and life. The hurtful and evil, on the contrary, is non-existence  (akem), and in the oldest parts of the Avesta, the Gathas, which go back  to Zarathustra and his first followers, is not yet conceived as a  personal being. First in the Vendidad, written after Zarathustra, does  Angro-mainyus (Ahriman), or the evil one, with his Dews, although  subordinated to Ahura-Mazda, gain a place in the Iranian conception of  the universe, as the adversary of Ahura-Mazda, and as the cause of evil  in the natural and spiritual world. From these conceptions there was  developed in the later Parsism the system of the four periods of the  world, each of three thousand years, in the book \"Bundehesh.\" In the  first period, Ahura-Mazda appears as creator of the world and as the  source of good. The creation, completed by Ahura-Mazda in six days by  means of the word (Honover), is in the second period destroyed by  Angro-mainyus, who, appearing upon the earth in the form of a serpent,  seduces the first human pair, created by Ahura-Mazda. In the third  period, which begins with the revelation given to Zarathustra,  Ahura-mazda and Angro-mainyus strive together for man. After this  follows, in the fourth period, the victory gained by Ahura-Mazda.  Sosiosh (Saoshyas), the deliverer already foretold in the Vendidad,  appears. The resurrection of the dead, not taught by Zarathustra or in  the Vendidad, takes place. The judgment of the world begins; the good  are received into paradise and the sinners banished to hell. At last,  all is purified, and Angro-mainyus himself and his Dews submit  themselves to Ahura-Mazda, whose victory is celebrated in heaven with  songs of praise.    Thus among the Iranian races, out of the old patriarchal worship of fire  and light, on the occasion of the religious struggle with the Indian  Arya, and under the influence of Zarathustra, there was developed the  doctrine of one supreme God,[3] who, surrounded by the good spirits of  heaven, wages war against evil, whence arose later the moral opposition  between Ahura-Mazda and Angro-mainyus resulting in the victory of the  good principle over the bad. The old dualism of force and matter,  beneficent and destructive powers of nature, light and darkness, becomes  in Parsism moral. The deity, no longer identified with nature, becomes a  personal, spiritual being, the creator of mankind; and the end of the  world's development is conceived as the triumph of the good. Hence the  high rank which the doctrine of Zarathustra and its further development  holds in the history of religion.      3. THE GREEKS.    As man rises in spiritual development, nature becomes to him a  revelation ever more and more manifold of the divine. To the Greek  (Pelasgi, Hellenes) the whole of nature was living, and his imagination  peopled her everywhere with divine beings, who in wood and field, in  rivers and on mountains (Oreads, Dryads, Naiads, Sileni, &c.), hovered  friendly round him. The Greek was indeed distinguished from other  nations by this richer and more elevated view of nature; but he excelled  them most of all in this, that the divine object which he worshiped was  conceived both in form and character after the human. Zeus, Phoebus  Apollo, Pallas Athene, Aphrodite, Ares, Hephaestus, Hestia, Hermes,  Artemis, were originally powers of nature personified, as some epithets  in Homer[4] still indicate; but they became, sometimes under the same  names, types of power and lordship, science and art, courage and  sensuous beauty. While Dionysus, Demeter, Hades, and Persephone remained  earthly, and Helios, Eos, Iris, and Hecate, heavenly divinities, and  Oceanus, Poseidon, Amphitrite, Proteus, and Nereus ruled the waters,  Zeus was conceived as the god of the sky and of thunder, who hurled the  bolts, the great king and lawgiver, the father of men, and Hera,  originally the air, became the protecting goddess of married life;  Apollo, the god of light, who shot forth his arrows, not at first  identified with Helios, became the god of divination and poetry, who led  the choir of the muses; the goddess of light, Athene, became the  contentious goddess of wisdom; Aphrodite, born of the foam of the sea,  once the symbol of the fruitful power of nature, later, encircled by the  Graces, became the type of womanly beauty and charm, to which the  strength of man, personified in Ares, corresponds. In like manner in the  later mythology, Hephaestus, the god of fire, appeared as the god of the  forge, Hestia, the goddess of fire, as the protector of the household  hearth, and Hermes, the god of the storm and of rain, as the messenger  of the gods, the type of cunning and craftiness, while Artemis, the  goddess of the moon, the fruitful mother of nature, took the character  of the chaste maiden, the goddess of hunting, who with her nymphs and  hounds nightly roamed the fields and woods. The monsters, the Sphinx,  the Minotaur, the Cyclops, the Centaurs, symbols of a yet unhuman or  half human power of nature, were overcome by the Greek heroes, Perseus,  Hercules, Jason, Theseus, OEdipus, the types of human strength and  valor. The religious festivals were enlivened by trials of men's  strength and skill in games, and the historian and poet offered to the  gods the products of human genius. In the religion of the Greeks,  however, the moral element, although not passed over and in the Greek  epic and tragedy not seldom expressed in grand characters, stood  nevertheless too little in the foreground, so that the worship of the  divine, as in the older nature-worship, especially in the feasts in  honor of Dionysus and Aphrodite, was marked by immoral practices. The  conception of a future life, which taken in connection with a future  retribution has a moral tendency, had but little attraction for the  Greek, who rejoiced in the glory of the earth, and saw in nature and in  man the kingdom of the divine. The passage from the earlier poetical  nature-worship to the worship of the divine in human form seems to be  indicated in the war which Olympian Zeus waged with Cronos and the  Titans. The origin and development of the various elements and powers of  nature, Chaos, Eros, Uranus, Gaea, the Giants, Styx, Erebus, Hemera,  AEther, &c, became, with the poets and philosophers after Homer, matters  of speculation, of which the theogonies of Hesiod, Orpheus, Pherecydes,  and others furnish proof.      4. THE ROMANS.    In the religion of the Greeks, the aesthetic and moral character of the  Grecian people was deified, and in the Romans also we see how that which  men value most exerts an influence upon their worship of the divine. The  primitive religion of the Romans, borrowed from the Sabines and  Etruscans, bears everywhere, in distinction to that of the Greeks, the  marks of the practical and political character of the Roman people. The  oldest national divinities are, first, Jupiter or Jovis, the god of the  heavens, Mars or Mavors, the god of the"]]]
