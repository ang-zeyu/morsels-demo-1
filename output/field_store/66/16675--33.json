ROBIN REDBREAST    MERRY ROBIN REDBREAST      \"Robin, robin redbreast,      Singing on the bough,    Come and get your breakfast,      We will feed you now.    Robin likes the golden grain,    Nods his head and sings again:      'Chirping, chirping cheerily,    Here I come so merrily,      Thank you, children dear!'\"    Thus sang Phyllis one morning during the second week in March.    In the topmost bough of the old apple-tree sat Robin Redbreast, looking  altogether doubtful as to whether he liked the little girl's song.    But when he saw the grains of wheat which the child was scattering on  the ground for his breakfast, he thought better of his doubt.    He hopped lower on the branches.  He turned his little head on one side  and looked at Phyllis in a very friendly fashion.    \"Come on down!\" Phyllis begged.  \"I am so glad that you have returned.  I am so glad that you came to this very apple-tree and sang so strong  and loud and clear!\"    \"Chirp!  Chirp!\" and the robin hopped again nearer.    \"You see,\" Phyllis went on, in her coaxing little voice, \"my brother  Jack, being a boy, said he would be the one to see the first robin this  year.    \"But I made up my mind that if watchful eyes and careful ears could  help a little girl, I would get ahead of Jack.    \"Sure enough, the first thing I heard this morning was your sweet song.  When did you arrive?  Aren't you rather early?\"    By this time the robin was on the ground, pecking away at the grain.  As he ate his breakfast he told his story.    [Illustration: \"By this time the robin was on the ground\" (missing from  book)]    \"I have been south all winter long,\" he said.  \"It is very lovely in  the southland.  Food is plenty, the days are long, and the sunshine is  golden, bright, and warm.    \"But as soon as the spring days came I grew restless.  I knew the snow  was beginning to melt and the grass to grow green in my old home  country.  I wanted to start north at once.    \"I spoke to my little mate about it, and found her to be as homesick as  I.  So we flew north a little earlier than usual this year, and arrived  ahead of the others.  We are now quite anxious to get to housekeeping,  and are already looking for a suitable place for a nest.\"    \"If you will build near us,\" said Phyllis, \"I will help you care for  your little ones.  I will give you all the crumbs that you can eat.\"    \"Oh! oh!\" chirped the robin; \"you are very kind, Phyllis, but I hardly  think you would know how to feed bird babies.    \"You see our babies are so fond of bugs and worms and all sorts of  insects, that they do not care for crumbs when they can have nice fat  worms.    \"We sometimes feed berries and cherries to our babies.  We older birds  often eat fruit, but really we like worms and bugs better.\"    \"The robins ate all the cherries from the top of our cherry-tree last  year,\" said Phyllis.    \"Yes, we did eat some of your cherries,\" admitted the robin.  \"They  were very sweet and juicy.    \"There are people who say that we robins are a nuisance, and that we  destroy so much fruit that they wish we would never come near them.  The fact is, we do more good than harm to your orchards and berry  patches.  Just think how many insects we destroy!  If it were not for  us I think much more fruit would be destroyed by insects.  And worms  and caterpillars would be crawling everywhere.    \"A robin is a very greedy fellow.  He eats nearly all the time.  I  could not begin to tell you how many insects I have eaten during my  life.    \"There are cutworms, too, which live underground.  During the night  they come out for food.  We robins are early risers, and often catch  the slow worms before they can get back to their underground homes.\"    \"Ah,\" laughed Phyllis, \"that must be the reason that we say that the  early bird catches the worm.\"    \"When our babies come,\" said the robin, \"we are very busy, indeed.  Those young mouths seem always to be open, begging for more food.    \"My mother says that when I was a baby robin she was kept busy all day  long.    \"There were four baby birds in the nest.  I myself ate about seventy  worms in a day.  My brother and sisters had as good appetites as I.\"    \"Will you build here in the apple-tree?\" asked Phyllis.  \"I should so  like to watch you.  Besides, there is a garden just beneath with  millions of bugs and insects there.\"    \"Oh, yes,\" replied the robin.  \"We shall surely build there.  You will  find that robins like to build near your home.  We have a very friendly  feeling towards people.  That is the reason that we hop about your lawn  so much and that we waken you by singing near your window in the early  morning.\"    \"I have heard that robins are not very good nest-builders,\" said  Phyllis.  \"I was told that a great number of robins' nests were blown  down by every hard storm.\"    \"More are destroyed than I like to think about,\" said the robin.  \"But  my father and mother raised three families of birds in their nest last  season.    \"Early in the spring they were very busy about their nest-building.  First they brought sticks, straw, weeds, and roots.  With these they  laid the foundation in what seemed a very careless fashion, among the  boughs.    \"Then here on this foundation they wove the round nest of straws and  weeds.  They plastered it with mud.  They lined it with soft grasses  and moss.    \"In this nest my mother laid four beautiful greenish-blue eggs.  From  the first egg that cracked open I crept out.  From the three other eggs  came my brother and sisters.    \"We were not handsome babies.  I don't believe bird babies ever are  beautiful at first.  We had no feathers, and our mouths were so big and  yellow.    \"We were always hungry, for we were growing very fast.  Our mouths flew  open at every little noise.  We thought every sound was the flutter of  our parents' wings.  They always brought such fine food for us.\"    The robin pecked away at his breakfast for some time before he spoke  again.  Then he again took up the story of his life.    \"How well I remember being taught to fly,\" he said.  \"How our mother  coaxed us to try our wings.  How timid and feeble we were One of my  sisters fell to the ground and a great gray cat caught her.    \"Our wings were very weak then and our feathers were still short.  I  then had no beautiful red breast.  It was just a rusty looking white  spotted with black.    \"My mother's breast was not so red as my father's.  She was of a paler  colour and she sang much less than he.  She was a very happy little  mother, however, and she chirped very sweetly to her babies.    \"After we flew from the nest, and were able to look out for ourselves,  my mother laid four more greenish-blue eggs in the same nest.  By and  bye four more young robins were chirping about in the garden.    \"Quite late in the season my parents were again nesting.  But it was  rather unfortunate that they did so.  A great storm came up and a  branch broke from the tree and destroyed the four blue eggs.    \"It was shortly after this mishap that the robins flew south for the  winter.    \"My brother, who was always a brave, cheery fellow, thought he would  rather stay here.  I wonder how he fared.  I have not yet seen him.\"    \"I have not seen him lately, but he was here during the winter,\" said  Phyllis.  \"I dare say you will find him soon.\"    \"Well,\" said the robin, picking up the last grain of wheat, \"I thank  you, Phyllis, for this fine breakfast.    \"I will only say 'good morning.'  I think you will see me again.  Perhaps I will show you where we build our nest.\"    \"I am grateful to you,\" replied Phyllis.  \"You see the cherry-tree  grows beside Jack's window.  You might have sung your morning song  there.\"          THE ROBIN'S RED BREAST[1]    It was very cold in the north country.  The ice was thick and the snow  was deep.    The seal and the white bear were happy.  They liked the ice, the snow,  and the cutting north wind, for their fur was thick and warm.    One night the great white bear climbed to the top of an immense  iceberg.  He looked far across the country.  The fields of snow and the  beautiful northern lights made the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20552"],[0,"Roumanian Fairy Tales (#3)"],[1,"as sound as an egg.    \"Good morning!\"    \"Good morning; but how did you sleep last night?\"    \"Very well,\" replied Stan. \"Only I dreamed that a flea bit me just  here on the forehead, and it seems as if it still pained me.\"    \"Just listen to that, mother!\" cried the dragon. \"Did you hear? He  talks about a flea, and I hit him with my club!\"    This was too much for the she-dragon. She perceived that it isn't  worth while to argue with such people. So they hastened to fill his  sacks, in order to get rid of him as quickly as possible. But poor  Stan now began to perspire. When he stood beside the bags, he trembled  like an aspen leaf, because he was unable to lift even one of them  from the ground. So he stood staring at them.    \"Why are you standing there?\" asked the dragon.    \"H'm! I'm waiting,\" replied Stan, \"because I would rather stay with  you another year. I'm ashamed to have any body see me carry away so  little at one time. I'm afraid people will say, 'Look at Stan Bolovan,  who in one year has grown as weak as a dragon.'\"    Now, it was the two dragons' turn to be frightened.    They vainly told him that they would give him seven--nay, three times  seven or even seven times seven--sacks of ducats, if he would only go  away.    \"I'll tell you what,\" said Stan, at last. \"As I see you don't want to  keep me, I won't force you to do so. Have it your own way. I'll go.  But, that I need not be ashamed before the people, you must carry this  treasure home for me.\"    The words were scarcely out of his mouth, when the dragon picked up  the sacks and set off with Stan.    Short and smooth, yet always too long, is the road that leads home.  But, when Stan found himself close to his house, and heard his  children's shouts, he began to walk slower. It seemed too near; for he  was afraid that, if the dragon knew where he lived, he might come to  take away the treasure. Only he was puzzled to find any way of  carrying his money home alone.    \"I really don't know what to do,\" he said, turning to the dragon. \"I  have a hundred hungry children, and fear you may fare badly among  them, because they are very fond of fighting. But just behave  sensibly, and I'll protect you as well as I can.\"    A hundred children! That's no joke! The dragon--though a dragon of  dragon race--let the bags fall in his fright. But, from sheer terror,  he picked them up again. Yet his fear did not gain the mastery till  they entered the court-yard. When the hungry children saw their father  coming with the loaded dragon, they rushed toward him, each one with a  knife in the right hand and a fork in the left. Then they all began to  whet the knives on the forks, shrieking at the top of their lungs, \"We  want dragon meat!\"    This was enough to scare Satan himself. The dragon threw down the  sacks, and then took to flight, so frightened that since that time he  has never dared to come back to the world.          The Wonderful Bird.      Once upon a time, something happened. If it had not happened, it would  not be told.    There was a good, pious emperor, who had three sons. Among many other  benefits bestowed upon the inhabitants of his empire he built a  church, about which marvelous stories were told, for he adorned it  with gold, precious stones and every thing the workmen of that country  regarded as beautiful and valuable. Within and in front of this church  were numbers of marble columns, and it was supplied with the finest  paintings, silver chandeliers, huge silver lamps, and the rarest  books. The more the emperor rejoiced in its beauty, the more sorrowful  he felt that he could not finish it, for the steeple continually fell  down.    \"How is it that this sacred church can not be completed?\" he asked. \"I  have spent all my property and it is not yet done.\" So he ordered a  proclamation to be sent throughout the empire, stating that any  architect who could finish the church steeple would receive great  gifts and honors. Besides this, a second proclamation was issued,  commanding prayers to be read and services held in all the churches,  that God might take pity on him and send him a good architect. The  third night the monarch dreamed that if any one would fetch the  wonderful bird from the other shore and put its nest in the steeple,  the church could be finished. He told this dream to his sons, and they  vied with each other in offering to set out and devote themselves to  their imperial father's service.    The emperor replied: \"I see, my sons, that you all desire to fulfill  your duty to God, but you can't all three go at once. My oldest son  shall set out first, if he does not succeed, the second one, and so on  until the Lord takes pity upon us.\"    The younger sons silently submitted; the oldest one made his  preparations for the journey. He traveled as best he could, and when  he had passed the frontiers of his father's empire, found himself in a  beautiful grove. After lighting a fire he stood waiting until his food  was cooked. Suddenly he saw a fox, which begged him to tie up his  hound, give it a bit of bread and a glass of wine, and let it rest by  his fire. Instead of granting the request the prince released the  hound, which instantly pursued the animal, whereupon the fox, by a  magic spell, transformed the emperor's son into a block of stone.    When the sovereign saw that his oldest son did not return, he listened  to the entreaties of his second son, and gave him permission to set  forth to find the wonderful bird. After making his preparations and  taking some provisions with him, this prince also departed. On the  spot where his brother had been turned to stone, the same thing  happened to him, because he also refused the fox's entreaties, and  tried to catch it, to get its skin.    The emperor grew very thoughtful, when after a long time his sons  failed to return, either with or without the wonderful bird.    At last the youngest said: \"You see, father, it is now a long time  since my brothers set out to find the wonderful bird, and they haven't  come home yet; give me some money and clothes for the journey that I  may try my luck also. If I succeed, you will rejoice, because your  dream will be fulfilled, and if I do not, you will suffer no  mortification from it.\"    \"Your older brothers have apparently been unable to get this wonderful  bird,\" replied the emperor; \"nay, perhaps they have even lost their  lives, they have been absent so long. I am old; if you go too, who  will help me in the cares of government; if I die, who is there to  ascend the throne except you, my son? Stay here, my dear child, do not  leave me.\"    \"You know, my royal father, that I have never swerved a hair's breadth  from your commands, and if I now venture to urge my petition it is  only because, if possible, I would fain fulfill a wish that gives you  no rest, which you have cherished so many years and striven to realize  at so great a cost.\"    After many entreaties, the emperor yielded. The prince chose from the  imperial stables a horse that pleased him, took a dog for a  companion, supplied himself with sufficient food and departed.    After some time had passed, the emperor's two older sons suddenly  arrived with the magic bird and a young girl, who was placed in charge  of the poultry-yard. Every body wondered at the beauty of the bird,  whose plumage glittered with a thousand hues, each feather shining  like the sun, and the church-steeple did not fall after the bird and  its nest were placed within. One thing, however, was noticed; the bird  seemed dumb, it never uttered a note, and all who saw it grieved that  so beautiful a creature should have no song; even the emperor, spite  of all the pleasure he took in the church and steeple, was sorrowful  because the bird did not sing.    People began to forget the youngest son, so great was the rejoicing  over the bird that seemed to keep the steeple from falling, and thus  enabled the workmen to finish the church; but the emperor grieved  because the prince was not there to share his subjects' pleasure.    One day the poultry-keeper came to him and said: \"May thy face shine,  mighty emperor, the whole city is marveling at the singing of the  magic bird--a shepherd entered the church early this morning, and the  bird instantly began to sing as if it would burst its throat, and is  so happy that it can hardly keep in its nest. This has happened to-day  for the second time. While the shepherd is in the church the bird  never stops singing, but as soon as he goes away, it is silent.\"    \"Let the shepherd be brought before me at once.\"    \"Your majesty, the shepherd seems to be a stranger; no one here knows  him. Your majesty's sons, I hear, have set guards to arrest him.\"    \"Silence,\" said the emperor; \"do not mention my sons; it is not seemly  for you to speak against them.\"    The sovereign sent some of his most trusty servants to keep watch,  seize the shepherd as soon as he entered the church and the bird began  to sing, and bring him before him. But, not content with this, he went  himself the next holiday to hear the bird's wonderful singing with his  own ears, and see the shepherd. If he had not been present, a violent  conflict would have arisen between his own people and the spies sent  by his sons, who evidently wished to lay hands on the shepherd. The  emperor ordered that he should be brought to the palace, for a strange  feeling stirred in his heart when he saw the timid youth with the  figure of a hero.    When he came out of church, the monarch went directly home to his  palace, for his heart told him that there must be something unusual  about this shepherd. On seeing him, he said:--    \"Tell me, my son, from what part of the country do you come? Have you  any parents, and how did you get here?\"    \"My story is a long one, most noble emperor. I have parents and  brothers. I shall need more time to tell you how I came hither, but if  it is your majesty'"]]]
