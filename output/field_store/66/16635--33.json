By Victor Mindeleff.             *       *       *       *       *      INTRODUCTION.      The remains of pueblo architecture are found scattered over thousands  of square miles of the arid region of the southwestern plateaus. This  vast area includes the drainage of the Rio Pecos on the east and that  of the Colorado on the west, and extends from central Utah on the north  beyond the limits of the United States southward, in which direction its  boundaries are still undefined.    The descendants of those who at various times built these stone  villages are few in number and inhabit about thirty pueblos distributed  irregularly over parts of the region formerly occupied. Of these the  greater number are scattered along the upper course of the Rio Grande  and its tributaries in New Mexico; a few of them, comprised within the  ancient provinces of Cibola and Tusayan, are located within the  drainage of the Little Colorado. From the time of the earliest Spanish  expeditions into the country to the present day, a period covering more  than three centuries, the former province has been often visited by  whites, but the remoteness of Tusayan and the arid and forbidding  character of its surroundings have caused its more complete isolation.  The architecture of this district exhibits a close adherence to  aboriginal practices, still bears the marked impress of its development  under the exacting conditions of an arid environment, and is but slowly  yielding to the influence of foreign ideas.    The present study of the architecture of Tusayan and Cibola embraces all  of the inhabited pueblos of those provinces, and includes a number of  the ruins traditionally connected with them. It will be observed by  reference to the map that the area embraced in these provinces comprises  but a small portion of the vast region over which pueblo culture once  extended.    This study is designed to be followed by a similar study of two typical  groups of ruins, viz, that of Canyon de Chelly, in northeastern Arizona,  and that of the Chaco Canyon, of New Mexico; but it has been necessary  for the writer to make occasional reference to these ruins in the  present paper, both in the discussion of general arrangement and  characteristic ground plans, embodied in Chapters II and III and in the  comparison by constructional details treated in Chapter IV, in order  to define clearly the relations of the various features of pueblo  architecture. They belong to the same pueblo system illustrated by the  villages of Tusayan and Cibola, and with the Canyon de Chelly group  there is even some trace of traditional connection, as is set forth by  Mr. Stephen in Chapter I. The more detailed studies of these ruins, to  be published later, together with the material embodied in the present  paper, will, it is thought, furnish a record of the principal  characteristics of an important type of primitive architecture, which,  under the influence of the arid environment of the southwestern  plateaus, has developed from the rude lodge into the many-storied  house of rectangular rooms. Indications of some of the steps of this  development are traceable even in the architecture of the present day.    The pueblo of Zuñi was surveyed by the writer in the autumn of 1881  with a view to procuring the necessary data for the construction of a  large-scale model of this pueblo. For this reason the work afforded a  record of external features only.    The modern pueblos of Tusayan were similarly surveyed in the following  season (1882-'83), the plans being supplemented by photographs, from  which many of the illustrations accompanying this paper have been drawn.  The ruin of Awatubi was also included in the work of this season.    In the autumn of 1885 many of the ruined pueblos of Tusayan were  surveyed and examined. It was during this season's work that the details  of the kiva construction, embodied in the last chapter of this paper,  were studied, together with interior details of the dwellings. It was in  the latter part of this season that the farming pueblos of Cibola were  surveyed and photographed.    The Tusayan farming pueblo of Moen-kopi and a number of the ruins in the  province were surveyed and studied in the early part of the season of  1887-'88, the latter portion of which season was principally devoted to  an examination of the Chaco ruins in New Mexico.    In the prosecution of the field work above outlined the author has been  greatly indebted to the efficient assistance and hearty cooperation of  Mr. Cosmos Mindeleff, by whom nearly all the pueblos illustrated, with  the exception of Zuñi, have been surveyed and platted.    The plans obtained have involved much careful work with surveying  instruments, and have all been so platted as faithfully to record the  minute variations from geometric forms which are so characteristic of  the pueblo work, but which have usually been ignored in the hastily  prepared sketch plans that have at times appeared. In consequence of  the necessary omission of just such information in hastily drawn plans,  erroneous impressions have been given regarding the degree of skill to  which the pueblo peoples had attained in the planning and building of  their villages. In the general distribution of the houses, and in the  alignment and arrangement of their walls, as indicated in the plans  shown in Chapters II and III, an absence of high architectural  attainment is found, which is entirely in keeping with the lack of skill  apparent in many of the constructional devices shown in Chapter IV.      [Illustration:"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19870"],[0,"Illuminated Manuscripts (#3)"],[1,"and  illuminated books, it becomes necessary to explain what it is, and why  it was used instead of paper.    We often find writers, when referring to ancient documents, making use  of the words parchment and vellum as if the terms were synonymous; but  this is not strictly correct. It is true that both are prepared from  skins, but the skins are different. They are similar, but not the same,  nor, indeed, are they interchangeable. In point of fact, the skins of  almost all the well-known domestic animals, and even of fishes, have  been used for the purpose of making a material for writing upon.  Specifically among the skins so prepared were the following: the  ordinary lambskin, called \"aignellinus\"[2]; that prepared from stillborn  lambs, called \"virgin parchment.\"    [2] Strictly _agnellinus_.    From sheepskins was produced ordinary \"parchment,\" and also a sort of  leather called \"basane\" or \"cordovan.\" Vellum was produced from  calfskin; that of the stillborn calf being called \"uterine vellum,\" and  considered the finest and thinnest. It is often spoken of in connection  with the exquisitely written Bibles of the thirteenth and fourteenth  centuries as of the highest value.    Besides these were the prepared skins of oxen, pigs, and asses; but  these were chiefly used for bindings, though occasionally for leaves of  account and other books liable to rough usage.    Before the tenth century the vellum used for MSS. is highly polished,  and very white and fine. Afterwards it becomes thick and rough,  especially on the hair side. In the examination of certain MSS. the  distinction of hair side and smooth side is of importance in counting  the gatherings so as to determine the completeness, or otherwise, of a  given volume. Towards the period of the Renaissance, however, the vellum  gradually regains its better qualities.    Thus it may be seen that the difference between vellum and parchment is  not a mere difference of thickness; for while, in general, vellum is  stouter than parchment, there is some vellum which is thinner than some  parchment. Not only are they made from different kinds of skin, but the  vellum used for illuminated books was, and still is, prepared with  greater care than the parchment used for ordinary school or college  treatises, or legal documents.    The fabrication of both parchment and vellum in the Middle Ages was  quite as important a matter as that of paper at the present time, and  certain monastic establishments had a special reputation for the  excellence of their manufacture. Thus the \"parcheminerie,\" as it was  called, of the Abbey of Cluny, in France, was quite celebrated in the  twelfth century. One reason probably for this celebrity was the fact  that Cluny had more than three hundred churches, colleges, and  monasteries amongst its dependencies, and therefore had ample  opportunities for obtaining the best materials and learning the best  methods in use throughout literary Christendom. As to the name \"vellum,\"  it is directly referable to the familiar Latin term for the hide or pelt  of the sheep or other animal, but specially applied, as we have said, to  that of the calf, the writing material thus prepared being termed  _charta vitulina_--in French _vélin_, and in monastic Latin and English  _vellum_.    The name \"parchment\" had quite a different kind of origin. It is an old  story, found in Pliny's _Natural History_ (bk. xiii. ch. 70), that the  ancient use or revival of the use of parchment was due to the  determination of King Eumenes II. of Mysia or Pergamos to form a library  which should rival those of Alexandria, but that when he applied to  Egypt for papyrus, the writing materials then in use, Ptolemy Epiphanes  jealously refused to permit its exportation. In this difficulty Eumenes,  we are told, had recourse to the preparation of sheepskins, and that  from the place of its invention it was called _charta pergamena_.    Pliny and his authority, however, were both wrong in point of history.  Eumenes, who reigned from about 197 to 158 B.C., was not the inventor,  but the restorer of its use (see Herodotus, v. 58). It was called in  Greek {~GREEK SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON~}{~GREEK  SMALL LETTER MU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER  RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH TONOS~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER  NU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA~} (2 Tim. iv. 13).    We may mention, by the way, that neither vellum nor parchment are by any  means the oldest materials known. Far older, and more generally used in  Italy, Greece, and Egypt, was the material which has given us the name  of our commonest writing material of to-day, viz. paper. The name of  this older material was _papyrus_ (Gr. {~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK  SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH TONOS~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER PI~}{~GREEK SMALL  LETTER UPSILON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER  OMICRON~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA~} and {~GREEK SMALL LETTER  CHI~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA WITH TONOS~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER  RHO~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU~}{~GREEK SMALL LETTER ETA~}{~GREEK SMALL  LETTER FINAL SIGMA~}). As a writing material it was known in Egypt from  remote antiquity. It was plentiful in Rome in the time of the Cæsars,  and it continued, both in Grecian and Roman Egypt, to be the ordinary  material employed down to the middle of the tenth century of our era. In  Europe, too, it continued in common use long after vellum had been  adopted for books, though more especially for letters and accounts. St.  Jerome mentions vellum as an alternative material in case papyrus should  fail (Ep. vii.), and St. Augustine (Ep. xv.) apologises for using vellum  instead of papyrus.[3] Papyrus was also used in the early Middle Ages.  Examples, _made up into book-form_--_i.e._ in leaves, with sometimes a  few vellum leaves among them for stability--are still extant. Among such  are some seven or eight books in various European libraries, the best  known being the Homilies of St. Avitus at Paris, the Antiquities of  Josephus at Milan, and the Isidore at St. Gall.    [3] Thompson, _Greek and Latin Palæography_, p. 33.    And in the Papal Chancery papyrus appears to have been used down to a  late date in preference to vellum.[4]    [4] Thompson, _op. cit._, p. 34; Aug. Molinier, _Les Manuscrits_,  Prélim.; Lecoy de la Marche, _Les MSS. et la Miniature_, p. 24.    In France papyrus was in common use in the sixth and seventh centuries.  Merovingian documents dating from 625 to 692 are still preserved in  Paris.

Seeing that illumination grew originally out of the decoration of the  initial letters, our next point to notice is the penmanship. The  alphabet which we now use is that formerly used by the Romans, who  borrowed it from the Greeks, who in turn obtained it (or their  modification of it) from the Phoenicians, who, lastly it is said,  constructed it from that of the Egyptians. Of course, in these repeated  transfers the letters themselves, as well as the order of them,  underwent considerable alterations. With these we have here no concern.  Our alphabet, _i.e._ the Roman and its variations, is quite sufficient  for our story. In order to show as clearly as may be the varieties of  lettering and the progress of penmanship from classical times to the  revival of the old Roman, letters in the fifteenth century, we offer the  following synopsis, which classifies and indicates the development of  the different hands used by writers and illuminators of MSS. It is  constructed on the information given in Wailly's large work on  Palæography, and in Dr. de Grey Birch's book on the Utrecht Psalter. The  former work affords excellent facsimiles, which, together with those  given in the plates published by the Palæographical Society, will give  the student the clearest possible ideas respecting these ancient  handwritings.    Omitting the cursive or correspondence hand, the letters used by the  Romans were of four kinds--capitals (usually made angular to be cut in  stone), rustic, uncials, and minuscules.    The rounded capitals were intended to be used in penwork. Uncials differ  from capitals only in the letters A, D, E, G, M, Q, T, V, for the sake  of ease in writing. It is said that this class of letters was first  called uncials from being made an inch (_uncia_) high, but this is mere  tradition; the word is first used on Jerome's preface to the Book of  Job. No uncials have ever been found measuring more than five-eighths of  an inch in height.    For the assistance of such students as may wish for examples we must  refer to certain MSS. and reproductions in which the foregoing hands are  exemplified.    _CIRCA_ FOURTH CENTURY.    _Capitals_, yet not pure.    The Vatican Vergil, No. 3225, throughout (Birch, p. 14; Silvestre's      _Paléographie universelle_, pl. 74).    With regard to the relative antiquity of capitals and uncials, M. de  Wailly observes: \"The titles in pure uncials, but less than the text  itself, give an excellent index to the highest antiquity. This is  verified in MSS. 152, 2630, 107 of the Bibl. du Roi, etc. MSS. of the  seventh or eighth century, whether on uncial or demi-uncial, or any  other letter, are never constant in noting the title at the top of the  page, or the kind of writing will vary, or if uncials be constantly  used, the titles will not be smaller than the text. These variations  become still greater in the following centuries. The ornaments which  relieve the titles of each page commence about the eighth century\" (i.  p. 49 C).    _Capitals_ and _Uncials_.    The Homilies of St. Augustine (Silvestre, pl. 74).
