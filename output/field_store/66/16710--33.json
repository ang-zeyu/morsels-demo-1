I waited all day without  news of him.  That night, on the advice of the manager of the hotel, I  communicated with the police, and next morning we advertised in all the  papers.  Our inquiries led to no result; and from that day to this no  word has ever been heard of my unfortunate father.  He came home with  his heart full of hope, to find some peace, some comfort, and  instead--\"  She put her hand to her throat, and a choking sob cut short  the sentence.    \"The date?\" asked Holmes, opening his note-book.    \"He disappeared upon the 3d of December, 1878,--nearly ten years ago.\"    \"His luggage?\"    \"Remained at the hotel.  There was nothing in it to suggest a  clue,--some clothes, some books, and a considerable number of  curiosities from the Andaman Islands.  He had been one of the officers  in charge of the convict-guard there.\"    \"Had he any friends in town?\"    \"Only one that we know of,--Major Sholto, of his own regiment, the 34th  Bombay Infantry.  The major had retired some little time before, and  lived at Upper Norwood.  We communicated with him, of course, but he  did not even know that his brother officer was in England.\"    \"A singular case,\" remarked Holmes.    \"I have not yet described to you the most singular part.  About six  years ago--to be exact, upon the 4th of May, 1882--an advertisement  appeared in the Times asking for the address of Miss Mary Morstan and  stating that it would be to her advantage to come forward.  There was  no name or address appended.  I had at that time just entered the  family of Mrs. Cecil Forrester in the capacity of governess.  By her  advice I published my address in the advertisement column.  The same  day there arrived through the post a small card-board box addressed to  me, which I found to contain a very large and lustrous pearl.  No word  of writing was enclosed.  Since then every year upon the same date  there has always appeared a similar box, containing a similar pearl,  without any clue as to the sender.  They have been pronounced by an  expert to be of a rare variety and of considerable value.  You can see  for yourselves that they are very handsome.\"  She opened a flat box as  she spoke, and showed me six of the finest pearls that I had ever seen.    \"Your statement is most interesting,\" said Sherlock Holmes.  \"Has  anything else occurred to you?\"    \"Yes, and no later than to-day.  That is why I have come to you. This  morning I received this letter, which you will perhaps read for  yourself.\"    \"Thank you,\" said Holmes.  \"The envelope too, please.  Postmark,  London, S.W.  Date, July 7.  Hum!  Man's thumb-mark on  corner,--probably postman.  Best quality paper.  Envelopes at sixpence  a packet.  Particular man in his stationery.  No address.  'Be at the  third pillar from the left outside the Lyceum Theatre to-night at seven  o'clock.  If you are distrustful, bring two friends.  You are a wronged  woman, and shall have justice.  Do not bring police.  If you do, all  will be in vain.  Your unknown friend.'  Well, really, this is a very  pretty little mystery. What do you intend to do, Miss Morstan?\"    \"That is exactly what I want to ask you.\"    \"Then we shall most certainly go.  You and I and--yes, why, Dr. Watson  is the very man.  Your correspondent says two friends.  He and I have  worked together before.\"    \"But would he come?\" she asked, with something appealing in her voice  and expression.    \"I should be proud and happy,\" said I, fervently, \"if I can be of any  service.\"    \"You are both very kind,\" she answered.  \"I have led a retired life,  and have no friends whom I could appeal to.  If I am here at six it  will do, I suppose?\"    \"You must not be later,\" said Holmes.  \"There is one other point,  however.  Is this handwriting the same as that upon the pearl-box  addresses?\"    \"I have them here,\" she answered, producing half a dozen pieces of  paper.    \"You are certainly a model client.  You have the correct intuition.  Let us see, now.\"  He spread out the papers upon the table, and gave  little darting glances from one to the other. \"They are disguised  hands, except the letter,\" he said, presently, \"but there can be no  question as to the authorship. See how the irrepressible Greek e will  break out, and see the twirl of the final s.  They are undoubtedly by  the same person. I should not like to suggest false hopes, Miss  Morstan, but is there any resemblance between this hand and that of  your father?\"    \"Nothing could be more unlike.\"    \"I expected to hear you say so.  We shall look out for you, then, at  six.  Pray allow me to keep the papers.  I may look into the matter  before then.  It is only half-past three.  Au revoir, then.\"    \"Au revoir,\" said our visitor, and, with a bright, kindly glance from  one to the other of us, she replaced her pearl-box in her bosom and  hurried away.  Standing at the window, I watched her walking briskly  down the street, until the gray turban and white feather were but a  speck in the sombre crowd.    \"What a very attractive woman!\" I exclaimed, turning to my companion.    He had lit his pipe again, and was leaning back with drooping eyelids.  \"Is she?\" he said, languidly.  \"I did not observe.\"    \"You really are an automaton,--a calculating-machine!\" I cried. \"There  is something positively inhuman in you at times.\"    He smiled gently.  \"It is of the first importance,\" he said, \"not to  allow your judgment to be biased by personal qualities.  A client is to  me a mere unit,--a factor in a problem.  The emotional qualities are  antagonistic to clear reasoning.  I assure you that the most winning  woman I ever knew was hanged for poisoning three little children for  their insurance-money, and the most repellant man of my acquaintance is  a philanthropist who has spent nearly a quarter of a million upon the  London poor.\"    \"In this case, however--\"    \"I never make exceptions.  An exception disproves the rule.  Have you  ever had occasion to study character in handwriting?  What do you make  of this fellow's scribble?\"    \"It is legible and regular,\" I answered.  \"A man of business habits and  some force of character.\"    Holmes shook his head.  \"Look at his long letters,\" he said. \"They  hardly rise above the common herd.  That d might be an a, and that l an  e.  Men of character always differentiate their long letters, however  illegibly they may write.  There is vacillation in his k's and  self-esteem in his capitals.  I am going out now.  I have some few  references to make.  Let me recommend this book,--one of the most  remarkable ever penned.  It is Winwood Reade's 'Martyrdom of Man.'  I  shall be back in an hour.\"    I sat in the window with the volume in my hand, but my thoughts were  far from the daring speculations of the writer.  My mind ran upon our  late visitor,--her smiles, the deep rich tones of her voice, the  strange mystery which overhung her life.  If she were seventeen at the  time of her father's disappearance she must be seven-and-twenty now,--a  sweet age, when youth has lost its self-consciousness and become a  little sobered by experience.  So I sat and mused, until such dangerous  thoughts came into my head that I hurried away to my desk and plunged  furiously into the latest treatise upon pathology.  What was I, an army  surgeon with a weak leg and a weaker banking-account, that I should  dare to think of such things?  She was a unit, a factor,--nothing more.  If my future were black, it was better surely to face it like a man  than to attempt to brighten it by mere will-o'-the-wisps of the  imagination.        Chapter III    In Quest of a Solution    It was half-past five before Holmes returned.  He was bright, eager,  and in excellent spirits,--a mood which in his case alternated with  fits of the blackest depression.    \"There is no great mystery in this matter,\" he said, taking the cup of  tea which I had poured out for him.  \"The facts appear to admit of only  one explanation.\"    \"What! you have solved it already?\"    \"Well, that would be too much to say. I have discovered a suggestive  fact, that is all.  It is, however, VERY suggestive. The details are  still to be added.  I have just found, on consulting the back files of  the Times, that Major Sholto, of Upper Norword, late of the 34th Bombay  Infantry, died upon the 28th of April, 1882.\"    \"I may be very obtuse, Holmes, but I fail to see what this suggests.\"    \"No?  You surprise me.  Look at it in this way, then.  Captain Morstan  disappears.  The only person in London whom he could have visited is  Major Sholto.  Major Sholto denies having heard that he was in London.  Four years later Sholto dies.  WITHIN A WEEK OF HIS DEATH Captain  Morstan's daughter receives a valuable present, which is repeated from  year to year, and now culminates in a letter which describes her as a  wronged woman.  What wrong can it refer to except this deprivation of  her father?  And why should the presents begin immediately after  Sholto's death, unless it is that Sholto's heir knows something of the  mystery and desires to make compensation?  Have you any alternative  theory which will meet the facts?\"    \"But what a strange compensation!  And how strangely made!  Why, too,  should he write a letter now, rather than six years ago? Again, the  letter speaks of giving her justice.  What justice can she have?  It is  too much to suppose that her father is still alive.  There is no other  injustice in her case that you know of.\"    \"There are difficulties; there are certainly difficulties,\" said  Sherlock Holmes, pensively.  \"But our expedition of to-night will solve  them all.  Ah, here is a four-wheeler, and Miss Morstan is inside.  Are  you all ready?  Then we had better go down, for it is a little past the  hour.\"    I picked up my hat and my heaviest stick, but I observed that Holmes  took"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20987"],[0,"Story of the War in South Africa, 1899-1900 (#3)"],[1,"scenes of operations, labours  under two disadvantages. The port of Durban is not under all  circumstances safe for large vessels to enter, and there is therefore  in the facilities for landing goods an inferiority to Cape Town. The  country, too, is more difficult, the obstacles to movement, which also  favour defence, increasing as the frontier is approached, and  culminating on the borders of the Free State and the Transvaal. Being  thus nearer, the latter are here better able to concentrate and  sustain opposition than they are on the western flank.    \"The mountains which on the edge of Basutoland rise to a height of ten  thousand feet,\" writes Mr. Bryce, \"break down toward Natal in  tremendous precipices. Near Ladysmith the frontier of the Orange Free  State coincides with a high watershed, crossed by only a few  passes.\"[2] Where this boundary between {p.018} Natal and the Free  State ends, that of the Transvaal begins, and soon after turns sharply  to the southward, the new direction forming with the old a very acute  angle, with apex to the north. Here, just within the territory of  Natal, is Majuba Hill, whose name has been in the mouths of all men,  and Laing's Nek, less familiarly known. The narrow neck of rugged  country embraced between the legs of this angle is about sixty miles  long, from Majuba to Glencoe. Recent events have familiarised to us  many of the names along this line of rail--Glencoe, Dundee (the  terminus of a short branch), Colenso, Estcourt, and Ladysmith itself;  while the winding character of the track, as mapped, compared with the  Free State road, sufficiently indicates the character of the country,  in which obstacles have to be circumvented as well as overcome. The  grade is in places as high as one in thirty, though that is being  reduced; but one in forty is common. Pietermaritzburg, the capital,  fifty miles from Durban in a straight line, is 2,200 feet above the  sea. Three hundred miles from its starting-point the road {p.019}  reaches an elevation of over five thousand feet, at Laing's Nek,  through which it passes by a tunnel.                       [Footnote 2: \"Impressions of South Africa.\" Third                     Edition, p. 291.]    A topographical map of the country shows upon examination that the  mountain range, which forms the western boundary of Natal toward  Basutoland and the Orange Free State, and has a general north and  south direction parallel to the railroad, throws off to the eastward  spurs which, to repeat Mr. Bryce's expression, \"break down in  tremendous precipices,\" forming a succession of terraces. The gorges  between these determine the direction of the river-beds whereby the  rainfall pours down to the sea; and the general easterly course thus  imparted is maintained and continued by the lie of the valleys,  separating the successive hills through which the territory of Natal  gradually rises to the northward. These various streams find their way  sooner or later to the Tugela, itself one of the many, but which  carries its own name until it reaches the Indian Ocean, some fifty  miles north-east of Durban.    Of these watercourses, the Tugela, which the road crosses at Colenso,  and the Mooi, some {p.020} fifty miles south, have been most often  mentioned. Another tributary called the Klip flows through the camp at  Ladysmith. The channels which these streams have cut for themselves in  time of torrent are both steep-banked and deep. They are therefore  among those accidents of the ground which, duly improved, can  seriously affect military operations. The destruction of a bridge  impedes the transport of troops and supplies; a sudden freshet,  occurring in the midst of an extensive movement, may imperil an army  by sundering its forces; while of the utility of such natural trenches  to the purposes of shelter and of defence, of awaiting attack, or  resisting an advance, both the Tugela and Paardeberg have given recent  striking illustration.    As a general rule such conditions favour the defence relatively to the  offence; the former, remaining comparatively motionless, is shielded  by obstacles, to surmount which the assailant must expose himself in  the open. Thus they compensate for inferior numbers, which is usually  the condition of the defence; and they conduce to delay, ever a  leading object in defensive warfare. Consequently, in the {p.021}  present hostilities they have helped the Boers. It may be added that  their influence is most felt when the armies are face to face, or at  least in touch. Hence their existence near the scene of probable  conflict, as in Natal, is a matter of more concern to the invader than  when, as upon the Cape extreme of the scene of war, they are found  beyond the range to which the defendant can safely extend his  operations.    These successive watercourses indicate natural lines of defence,  stronger or weaker according to their individual distinctive features.  As the railroad, in its progress north, draws near the mountains in  the neck of Natal, the streams show smaller volume and less developed  channels. This comes from their having there a shorter course and  descending from heights which, though still considerable, are  decidedly lower. But, while the streams become less conspicuous as  obstacles, the ground toward the northward frontier is more broken and  irregular, presenting numerous scattered hills, sometimes isolated,  sometimes in small ranges or groups, which to a trained military skill  afford positions too {p.022} threatening to be disregarded, and yet  which cannot be carried without heavy loss. This characteristic is  observable in the neighbourhood of Glencoe, Dundee, and Ladysmith,  and, as will be seen, exercised a determinative influence upon the  fighting.    In the extreme north a similar condition is emphasized conspicuously  at Majuba Hill and the surrounding country, which, however, and  perhaps for that very reason, seem unlikely to play much of a part in  the war now current.    Before proceeding to the narrative of the hostilities which, so far as  events of decisive interest are concerned, began in Natal, it is  desirable to note one broad topographical feature distinguishing the  region to which, in its eastern development, the war has been  confined. From the capital, Pietermaritzburg, the railroad ascends  rapidly, so that in twenty-five miles it has risen from 2,200 to 4,800  feet, after which it begins again to go down, till fifty miles  further, at Estcourt--the most southern of the stations prominently  named in the narratives of the war--the elevation is 3,800 feet.  Thence, till near Glencoe and Dundee, {p.023} there is an extensive  area of comparative depression, rarely itself higher than 3,500 feet,  but on the western side skirted by the precipitous spurs of the border  mountains, close to which the railroad passes.    This district may be called the valley of the Tugela; for all the  streams tend to the latter, which finds its own bed in a broad belt of  ground, trending to the eastward, where the surface sinks to less than  3,000 feet. Ladysmith itself, important not only as a railroad  crossing and military depot, but now also historically, on account of  the operations centring around it, is at a height of 3,300. Beyond it  the country, though often rough in detail, is gently rolling in  general contour till near Glencoe, where the road climbs eight hundred  feet in ten miles. From Glencoe a branch runs five miles east to  Dundee, the site of extensive collieries, upon which Natal largely  depends for fuel.    The railroad from Ladysmith to Glencoe passes therefore through a  district the nature of which is favourable to rapid advance or retreat  of mounted men, as the Boer forces chiefly are, and which at the same  time is marked {p.024} by frequent and steep detached elevations,  adapted for defensive positions hastily assumed. These conditions,  with the nearness of the declivities of the western mountains, and the  proximity of the enemy's frontier, behind which movements of troops  would be \"curtained\"--to use a graphic military metaphor--gave the  Boers particular facilities for striking unexpectedly the railroad  between Ladysmith and Glencoe, upon which, in defect of other  transportation, the two British posts must depend for communication  between themselves, and with their base on the sea.    Further to the south, movements of the same kind would be decisively  more difficult. Not only would the Boers there be further from their  base, and the British nearer theirs, but the country is less  favourable to rapid horse movements, the line of the rail is  contracted by lofty and continuous ranges of hills, the space between  which gives but a narrow front to be covered by a defence, and the  river beds, as already said, are broader and deeper; notably, of  course, the Tugela. Moreover, not only are the mountains on the  western frontier higher and more difficult as one {p.025} goes south,  they are also more remote; and, south of Colenso, form the boundary of  Basutoland, upon which the Boers could not intrude without arousing  armed resistance by the blacks. All these conditions are more  favourable to a pure defensive attitude, which was that imposed at the  outset upon the British, because they were then numerically the weaker  party.    And here at once must be made a distinction, which for intelligent  comprehension it is essential to keep in mind. Putting entirely to one  side all question of the merits of the quarrel--of its right or its  wrong--it must be steadily remembered that, although the comparative  aggregate strength of the two parties placed the Boers from the first  on the defensive in the general sense, they were at the beginning of  hostilities decisively superior in local force, and would so remain  until sufficient reinforcements from Great Britain should arrive to  turn the scale.
