So now she'll have to starve to  death for all of me!\"    \"Me, too!\" said Jakov, the second son. \"When I tried to tell her that  funny story of how I traded the moldy oats for the old widow's fat pig,  instead of laughing she looked me straight in the face and said:  'Cheat!'\"    \"Stefan ought to go,\" Mihailo suggested. \"Maybe she'd laugh at him!  Everybody else does!\"    He spoke sneeringly but Stefan only smiled.    \"Who knows? Perhaps I will go. If I do make her laugh then, O my  brothers, the laugh will be on you for I shall become Tsar and you two  will be known as my two poor brothers. Ho! Ho! Ho! What a joke that  would be!\"    Stefan laughed loud and heartily and his little sister joined him, but  his brothers looked at him sourly.    \"He grows more foolish all the time!\" they told each other.    When they were gone to bed, Militza slipped over to Stefan and whispered  in his ear:    \"Brother, you must go to the Princess. Tell her the story that begins:  _In my young days when I was an old, old man_.... I think she'll just  have to laugh, and if she laughs then she can eat and she must be very  hungry by this time.\"    At first Stefan said no, he wouldn't go, but Militza insisted and  finally, to please her, he said he would.    So early the next morning he dressed himself in his fine Sunday shirt  with its blue and red embroidery. He put on his bright red Sunday sash  and his long shiny boots. Then he mounted his horse and before his  brothers were awake rode off to the Tsar's castle.    There he awaited his turn to be admitted to the Princess's chamber. When  he came in he was so young and healthy and vigorous that he seemed to  bring with him a little of the freshness of outdoors. The first  lady-in-waiting looked at him askance for without doubt he was a farmer  lad and his table manners probably were not good. Well, he was a farmer  lad and for that reason he didn't know that she was first  lady-in-waiting. He glanced at her once and thought: \"What an ugly old  woman!\" and thereafter he didn't think of her at all. He glanced  likewise at the Tsar and the Tsar reminded him of a bull of his own. He  wasn't afraid of the bull, so why be afraid of the Tsar?    Suddenly he saw the Princess lying in bed with her lovely hair spread  out on the pillow like a golden fan and for a moment he couldn't speak.  Then he knelt beside the bed and kissed her hand.    \"Princess,\" he said, \"I'm not learned and I'm not clever and I don't  suppose I can succeed where so many wise men have failed. And even if I  do make you laugh you won't have to marry me unless you want to because  the reason I really came was to please Militza.\"    \"Militza?\"    \"Yes, Princess, my little sister, Militza. She loves me very much and so  she thinks the stories I tell are funny and she laughs at them. Last  night she said to me: 'Stefan, you must go to the Princess and tell her  the story that begins: _In my young days when I was an old, old  man_.... I think she'll just have to laugh and if she laughs then she  can eat and she must be very hungry by this time.'\"    \"I am,\" the Princess said, with a catch in her voice. Then she added: \"I  think I like that little sister of yours and I think I like you, too. I  wish you would tell me the story that begins: _In my young days when I  was an old, old man_....\"    \"But, Princess, it's a very foolish story.\"    \"The foolisher, the better!\"    Just here the first lady-in-waiting tried to correct the Princess for of  course she should have said: \"The more foolish, the better!\" but the  Tsar shut her up with a black frown and one fierce, \"Wow!\"    \"Well, then,\" Stefan began:    _In my young days when I was an old, old man I used to count my bees  every morning. It was easy enough to count the bees but not the beehives  because I had too many hives. One day when I finished counting I found  that my best bee was missing. At once I saddled a rooster and set out to  find him._    \"Father!\" cried the Princess. \"Did you hear what Stefan said? He said he  saddled his rooster!\"    \"Umph!\" muttered the Tsar, and the first lady-in-waiting said severely:    \"Princess, do not interrupt! Young man, continue.\"    _His track led to the sea which I rode across on a bridge. The first  thing I saw on the other side of the sea was my bee. There he was in a  field of millet harnessed to a plow. \"That's my bee!\" I shouted to the  man who was driving him. \"Is that so?\" the man said, and without any  words he gave me back my bee and handed me a bag of millet to pay for  the plowing. I took the bag and tied it securely on the bee. Then I  unsaddled the rooster and mounted the bee. The rooster, poor thing, was  so tired that I had to take him by the hand and lead him along beside  us._    \"Father!\" the Princess cried, \"did you hear that? He took the rooster by  the hand! Isn't that funny!\"    \"Umph!\" grunted the Tsar, and the first lady-in-waiting whispered:    \"Hush! Let the young man finish!\"    _Whilst we were crossing the bridge, the string of the bag broke and all  my millet spilled out. When night came I tied the rooster to the bee and  lay down on the seashore to sleep. During the night some wolves came  and killed my bee and when I woke up I found that all the honey had run  out of his body. There was so much honey that it rose up and up until it  reached the ankles of the valleys and the knees of the mountains. I took  a hatchet and swam down to a forest where I found two deer leaping about  on one leg. I shot at the deer with my hatchet, killed them, and skinned  them. With the skins I made two leather bottles. I filled these with the  honey and strapped them over the rooster's back. Then I rode home. I no  sooner arrived home than my father was born. \"We must have holy water  for the christening,\" I said. \"I suppose I must go to heaven to fetch  some.\" But how was I to get there? I thought of my millet. Sure enough  the dampness had made it grow so well that its tops now reached the sky.  So all I had to do was to climb a millet stalk and there I was in  heaven. Up there they had mown down some of my millet which they baked  into a loaf and were eating with boiled milk. \"That's my millet!\" I  said. \"What do you want for it?\" they asked me. \"I want some holy water  to christen my father who has just been born.\" So they gave me some holy  water and I prepared to descend again to earth. But on earth there was a  violent storm going on and the wind carried away my millet. So there I  was with no way of getting down. I thought of my hair. It was so long  that when I stood up it covered my ears and when I lay down it reached  all the way to earth. So I pulled out a hair, tied it to a tree of  heaven, and began descending by it. When it grew dark I made a knot in  the hair and just sat where I was. It was cold, so I took a needle which  I happened to have in my coat, split it up, and lighted a fire with the  chips._    \"Oh, father!\" the Princess cried, \"Stefan says he split a needle into  kindling wood! Isn't he funny!\"    \"If you ask me--\" the first lady-in-waiting began, but before she could  say more the Tsar reached over and stepped on her toe so hard that she  was forced to end her sentence with a little squeally, \"Ouch!\" The  Princess, you see, was smiling and the Tsar was hoping that presently  she would burst into a laugh. So he motioned Stefan to continue.    [Illustration: _Stefan Tells the Princess a Story_]    _Then I lay down beside the fire and fell asleep. While I slept a spark  from the fire fell on the hair and burned it through. I fell to earth  with such force that I sank into the ground up to my chest. I couldn't  budge, so I was forced to go home and get a spade and dig myself out. On  the way home I crossed a field_ _where the reapers were cutting corn.  The heat was so great that they had to stop work. \"I'll get our mare,\" I  said, \"and then you'll feel cooler.\" You know our mare is two days long  and as broad as midnight and she has willow trees growing on her back.  So I ran and got her and she cast such a cool shadow that the reapers  were at once able to go back to work. Now they wanted some fresh  drinking water, but when they went to the river they found it had frozen  over. They came back to me and asked me would I get them some water.  \"Certainly,\" I said. I went to the river myself, then I took off my head  and with it I broke a hole in the ice. After that it was easy enough to  fetch them some water. \"But where is your head?\" they asked. \"Oh!\" I  said, \"I must have forgotten it!\"_    \"Oh, father!\" the Princess cried with a loud laugh, \"he says he forgot  his head! Then, Stefan, what did you do? What did you do?\"    _I ran back to the river and got there just as a fox was sniffing at my  skull. \"Hi, there!\" I said, pulling the fox's tail. The fox turned  around and gave me a paper on which was written these words: =NOW THE  PRINCESS CAN EAT FOR SHE HAS LAUGHED AND STEFAN AND HIS LITTLE SISTER  ARE VERY HAPPY.=_    \"What nonsense!\" the first lady-in-waiting murmured with a toss of her  head.    \"Yes, beautiful nonsense!\" the Princess cried, clapping her hands and  going off into peal after peal of merry laughter. \"Isn't it beautiful  nonsense, father? And isn't Stefan a dear lad? And, father, I'm awfully  hungry! Please have some food sent in at once and Stefan must stay and  eat with me.\"    So the Tsar had great trays of food brought in: roast birds and  vegetables and wheaten bread and many kinds of little cakes and honey  and milk and fruit. And Stefan and the Princess ate and made merry and  the Tsar joined them and even the first lady-in-waiting took one little  cake which she crumbled in her handkerchief in a most refined manner.    Then Stefan rose to go and the Tsar said to him:    \"Stefan, I will reward you richly. You have made the Princess laugh and  besides you have not insisted on her marrying you. You are a fine lad  and I"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19714"],[0,"With Frederick the Great: A Story of the Seven Years' War (#3)"],[1,"olphus, and the service of the Protestant princes of Germany had  always been popular among them.    Then, her own cousin being a marshal in the Prussian army, it  seemed to Mrs. Drummond almost a matter of course, when the time  came, that Fergus should go to him; and she had, for many years,  devoted herself to preparing the lad for that service.  Nevertheless,  now that the time had come, she felt the parting no less sorely; but  she bore up well, and the sudden notice kept her fully occupied with  preparations, till the hour came for his departure.    Two of the men rode with him as far as Leith, and saw him on board  ship. Rudolph had volunteered to accompany him as servant, but his  mother had said to the lad:    \"It would be better not, Fergus. Of course you will have a soldier  servant, there, and there might be difficulties in having a  civilian with you.\"    It was, however, arranged that Rudolph should become a member of  the household. Being a handy fellow, a fair carpenter, and ready to  turn his hand to anything, there would be no difficulty in making  him useful about the farm.    Fergus had learnt, from him, the price at which he ought to be able  to buy a useful horse; and his first step, after landing at Stettin  and taking up his quarters at an inn, was to inquire the address of  a horse dealer. The latter found, somewhat to his surprise, that  the young Scot was a fair judge of a horse, and a close hand at  driving a bargain; and when he left, the lad had the satisfaction  of knowing that he was the possessor of a serviceable animal, and  one which, by its looks, would do him no discredit.    Three days later he rode into Berlin. He dismounted at a quiet inn,  changed his travelling dress for the new one that he carried in his  valise, and then, after inquiring for the palace, made his way  there.    He was struck by the number of soldiers in the streets, and with  the neatness, and indeed almost stiffness, of their uniform and  bearing. Each man walked as if on parade, and the eye of the  strictest martinet could not have detected a speck of dust on their  equipment, or an ill-adjusted strap or buckle.    \"I hope they do not brace and tie up their officers in that style,\"  Fergus said to himself.    He himself had always been accustomed to a loose and easy attire,  suitable for mountain work; and the high cravats and stiff collars,  powdered heads and pigtails, and tight-fitting garments, seemed to  him the acme of discomfort. It was not long, however, before he  came upon a group of officers, and saw that the military etiquette  was no less strict, in their case, than in that of the soldiers,  save that their collars were less high, and their stocks more easy.  Their walk, too, was somewhat less automatic and machine-like, but  they were certainly in strong contrast to the British officers he  had seen, on the occasions of his one or two visits to Perth.    On reaching the palace, and saying that he wished to see Marshal  Keith, he was conducted by a soldier to his apartment; and on the  former taking in the youth's name, he was at once admitted. The  marshal rose from his chair, came forward, and shook him heartily  by the hand.    \"So you are Fergus Drummond,\" he said, \"the son of my cousin  Maggie! Truly she lost no time in sending you off, after she got my  letter. I was afraid she might be long before she could bring  herself to part from you.\"    \"She had made up her mind to it so long, sir, that she was prepared  for it; and indeed, I think that she did her best to hurry me off  as soon as possible, not only because your letter was somewhat  urgent, but because it gave her less time to think.\"    \"That was right and sensible, lad, as indeed Maggie always was,  from a child.    \"She did not speak too strongly about you, for indeed I should have  taken you for fully two years older than you are. You have lost no  time in growing, lad, and if you lose no more in climbing, you will  not be long before you are well up the tree.    \"Now, sit you down, and let me first hear all about your mother,  and how she fares.\"    \"In the first place, sir, she charged me to give you her love and  affection, and to thank you for your good remembrance of her, and  for writing to her so often, when you must have had so many other  matters on your mind.\"    \"I was right glad when I heard that they had given her back  Kilgowrie. It is but a corner of your father's lands; but I  remember the old house well, going over there once, when I was  staying with your grandfather, to see his mother, who was then  living there. How much land goes with it?\"    \"About a thousand acres, but the greater part is moor and mountain.  Still, the land suffices for her to live on, seeing that she keeps  up no show, and lives as quietly as if she had never known anything  better.\"    \"Aye, she was ever of a contented spirit. I mind her, when she was  a tiny child; if no one would play with her, she would sit by the  hour talking with her dolls, till someone could spare time to perch  her on his shoulder, and take her out.\"    Marshal Keith was a tall man, with a face thoughtful in repose, but  having a pleasant smile, and an eye that lit up with quiet humour  when he spoke. He enjoyed the king's confidence to the fullest  extent, and was regarded by him not only as a general in whose  sagacity and skill he could entirely rely, but as one on whose  opinion he could trust upon all political questions. He was his  favourite companion when, as happened not unfrequently, he donned a  disguise and went about the town, listening to the talk of the  citizens and learning their opinions upon public affairs.    \"I have spoken to the king about your coming, lad, and told him  that you were a kinsman of mine.    \"'Indeed, marshal,' the king said, 'from what I can see, it appears  to me that all Scotchmen are more or less kin to each other.'    \"'It is so to some extent, your majesty. We Scotchmen pride  ourselves on genealogy, and know every marriage that has taken  place, for ages past, between the members of our family and those  of others; and claim as kin, even though very distant, all those  who have any of our blood running in their veins. But in this case  the kinship is close, the lad's mother being a first cousin of  mine. His father was killed at Culloden, and I promised her, as  soon as the news came to me, that when he had grown up strong and  hearty he should join me, wherever I might be, and should have a  chance of making his fortune by his sword.'    \"'You say that he speaks both French and German well? It is more  than I can do,' the king said with a laugh. 'German born and German  king as I am, I get on but badly when I try my native tongue, for  from a child I have spoken nothing but French. Still, it is well  that he should know the language. In my case it matters but little,  seeing that all my court and all my generals speak French. But one  who has to give orders to soldiers should be understood by them.    \"'Well, what do you want me to do for the lad?'    \"'I propose to make him one of my own aides-de-camp,' I replied,  'and therefore I care not so much to what regiment he is appointed;  though I own that I would far rather see him in the uniform of the  guards, than any other.'    \"'You are modest, marshal; but I observe that it is a common fault  among your countrymen. Well, which shall it be--infantry or  cavalry?'    \"'Cavalry, since you are good enough to give me the choice, sire.  The uniform looks better, for an aide-de-camp, than that of the  infantry.'    \"'Very well, then, you may consider him gazetted as a cornet, in my  third regiment of Guards. You have no more kinsmen coming at  present, Keith?'    \"'No, sire; not at present.'    \"'If many more come, I shall form them into a separate regiment.'    \"'Your majesty might do worse,' I said.    \"The king nodded. 'I wish I had half a dozen Scotch regiments; aye,  a score or two. They were the cream of the army of Gustavus  Adolphus, and if matters turn out as I fear they will, it would be  a welcome reinforcement.'    \"I will give you a note presently,\" continued the marshal, \"to a  man who makes my uniforms, so that I may present you to the king,  as soon as you are enrolled. You must remember that your favour, or  otherwise, with him will depend very largely upon the fit of your  uniform, and the manner in which you carry yourself. There is  nothing so unpardonable, in his eyes, as a slovenly and ill-fitting  dress. Everything must be correct, to a nicety, under all  circumstances. Even during hot campaigns, you must turn out in the  morning as if you came from a band box.    \"I will get Colonel Grunow, who commands your regiment, to tell off  an old trooper, one who is thoroughly up to his work, as your  servant. I doubt not that he may be even able to find you a  Scotchman, for there are many in the ranks--gentlemen who came over  after Culloden, and hundreds of brave fellows who escaped  Cumberland's harryings by taking ship and coming over here, where,  as they supposed, they would fight under a Protestant king.\"    \"But the king is a Protestant, is he not, sir?\"    \"He is nominally a Protestant, Fergus. Absolutely, his majesty has  so many things to see about that he does not trouble himself  greatly about religion. I should say that he was a disciple of  Voltaire, until Voltaire came here; when, upon acquaintance, he saw  through the vanity of the little Frenchman, and has been much less  enthusiastic about him since.    \"By the way, how did you come here?\"    \"We heard of a ship sailing for Stettin, and that hurried my  departure by some days. I made a good voyage there, and on landing  bought a horse and rode here.\"    \"Well, I am afraid your horse won't do to carry one of my  aides-de-camp, so you had best dispose of it, for what it will  fetch. I will mount you myself. His majesty was pleased to give me  two horses, the other day, and my"]]]
