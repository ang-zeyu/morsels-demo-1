If the monks deserved such reproaches from  posterity, they have received no quarter; if they possessed virtues as  christians, and honorable sentiments as men, they have met with no reward  in the praise or respect of this liberal age: they were monks!  superstitious priests and followers of Rome! What good could come of  them? It cannot be denied that there were crimes perpetrated by men  aspiring to a state of holy sanctity; there are instances to be met with  of priests violating the rules of decorum and morality; of monks  revelling in the dissipating pleasures of sensual enjoyments, and of nuns  whose frail humanity could not maintain the purity of their virgin vows.  But these instances are too rare to warrant the slanders and scurrility  that historians have heaped upon them. And when we talk of the sensuality  of the monks, of their gross indulgences and corporeal ease, we surely do  so without discrimination; for when we speak of the middle ages thus, our  thoughts are dwelling on the sixteenth century, its mocking piety and  superstitious absurdity; but in the olden time of monastic rule, before  monachism had burst its ancient boundaries, there was surely nothing  physically attractive in the austere and dull monotony of a cloistered  life. Look at the monk; mark his hard, dry studies, and his midnight  prayers, his painful fasting and mortifying of the flesh; what can we  find in this to tempt the epicure or the lover of indolence and sloth?  They were fanatics, blind and credulous--I grant it. They read gross  legends, and put faith in traditionary lies--I grant it; but do not say,  for history will not prove it, that in the middle ages the monks were  wine bibbers and slothful gluttons. But let not the Protestant reader be  too hastily shocked. I am not defending the monastic system, or the  corruption of the cloister--far from it. I would see the usefulness of  man made manifest to the world; but the measure of my faith teaches  charity and forgiveness, and I can find in the functions of the monk much  that must have been useful in those dark days of feudal tyranny and  lordly despotism. We much mistake the influence of the monks by mistaking  their position; we regard them as a class, but forget from whence they  sprang; there was nothing aristocratic about them, as their constituent  parts sufficiently testify; they were, perhaps, the best representatives  of the people that could be named, being derived from all classes of  society. Thus Offa, the Saxon king, and Caedman, the rustic herdsman, were  both monks. These are examples by no means rare, and could easily be  multiplied. Such being the case, could not the monks more readily feel  and sympathize with all, and more clearly discern the frailties of their  brother man, and by kind admonition or stern reproof, mellow down the  ferocity of a Saxon nature, or the proud heart of a Norman tyrant? But  our object is not to analyze the social influence of Monachism in the  middle ages: much might be said against it, and many evils traced to the  sad workings of its evil spirit, but still withal something may be said  in favor of it, and those who regard its influence in _those days alone_  may find more to admire and defend than they expected, or their  Protestant prejudices like to own.    But, leaving these things, I have only to deal with such remains as  relate to the love of books in those times. I would show the means then  in existence of acquiring knowledge, the scarcity or plentitude of books,  the extent of their libraries, and the rules regulating them; and bring  forward those facts which tend to display the general routine of a  literary monk, or the prevalence of Bibliomania in those days.    It is well known that the great national and private libraries of Europe  possess immense collections of manuscripts, which were produced and  transcribed in the monasteries, during the middle ages, thousands there  are in the rich alcoves of the Vatican at Rome, unknown save to a choice  and favored few; thousands there are in the royal library of France, and  thousands too reposing on the dusty shelves of the Bodleian and Cottonian  libraries in England; and yet, these numbers are but a small portion--a  mere relic--of the intellectual productions of a past and obscure  age.[7] The barbarians, who so frequently convulsed the more civilized  portions of Europe, found a morbid pleasure in destroying those works  which bore evidence to the mental superiority of their enemies. In  England, the Saxons, the Danes, and the Normans were each successively  the destroyers of literary productions. The Saxon Chronicle, that  invaluable repository of the events of so many years, bears ample  testimony to numerous instances of the loss of libraries and works of  art, from fire, or by the malice of designing foes. At some periods, so  general was this destruction, so unquenchable the rapacity of those who  caused it, that instead of feeling surprised at the manuscripts of those  ages being so few and scanty, we have cause rather to wonder that so many  have been preserved. For even the numbers which escaped the hands of the  early and unlettered barbarians met with an equally ignominious fate from  those for whom it would be impossible to hold up the darkness of their  age as a plausible excuse for the commission of this egregious folly.  These men over whose sad deeds the bibliophile sighs with mournful  regret, were those who carried out the Reformation, so glorious in its  results; but the righteousness of the means by which those results were  effected are very equivocal indeed. When men form themselves into a  faction and strive for the accomplishment of one purpose, criminal deeds  are perpetrated with impunity, which, individually they would blush and  scorn to do; they feel no direct responsibility, no personal restraint;  and, such as possess fierce passions, under the cloak of an organized  body, give them vent and gratification; and those whose better feelings  lead them to contemplate upon these things content themselves with the  conclusion, that out of evil cometh good.    The noble art of printing was unable, with all its rapid movements, to  rescue from destruction the treasures of the monkish age; the advocates  of the Reformation eagerly sought for and as eagerly destroyed those old  popish volumes, doubtless there was much folly, much exaggerated  superstition pervading them; but there was also some truth, a few facts  worth knowing, and perhaps a little true piety also, and it would have  been no difficult matter to have discriminated between the good and the  bad. But the careless grants of a licentious monarch conferred a  monastery on a court favorite or political partizan without one thought  for the preservation of its contents. It is true a few years after the  dissolution of these houses, the industrious Leland was appointed to  search and rummage over their libraries and to preserve any relic worthy  of such an honor; but it was too late, less learned hands had rifled  those parchment collections long ago, mutilated their finest volumes by  cutting out with childish pleasure the illuminations with which they were  adorned; tearing off the bindings for the gold claps which protected the  treasures within,[8] and chopping up huge folios as fuel for their  blazing hearths, and immense collections were sold as waste paper. Bale,  a strenuous opponent of the monks, thus deplores the loss of their books:  \"Never had we bene offended for the losse of our lybraryes beynge so many  in nombre and in so desolate places for the moste parte, yf the chief  monuments and moste notable workes of our excellent wryters had bene  reserved, yf there had bene in every shyre of Englande but one solemyne  library to the preservacyon of those noble workers, and preferrement of  good learnynges in oure posteryte it had bene yet somewhat. But to  destroye all without consyderacion, is and wyll be unto Englande for ever  a most horryble infamy amonge the grave senyours of other nations. A  grete nombre of them whych purchased those superstycyose mansyons  reserved of those lybrarye bokes, some to serve theyr jakes, some to  scoure theyr candelstyckes, and some to rubbe theyr bootes; some they  solde to the grossers and sope sellers, and some they sent over see to  the bokebynders,[9] not in small nombre, but at tymes _whole shippes  ful_. I know a merchant man, whyche shall at thys tyme be nameless, that  boughte the contents of two noble lybraryes for xl shyllyngs pryce, a  shame is it to be spoken. Thys stuffe hathe he occupyed in the stide of  graye paper for the space of more than these ten years, and yet hath  store ynough for as many years to come. A prodyguose example is this, and  to be abhorred of all men who love theyr natyon as they shoulde do.\"[10]    However pernicious the Roman religion might have been in its practice, it  argues little to the honor of the reformers to have used such means as  this to effect its cure; had they merely destroyed those productions  connected with the controversies of the day, we might perhaps have  excused it, on the score of party feeling; but those who were  commissioned to visit the public libraries of the kingdom were often men  of prejudiced intellects and shortsighted wisdom, and it frequently  happened that an ignorant and excited mob became the executioners of  whole collections.[11] It would be impossible now to estimate the loss.  Manuscripts of ancient and classic date would in their hands receive no  more respect than some dry husky folio on ecclesiastical policy; indeed,  they often destroyed the works of their own party through sheer  ignorance. In a letter sent by Dr. Cox to William "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21632"],[0,"Fame and Fortune; or, The Progress of Richard Hunter (#3)"],[1,"the valuable  relics,\" suggested Frank.    \"By gracious!\" said Dick, suddenly, \"there they are now. It's the first  time I've seen 'em since they was stolen.\"    He pointed to a boy, of about his own size, who was coming up Broadway.  He was attired in the well-remembered coat and pants; but, alas! time  had not spared them. The solitary remaining coat-tail was torn in many  places; of one sleeve but a fragment remained; grease and dirt nearly  obliterated the original color; and it was a melancholy vestige of what  it had been once. As for the pantaloons, they were a complete wreck.  When Dick had possessed them they were well ventilated; but they were  now ventilated so much more thoroughly that, as Dick said afterwards, \"a  feller would be warmer without any.\"    \"That's Micky Maguire,\" said Dick; \"a partic'lar friend of mine, that  had such a great 'fection for me that he stole my clothes to remember me  by.\"    \"Perhaps,\" said Fosdick, \"it was on account of his great respect for  General Washington and the Emperor Napoleon.\"    \"What would the great Washington say if he could see his coat now?\" said  Frank.    \"When I wore it,\" said Dick, \"I was sorry he was so great, 'cause it  prevented his clothes fitting me.\"    It may be necessary to explain to those who are unacquainted with Dick's  earlier adventures, that the clothes in which he was originally  introduced were jocosely referred to by him as gifts from the  illustrious personages whose names have been mentioned.    Micky Maguire did not at first recognize Dick. When he did so, he  suddenly shambled down Prince Street, fearful, perhaps, that the stolen  clothes would be reclaimed.    They had now reached the St. Nicholas, and entered. Mr. Whitney led the  way up to his apartment, and then, having a business engagement with a  gentleman below, he descended to the reading-room, leaving the boys  alone. Left to themselves, they talked freely. Dick related fully the  different steps in his education, with which some of our readers are  already familiar, and received hearty congratulations from Frank, and  earnest encouragement to persevere.    \"I wish you were going to be in the city, Frank,\" said Dick.    \"So I shall be soon,\" said Frank.    Dick's face lighted up with pleasure.    \"That's bully,\" said he, enthusiastically. \"How soon are you comin'?\"    \"I am hoping to enter Columbia College next commencement. I suppose my  time will be a good deal taken up with study, but I shall always find  time for you and Fosdick. I hope you both will call upon me.\"    Both boys readily accepted the invitation in advance, and Dick promised  to write to Frank at his boarding-school in Connecticut. At about half  past ten, the two boys left the St. Nicholas, and went back to their  boarding-house.    After a comfortable night's sleep, they got up punctually to the seven  o'clock breakfast. It consisted of beefsteak, hot biscuit, potatoes, and  very good coffee. Dick and Fosdick did justice to the separate viands,  and congratulated themselves upon the superiority of their present fare  to that which they had been accustomed to obtain at the restaurants.    Breakfast over, Fosdick set out for the hat and cap store in which he  was employed, and Dick for Rockwell & Cooper's on Pearl Street. It must  be confessed that he felt a little bashful as he stood in front of the  large warehouse, and surveyed the sign. He began to feel some  apprehensions that he would not be found competent for his post. It  seemed such a rise from the streets to be employed in such an imposing  building. But Dick did not long permit timidity to stand in his way. He  entered the large apartment on the first floor, which he found chiefly  used for storing large boxes and cases of goods. There was a  counting-room and office, occupying one corner, partitioned off from the  rest of the department. Dick could see a young man through the glass  partition sitting at a desk; and, opening the door, he entered. He  wished it had been Mr. Rockwell, for it would have saved him from  introducing himself; but of course it was too early for that gentleman  to appear.    \"What is your business?\" inquired the book-keeper, for it was he.    \"I've come to work,\" said Dick, shortly, for somehow he did not take  much of a fancy to the book-keeper, whose tone was rather supercilious.    \"Oh, you've come to work, have you?\"    \"Yes, I have,\" said Dick, independently.    \"I don't think we shall need your valuable services,\" said the  book-keeper, with something of a sneer. The truth was, that Mr. Rockwell  had neglected to mention that he had engaged Dick.    Dick, though a little inclined to be bashful when he entered, had quite  got over that feeling now. He didn't intend to be intimidated or driven  away by the man before him. There was only one doubt in his mind. This  might be Mr. Cooper, the second member of the firm, although he did not  think it at all probable. So he ventured this question, \"Is Mr. Rockwell  or Mr. Cooper in?\"    \"They're never here at this hour.\"    \"So I supposed,\" said Dick, coolly.    He sat down in an arm-chair, and took up the morning paper.    The book-keeper was decidedly provoked by his coolness. He felt that he  had not impressed Dick with his dignity or authority, and this made him  angry.    \"Bring that paper to me, young man,\" he said; \"I want to consult it.\"    \"Very good,\" said Dick; \"you can come and get it.\"    \"I can't compliment you on your good manners,\" said the other.    \"Good manners don't seem to be fashionable here,\" said Dick, composedly.    Apparently the book-keeper did not want the paper very particularly, as  he did not take the trouble to get up for it. Dick therefore resumed his  reading, and the other dug his pen spitefully into the paper, wishing,  but not quite daring, to order Dick out of the counting-room, as it  might be possible that he had come by appointment.    \"Did you come to see Mr. Rockwell?\" he asked, at length, looking up from  his writing.    \"Yes,\" said Dick.    \"Did he tell you to come?\"    \"Yes.\"    \"What was that you said about coming to work?\"    \"I said I had come here to work.\"    \"Who engaged you?\"    \"Mr. Rockwell.\"    \"Oh, indeed! And how much are you to receive for your valuable  services?\"    \"You are very polite to call my services valuable,\" said Dick. \"I hope  they will be.\"    \"You haven't answered my question.\"    \"I have no objection, I'm sure. I'm to get ten dollars a week.\"    \"Ten dollars a week!\" echoed the book-keeper, with a scornful laugh. \"Do  you expect you will earn that?\"    \"No, I don't,\" said Dick, frankly.    \"You don't!\" returned the other, doubtfully. \"Well, you're more modest  than I thought for. Then why are you to get so much?\"    \"Perhaps Mr. Rockwell will tell you,\" said Dick, \"if you tell him you're  very particular to know, and will lose a night's rest if you don't find  out.\"    \"I wouldn't give you a dollar a week.\"    \"Then I'm glad I aint goin' to work for you.\"    \"I don't believe your story at all. I don't think Mr. Rockwell would be  such a fool as to overpay you so much.\"    \"P'r'aps I shouldn't be the only one in the establishment that is  overpaid,\" observed Dick.    \"Do you mean me, you young rascal?\" demanded the book-keeper, now very  angry.    \"Don't call names. It isn't polite.\"    \"I demand an answer. Do you mean to say that I am overpaid?\"    \"Well,\" said Dick, deliberately, \"if you're paid anything for bein'  polite, I should think you was overpaid considerable.\"    There is no knowing how long this skirmishing would have continued, if  Mr. Rockwell himself had not just then entered the counting-room. Dick  rose respectfully at his entrance, and the merchant, recognizing him at  once, advanced smiling and gave him a cordial welcome.    \"I am glad to see you, my boy,\" he said. \"So you didn't forget the  appointment. How long have you been here?\"    \"Half an hour, sir.\"    \"I am here unusually early this morning. I came purposely to see you,  and introduce you to those with whom you will labor. Mr. Gilbert, this  is a young man who is going to enter our establishment. His name is  Richard Hunter. Mr. Gilbert, Richard, is our book-keeper.\"    Mr. Gilbert nodded slightly, not a little surprised at his employer's  cordiality to the new boy.    \"So the fellow was right, after all,\" he thought. \"But it can't be  possible he is to receive ten dollars a week.\"    \"Come out into the ware-room, and I will show you about,\" continued Mr.  Rockwell. \"How do you think you shall like business, Richard?\"    Dick was on the point of saying \"Bully,\" but checked himself just in  time, and said instead, \"Very much indeed, sir.\"    \"I hope you will. If you do well you may depend upon promotion. I shall  not forget under what a heavy obligation I am to you, my brave boy.\"    What would the book-keeper have said, if he had heard this?    \"How is the little boy, sir?\" asked Dick.    \"Very well, indeed. He does not appear even to have taken cold, as might  have been expected from his exposure, and remaining in wet clothes for  some time.\"    \"I am glad to hear that he is well, sir.\"    \"You must come up and see him for yourself, Richard,\" said Mr. Rockwell,  in a friendly manner. \"I have no doubt you will become good friends very  soon. Besides, my wife is anxious to see and thank the preserver of her  boy.\"    \"I shall be very glad indeed to come, sir.\"    \"I live at No. ---- Madison Avenue. Come to-morrow evening, if you have  no engagement.\"    \"Thank you, sir.\"    Mr. Rockwell now introduced Dick to his head clerk with a few words,  stating that he was a lad in whose welfare he took a deep interest, and  he would be glad to have him induct him into his duties, and regard with  indulgence any mistakes which he might at first make through ignorance.    The head clerk was a pleasant-looking man, of middle age, named Murdock;  very different in his manners and bearing from Mr. Gilbert, the  book-keeper.    "]]]
