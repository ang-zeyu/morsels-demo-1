Four windows give us an  extended view of our Dame Chatelaine's sloping meadows and wooded  hills, and the carriage road winding off towards the pine grove and the  house in the woods.  We have several pictures on the walls--first a  portrait of my dear uncle; a boyish face with fair hair, deep blue  eyes, and an expression angelic in sweetness.  No one would imagine it  to be the face of a married man, but it was painted, mamma says, when  he was thirty years old.  Two large and admirable photographs, taken  early last summer, hang opposite it.  A striking contrast they are to  the pensive, fragile, blonde boy; these are impressed with the vigor  and mental and physical activity of his busy life, but the broad  intellectual brow, and the almost divine expression that plays about  the mouth, are the same in each.    An engraving from a picture by Paul Delaroche, the Archangel  Gabriel--the \"patron,\" in Catholic parlance, of our little  Gabrielle--hangs between the windows, and over the comfortable sofa is  a copy of Liotard's celebrated pastel \"la belle Chocolatiere\" in the  Dresden Gallery.  This copy Aunt Mary bought in that city when there  some years ago, and it is considered wonderfully fine.  Very pretty and  coquettish she looks in her picturesque Vienna dress, with the small,  neatly-fitting cap, ample apron, and tiny Louis Quinze shoes.  In her  case      \"My face is my fortune,\"    was exemplified, and so pretty and modest is her demeanor that it is no  wonder that Count Dietrichstein, haughty nobleman though he was,  married her.  She is very different, however, from the chocolate  vendors whom I have seen in the streets of Paris.  I don't think a  nobleman would ever raise one of them from their original station, for  they are as a rule past fifty, and ugly and withered as only a  Frenchwoman of that age can be.    Breakfast is followed by a turn upon the piazza, a little stroll to the  spring, near which delicious wild strawberries nestle in a background  of sweet clover, bright buttercups, and field daisies, or a game of  croquet under the grand old oak-trees      \"After the sun has dried the dew.\"    Then we separate, each to our own room, and our different occupations.    [Illustration: The Spring.]    Ida is very busy now, for she is preparing a volume for publication in  the fall--her dear father's manuscript lectures and letters.    Gabrielle throws herself upon a sofa, and lies there motionless,  absorbed in the fascinating pages of some favorite book; indeed, she is  so quiet that in my periodical fits of tidiness I often seize a print  or bombazine frock, thrown, as I suppose, carelessly upon the bed or  sofa, and only by its weight do I discover that it is animated.  Last  year, Gabrielle's favorite site for reading was in the dear old  apple-tree close beside the house; but since she has attained the  dignity of sixteen and train dresses, she has abjured the apple-tree.    Marguerite is translating a volume from the German, _Musikalische  Maerchen_, and I divide my time between the piano and occasional  newspaper articles.    But it is already one o'clock and dinner hour.  The afternoon passes  much like the morning.  We have letters to write, and much reading  aloud.  I have two books in progress--Plato's \"Dialogues,\" and Madame  de Staeel's incomparable \"Germany:\" the latter I read aloud while in  Munich, but it is a work that cannot be too often studied.    At half-past six we dress and go down to the postoffice (about a  hundred yards distant) for the evening mail.  Half an hour later we  sup, and then follows, as L. E. L. would say, \"a struggle and a  sacrifice.\"  What could be more delicious than a game of croquet, or a  drive in the cool twilight?  But Chappaqua, lovely though it is,  possesses a malaria that is dangerous after sunset, they say, and much  as I love to drive when Nature is bathed in the last ruddy flush of  day, and during the soft gray hour that succeeds it, I must heed the  prediction of _chills_ to all who indulge.    The evening is always devoted to music.  Both Ida and Gabrielle are  very fond of the piano, and Ida is rapidly becoming quite proficient in  the divine art.  She commenced the study of music when a little child,  under an excellent teacher, and also took lessons while in  boarding-school; but one studies the piano under difficulties while in  the routine of a _pensionnat_, for the hour devoted to it must be taken  from one's recreation time, or from some other lessons.  Our friends  will remember, too, that dear Ida was taken out of school while yet  very young, to become the devoted nurse that she has since shown  herself to her mother, and from the time she left the _Sacre Coeur_  until this spring she has never opened the piano.  Now, however, she  practises regularly and conscientiously, and brings to her music all  the enthusiasm of her loving nature, and the intelligence of her  superior mind; consequently, when her fingers are well trained, I shall  expect to see her a thoughtful and brilliant pianist.    Gabrielle is still in the tedious preliminary steps, for Geometry and  Latin, rather than the _Rhythme des Doigts_ and the _Ecole de la  Velocite_, have hitherto engaged her attention; but time will show.

As unexpected visit yesterday from Mr. O'Dwyer, a member of _The  Tribune_ staff, and for several years dear uncle's private secretary.    Mamma had invited Mr. O'Dwyer to come out and pass a quiet day with us,  and had appointed Wednesday for the visit.  Desirous of a little  excitement, and already somewhat weary of our nun-like simplicity of  toilette, we decided to do honor to our guest by dressing our hair  quite elaborately, and attiring ourselves, despite the heat, in our  best bombazines with their weight of crape.  We were assembled in the  dining-room after our early dinner, discussing, in our plain print  wrappers and Marguerite braids, our plans for the morrow, when Minna  announced:    \"A visit, Madame; a gentleman.\"    \"Probably a neighbor upon business,\" said mamma to us; \"show him in  here, Minna.\"    The door opened, and enter the guest for whom, in imagination, we were  making such extensive preparations.    A very expressive glance was telegraphed around our circle.  I was  engaged in the domestic occupation of hemming one of papa's  handkerchiefs, and although Hawthorne draws so pretty a picture of the  beautiful Miriam while engaged in \"the feminine task of mending a pair  of gloves,\" with all deference to the poet's taste, I consider the  beguiling little scraps of canvas or kid which I produce when company  is present, much more attractive than plain sewing.    In a moment the surprise was explained.  Mr. O'Dwyer had received  orders to represent _The Tribune_ somewhere, the following day, just in  time to catch the Pleasantville express, and run out to tell us that he  could not come at the time appointed.    \"The circumstances were trying,\" we said to each other, after his  departure; but imagine, girls, how much worse they would have been, had  the visitor been a lady!  As long as a wrapper is black, I very much  doubt if a gentleman would know it from an afternoon dress.      _June 8_.    The usual routine of our morning occupations has been somewhat broken  of late, for these June days are too perfect to be spent within doors,  even with such grand companions as Plato or Beethoven.  We plan  charming hours to be spent in the pine grove, where Marguerite will  read to us a chapter or two of Kohlrausch's \"Germany,\" and Ida will  give us a few pages of Taine's brilliant \"Angleterre;\" but as we are  starting with camp chairs, books, and work, Bernard approaches:    \"Any orders, Miss?\"    Frail mortals are too weak to resist, and in a few moments we are  seated in Ida's stylish new phaeton; and Gabrielle's irrepressible  ponies, under the guidance of Tourbillon herself, are dashing away at a  pace that terrifies our sober Quaker neighbors beyond expression.  Mamma has been solemnly warned against allowing Gabrielle to drive  \"those fearful horses;\" but we all share our pretty Tourbillon's  fondness for a _tourbillon_ pace, and know well the strength she  possesses in her little wrists, and the coolness she could exercise  were there any danger.    While returning from a charming drive upon the Sing Sing road, a day or  two since, the horses, whose spirits were unusually high, shied  suddenly at something dark by the roadside.  By a dexterous management  of the reins, Gabrielle quickly subdued them, and we all looked to see  what had startled them.  An object was crouching in the grass,  evidently human, but of what sex or nationality it was impossible in  one swift glance to determine; and it was quite amusing to hear our  different opinions as we drove on.    \"I think,\" said mamma, \"that it was an enormous woman, with a baby in  her arms, but I really cannot be sure, for I only looked at the  face--such a hideous, repulsive face.  I shall dream of it to-night, I  am convinced.\"    \"A woman!\" said Marguerite.  \"My impression was of a very  murderous-looking man--an Indian, I thought, he was so very dark.\"    Gabrielle's view of the case differed from the others.  The creature  had, she said, a heavy black beard, which, was un-Indian-like, and was  garbed in a dark calico gown with open sleeves, through which she  plainly perceived a pair of unmistakably muscular, masculine arms.  In  the words of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18298"],[0,"Essays in Natural History and Agriculture (#3)"],[1," to come alone her eggs would be impregnated by the  Par. It is an excellent maxim, that Nature makes no useless  provisions; yet, if we admit that Par are young Salmon, for what  purpose is the milt if not to impregnate Salmon roe? and if we  deny this to be the fact, we must endeavour to show that there are  female Par, but in all my examinations, I have never been able to  meet with one that contained roe. That the Grilse are Salmon is  proved I think sufficiently by the evidence given before the House  of Commons. Mr. Wm. Stephens states (see Rep., p. 52) that he has  known Grilse kept in a salt-water pond until they became Salmon,  and that fry that had been marked came back that year as Grilse,  and the year after as Salmon; and Mr. George Hogarth states that  he has often seen a Salmon and a Grilse working together on the  spawning beds, as two Salmon, or two Grilse; and Mr. Mackenzie  states (page 21) that he, in March, 1823, marked a Grilse Kelt  with brass wire, and caught it again in March, 1824, a Salmon of  seven pounds weight. The testimony of the witnesses from the Ness,  the Severn, the Lee, and some other rivers, is too positive and  too well supported to admit of any doubt as to the excellent  condition of many of the fish ascending those rivers in November,  December, and January--a period when they are out of season, and  full of spawn generally, and even when many fish are caught in  those rivers in the same unseasonable condition. The fact that  there are many fish in fine season in those months may be, I  think, accounted for, if we admit that Salmon spawn every other  year, which I have I think shown to be very probable; but what it  is that induces those fish to ascend rivers so many months before  the spawning season, I cannot explain. Probably there may be some  quality in the waters of these rivers, all the year, which is  congenial to the habits of the fish, while the same quality may  only be found during part of the year in others; it is certain  that the quality of the waters in rivers generally varies very  much with the season: thus the water of the Ribble, after a flood  in summer, is always of a dark brown colour, being so coloured by  the peat moss over which it passes, while in winter no such tinge  can be observed; and there may be other differences with which we  are unacquainted; however, whether this is the true reason or not,  it certainly cannot be that the fish which spawn in October are  impelled by their desire to propagate their species to ascend the  river the January before; and if this long residence in fresh  water were necessary for the proper development of the ova in one  river, we might suppose it would be necessary in all; yet this is  not the case, as the red fish which ascend the river in November  and December have at that time the spawn in them nearly ready for  exclusion.    On one point, about which there is great difference of opinion,  viz. whether the fish which are bred in the river generally resort  to it again, and whether each river has its own variety of fish, I  am not a competent judge, as I am acquainted with too few rivers  to pretend to decide. I may, however, just remark that the Hodder,  though it is a much smaller river than the Ribble, is always much  better stocked with Salmon, Morts, Sprods, Smolts, and Par than is  the latter river, which I attribute to the fact that more fish  spawn in the river Hodder, which runs for many miles through the  Forest of Bowland (the property of the Duke of Buccleuch) and  other large estates, and the fish are much better protected there  than in the Ribble, where, with one or two exceptions, the  properties are very much divided, and few people think it worth  their while to trouble themselves on the subject. Dr. Fleming, in  his letter to Mr. Kennedy (Appendix to the first Rep., 1825),  seems to doubt that Salmon enter rivers for any other purpose than  of propagation, but lest I should misrepresent his opinions, I  will quote what he has said on the subject:--\"In the evidence  taken before the Select Committee during the last season of  Parliament, and appearing in the report, there are several  statements of a somewhat imposing kind, which, as they appear to  me to be erroneous and apt to mislead, I shall here take the  liberty of opposing.\" He then enumerates several opinions  expressed before the Select Committee, one of which is, that  Salmon enter and leave rivers for other purposes than those  connected with spawning (see the evidence of Messrs. Little,  Halliday, and Johnstone).    First, \"That they enter rivers to rid themselves of sea lice  (_Monoculus piscinus_);\" secondly, \"That they forsake rivers to  save themselves from being exhausted by residence in fresh water,  and from having their gills devoured by a maggot (_Lernaea  salmonea_).\" The whole history of the Salmon contradicts this  hypothesis. Another of these errors is, that it is asserted (Rep.,  1824, p. 145), \"That Salmon always return to the same river;\" this  is not probable, when we consider the circumstances in which they  are placed during their residence in the sea. On the first of  these opinions, I am not a competent judge; but I think that the  fact that Salmon enter rivers nine or ten months before they are  ready to spawn, is of itself sufficient to show that there are  other reasons for their entering rivers than those connected with  propagation. With respect to the second, I believe that after  Salmon have once entered rivers, at least when they have ascended  into the upper parts of them, they never offer to descend again  until they have spawned. On the third opinion I would remark, that  although I do not think that Salmon always come to the same river  in which they were bred, yet I think they will do so if they can;  and I think that the fact which I have mentioned of the Hodder, a  smaller and a tributary stream to the Ribble, containing many more  Salmon, as well as more Morts and Sprods, countenances this  supposition, for why should the larger number of fish ascend the  smaller river except for such a reason?    I am of opinion that Salmon do not grow so fast in the sea as is  generally supposed. It is here generally believed that the Smolts,  which go down in the spring, come up again in the August or  September following, five or six pounds in weight; and George  Little, Esq., in his evidence states that as his opinion, but he  does not give any other reason for it than this: \"That the Grilse  that ascend the river in June weigh one and a half or two pounds,  and that those which come in September weigh five or six pounds,\"  --but opposed to this supposition is the evidence of Mr. Mackenzie,  before referred to (second Parl. Report, p. 21), who states that  he caught in March a Grilse Kelt which weighed three and a half  pounds, that he marked it with a brass wire, and let it go, and  that in the March following he caught it again a Salmon of seven  pounds weight. Now a fish which weighed three and a half pounds as  a Kelt, would weigh five pounds or six pounds when in high  condition the summer before, and if this were so, which I believe  all persons who are acquainted with Salmon will admit, the fish  would have gained only one pound or two pounds in fifteen or  eighteen months. Besides, if Salmon grew as fast as is stated and  believed by many persons, the breeds of different years would vary  very much in weight, whereas it is known to everybody that we have  them of all sizes, from five pounds to forty pounds; and it is  contrary to analogy to suppose that a fish which is two or three  years in arriving at the weight of as many ounces, should in two  or three months acquire as many pounds. There are, however, two or  three things about which all persons agree in opinion--one of  these is: that the breed of Salmon is decreasing every year, and  that the great cause of this decrease is the want of protection,  and a consequent destruction in the spawning season. The complaint  on this head is universal from north to south; from the Shannon to  the Tweed, the cry is--\"Protect the breeding fish, or we shall  very soon have none to protect.\" And yet, although the destruction  of the spawning fish, and the destruction of the fry in the  Spring, are the chief reasons for this alarming falling off, no  one seems able to devise a remedy; no one seems inclined to make  the necessary sacrifices for so desirable an object, and without  these sacrifices it would be absurd to expect the fish to become  plentiful; and instead of furnishing an abundant supply of cheap  and wholesome food to all classes, which they certainly would do  if the fisheries were properly regulated, they will either become  wholly extinct, or so rare as to be found only at the tables of  the wealthy. James Gillies, in his evidence, states that his  brother had in one night killed in the Tweed four hundred Salmon  at one landing-place in close time; and all the reports are full  of statements showing how unceasing and universal is the  persecution the Salmon undergo, not only when in season, but at  all times, and most of all when every one should do his utmost to  preserve them--I mean when they are spawning. In this neighbourhood  the properties generally are so much divided, and so few good fish  are allowed to ascend the river, that no one has any interest in  protecting them in close time, and the consequence is, as might be  expected, that all sorts of contrivances for taking them are  resorted to: they are speared and netted in the streams by day and  night; they are caught with the fly, they are taken with switch  hooks (large hooks fixed to the ends of staves), or with a triple  hook fixed to the end of a running line and a salmon rod; if the  river becomes low, parties of idle fellows go up each side of it  in search of them, and by stoning the deeps, or dragging a horse's  skull, or large bone of any kind through them,"]]]
