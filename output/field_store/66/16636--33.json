THE CLAIMS AND IMPORTANCE OF VOCAL PHYSIOLOGY.      To know consciously and to do with special reference to guiding  principles are to be distinguished from carrying out some process  without bearing in mind the why or wherefore. Science is exact and  related knowledge, facts bound together by principles. Art is  execution, doing, and has not necessarily any conscious reference to  principles.    While every art has its corresponding science, their relation is in  some cases of much greater practical importance than in others. While  a painter may be the better for knowing the laws of light, there can  be no question that he may do very good work without any knowledge  whatever of the science of optics. He is at least in no danger of  injuring any part of his person.    Entirely otherwise is it with the voice-user. He employs a delicate  and easily injured vital apparatus. His results depend on the most  accurate adjustment of certain neuro-muscular mechanisms, and one  might suppose that it would be obvious to all who are concerned with  this art that a knowledge of the structure and functions of these  delicate arrangements of Nature would be at least of great if not of  essential importance. The engineer knows the structure and uses of  each part of his engine, and does not trust to unintelligent  observation of the mere working of mechanisms which others have  constructed. The architect studies not only the principles of design,  etc., but also the nature and relative value of materials. In his own  way he is a kind of anatomist and physiologist.    We do not trust the care of our bodies to those who have picked up a  few methods of treatment by experience or the imitation of others. The  doctor must have, we all believe, a knowledge of the structure and  working of the animal body; he must understand the action of drugs and  other healing agents. We expect him not only to diagnose the  disease--to tell us exactly what is the matter--but also to be able to  predict with, some degree of certainty the course of the malady. Even  the nurse of the day must show some grasp of the principles underlying  her art.    In connection with all the largest and best equipped universities in  America there are officials to plan and direct the courses in physical  culture. This matter is no longer entrusted to a \"trainer,\" who has  only his experience and observation to rely upon. It is realized that  the building up of the mechanism which they are supposed to train in  an intelligent manner rests upon well-established principles.    It would be just as reasonable for an engineer to point to the fact  that his engine works well, as evidence of his ability, as for the  teacher of voice-production to make the same claim in regard to the  vocal mechanism. In each case there is a certain amount of  justification for the claim, but such teaching cannot be called  scientific. Is it even enlightened? It is just as rational to follow  in medicine methods that seem to lead to good results, without any  reference to the reason why, as to train for results in speaking and  singing by methods which have for the student and teacher no conscious  basis in scientific knowledge. The physician to-day who treats disease  without reference to anatomy and physiology is, at best, but a sort of  respectable charlatan. Why should students and teachers of  voice-production be content to remain, in the advanced present, where  they were hundreds of years ago?    Indeed, there is much more reason now than formerly why the vocalist,  speaker, and teacher should have a theoretical and practical  knowledge of the structure and workings of the mechanism employed.  Many tendencies of the present day work against successful  voice-training--worst of all, perhaps, the spirit of haste, the desire  to reach ends by short cuts, the aim to substitute tricky for  straightforward vocalization, and much more which I shall refer to  again and again. They hurt this cause; and I am deeply impressed with  the conviction that, if we are to attain the best results in singing  and speaking, we must betake ourselves in practice to the methods in  vogue at a time which may be justly characterized as the golden age of  voice-production.    We have advanced, musically, in many respects since the days of the  old Italian masters, but just as we must turn to the Greeks to learn  what constitutes the highest and best in sculpture, so must we sit at  the feet of these old masters. Consciously or unconsciously they  taught on sound physiological principles, and they insisted on the  voice-training absolutely necessary to the attainment of the best art.    However talented any individual may be, he can only produce the best  results as a singer, actor, or speaker, when the mechanisms by which  he hopes to influence his listeners are adequately trained. Why do we  look in vain to-day for elocutionists such as Vandenhoff, Bell, and  others? Why are there not actors with the voices of Garrick, Kean,  Kemble, or Mrs. Siddons, or singers with the vocal powers of a score  of celebrities of a former time? It is not that voices are rarer, or  talent less widely bestowed by nature. It is because _we do not to-day  pursue right methods for a sufficient length of time_; because our  methods rest frequently on a foundation less physiological, and  therefore less sound. Take a single instance, breath-control. In this  alone singers to-day are far behind those of the old Italian period,  not always because they do not know how to breathe, but because often  they are unwilling to give the time necessary for the full development  of adequate breathing power and control.    There was probably never a time when so much attention was paid to the  interpretation of music, yet the results are often unsatisfactory  because of inadequate technique. People seem to hope to impress us, on  the stage, with voices that from a technical point of view are crude  and undeveloped, and accordingly lack beauty and expressiveness.  Speakers to-day have often every qualification except voice--a voice  that can arrest attention, charm with its music, or carry conviction  by the adequate expression of the idea or emotion intended.    Is it not strange that a student of the piano or violin is willing to  devote perhaps ten years to the study of the technique of his  instrument, while the voice-user expects to succeed with a period of  vocal practice extending over a year or two, possibly even only a few  months?    When the anatomy and physiology of the larynx are considered, it will  be seen that the muscular mechanisms concerned in voice-production are  of a delicacy unequalled anywhere in the body except possibly in the  eye and the ear. And when it is further considered that these  elaborate and sensitive mechanisms of the larynx are of little use  except when adequately put into action by the breath-stream, which  again involves hosts of other muscular movements, and the whole in  relation to the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19881"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Carlisle (#3)"],[1,"Crown in January 1540, and the last  prior--Salkeld--was made dean of the chapter founded by Henry VIII. The  revenue was at that time estimated at L 481 per annum. Five years later,  June 1545, the present foundation was settled, and the dedication  changed to that of the Holy and Undivided Trinity.    We get a glimpse of the cathedral in the first half of the seventeenth  century, in the record left by some officers who visited the English  cathedrals in 1634. Carlisle they curtly speak of as \"more like a great  wilde country church\" than a fair and stately cathedral.    After the capture of the city in 1645 the parliamentary troops pulled  down part of the nave in order to repair the fortifications. It is very  probable that the Norman church was partly built of stones taken from  the Roman wall; and it is strange to find the western part of the same  church being destroyed nearly six hundred years after in order to repair  the city walls.    George Fox, the intrepid founder of the Society of Friends, came to  Carlisle in 1653 and preached in the cathedral. Some of the congregation  being opposed to him, he was guarded while preaching, by certain  soldiers and friends who had \"heard him gladly.\" At length the \"rude  people of the city\" rushed into the building, and made a tumult, so that  the governor was forced to send musketeers to quell it.    Fox thus describes the scene, in his \"Journal\":    \"From thence we came to Carlisle.    \"On the First-day following I went into the steeple-house: and after the  priest had done, I preached the truth to the people, and declared the  word of life amongst them. The priest got away, and the magistrates  desired me to go out of the steeple-house. But I still declared the way  of the Lord unto them, and told them, 'I came to speak the word of life  and salvation from the Lord amongst them.' The power of the Lord was  dreadful amongst them in the steeple-house, so that the people trembled  and shook, and they thought the steeple-house shook: and some of them  feared it would fall down on their heads. The magistrates' wives were in  a rage and strove mightily to be at me: but the soldiers and friendly  people stood thick about me. At length the rude people of the city  rose, and came with staves and stones into the steeple-house crying,  'Down with these round-headed rogues'; and they threw stones. Whereupon  the governor sent a file or two of musketeers into the steeple-house, to  appease the tumult, and commanded all the other soldiers out. So those  soldiers took me by the hand in a friendly manner, and said they would  have me along with them. When we came forth into the street, the city  was in an uproar, and the governor came down; and some of those soldiers  were put in prison for standing by me, and for me, against the  town's-people.    \"The next day the justices and magistrates of the town granted a warrant  against me and sent for me to come before them. After a large  examination they committed me to prison as a blasphemer, a heretic, and  a seducer: though they could not justly charge any such thing against  me.\"    Fuller, about 1660, describes the building as \"black but comely, still  bearing the remaining signes of its former burning.\"    Further mischief was also done to the building by the Jacobite prisoners  who were lodged in it after the defeat of the Young Pretender.    In the latter half of the eighteenth century some attempts were made at  restoring the cathedral, but they for the most part consisted of hiding  the beautiful choir roof with a stucco groined ceiling, and plentifully  whitewashing the building.    \"The roof was 'elegantly' vaulted with wood. But this failing by length  of time, together with the lead roof, the dean and chapter some few  years ago new laid the roof, and the ceiling being totally ruined and  destroyed they in the year 1764 contracted for a stucco groined ceiling,  and for cleaning and whitening the whole church. And finding the new  lead much torn and broken by wind for want of a ceiling underneath, the  upper tire of that was done again, and a coping added to the rigging.  And thus proceeding from one repair to another the whole expence hath  amounted to upwards of L 1300.\"[1]      [1] Nicholson and Burn, page 249.    Eastward of the stalls the choir was formerly separated from the aisles  by screens of elaborate tracery work. When the cathedral was \"repaired  and beautified\" as just described, they were removed to outbuildings,  and by far the greater part lost or destroyed.    The cathedral was restored 1853-7, in good taste, at a cost of about  L 15,000. Mr. Ewan Christian, the architect of the Ecclesiastical  Commissioners, undertook the work, and happily succeeded in  counteracting the \"repairing and beautifying\" of 1764.    Carlisle is not a large or notable cathedral, but its delightful Early  English choir with its magnificent east window will ever redeem it from  being insignificant or uninteresting.          CHAPTER II    THE EXTERIOR      On examining the north side of the cathedral, it is apparent that more  than one plan has been followed in the construction of the building as  it stands.    There are the remains of a Norman nave whose roof is lower than the  choir roof. The choir is Early English with clerestory windows, and the  easternmost bay (the retro-choir) Late Decorated; while the tower is  Perpendicular. In the north window of the north transept we have a  specimen of work of the nineteenth century. Thus the cathedral supplies  examples of architecture from the Norman period down to the present  time.    The moderate height of the #Nave# (65 ft.), and the treatment of its  details, are quite characteristic of the best work of the period when it  was erected.    The bays of the aisle are separated by flat buttresses about five and a  half feet wide projecting nearly one foot beyond the wall, and the  parapet wall in which they terminate is supported above the windows by a  corbel table of shields and trefoil heads.[2]      [2] These date from about 1400.    Upon the string-course which runs along the wall unbroken by the  buttresses there is in each bay a window with a circular head, flanked  by single columns. A ring-like ornament is used as a decoration for one  of the mouldings of the arch.    These windows, except the one above the doorway, are restorations. The  doorway itself, which leads into the nave, is modern, imitated from the  Norman window.    The Clerestory in each compartment has a window which differs from the  aisle windows in having the billet as decoration of its outer moulding.  The string-course at the spring of the round head runs without a break  from one to the other.    There is also an unbroken corbel table above the windows, of very  expressive, life-like heads, no two of which are alike.    [Illustration: THE CATHEDRAL FROM THE NORTH. _A. Pumphrey, Photo._]    #North Transept.#--The north window is Debased Gothic, the tracery of  the previous window having been similar to that of the great east  window, while the west window is early English.    [Illustration: NORTH DOOR OF NAVE. _A. Pumphrey, Photo._]    The #Tower#, the latest part of the cathedral, was the work of Bishop  Strickland early in the fifteenth century. He erected it upon the piers  of the ancient Norman tower. Its height is not much over 100 feet, and  is very disappointing, because in England \"cathedral towers are apt to  be good, and really make their mark\" (Pater). In fact, it does not at  all give the impression of being part of such an important building as a  cathedral. This is caused by its having been rebuilt on the scale of the  Norman nave, and not on that of the enlarged choir. It takes up only  about two-thirds of the width of the choir, and to mask this defect a  turret rising to the top of the third stage of the tower is introduced  on the north side, and another turret is added at the north-east angle.    The tower rises in four stages above the transepts. The second storey is  pierced with loopholes. The third has two pointed windows lighting a  room immediately below the belfry. Between these, in a niche with a  canopy, is the figure of an angel holding a drawn sword. On his head is  fixed a tablet to support another figure. There is only one window in  the fourth storey, which gives light to the belfry, and is very large.  Its labels are ornamented with very vigorously carved heads, and the  cornice above is decorated very much like that of the clerestory. The  tower terminates in an embattled parapet.    All the windows have been thrown out of centre by the addition of the  lower turret.    Originally the tower was crowned by a leaden spire about fifteen feet in  height, but this was removed at the end of the seventeenth century on  account of its decayed condition.    On the east side of the tower there is a single window in the third  storey. In place of a second window there is an opening into the roof of  the choir. This leads into a passage running from the tower to the east  end.    The bold attempts to veil the inadequate size of the tower by the  addition of two turrets can be best studied from this side.    The North Aisle of the #Choir# consists of eight bays, all Early  English, except the easternmost one (the retro-choir), which is Late  Decorated; while the western bay has a Perpendicular window.    Sometime in the fifteenth century the third bay from the east, in each  aisle, was altered and a large Perpendicular window inserted in order to  admit more light to the sanctuary. During the restoration of the  cathedral these later windows were removed, and replaced by careful  copies of the other Early English windows.    The basement is composed of bold mouldings with a plain wall equivalent  in height to the internal wall arcade. Over this, a string-course runs  uninterruptedly round the choir just below the windows.    [Illustration: THE SOUTH DOOR. (See p. 21.) _A."]]]
