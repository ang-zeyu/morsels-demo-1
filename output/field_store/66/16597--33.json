And 'Ali _Kh_an of Maku, because of his excessive love for  the family of the Prophet, paid Him such attention as was possible, and  gave permission [to some persons] to converse with Him.    Now when the accomplished divines of A_dh_irbayjan perceived that in all  the parts round about Tabriz it was as though the last day had come by  reason of the excessive clamor, they requested the government to punish  the [Bab's] followers, and to remove the Bab to the Castle of _Ch_ihriq.  So they sent Him to that castle and consigned Him to the keeping of Yahya  _Kh_an the Kurd.    Glory be to God! Notwithstanding these decisions of great doctors and  reverend lawyers, and severe punishments and reprimands--beatings,  banishments, and imprisonments--on the part of governors, this sect was  daily on the increase, and the discussion and disputation was such that in  meetings and assemblies in all parts of Persia there was no conversation  but on this topic. Great was the commotion which arose: the doctors of the  Perspicuous Religion were lamenting, the common folk clamorous and  agitated, and the Friends rejoicing and applauding.    But the Bab Himself attached no importance to this uproar and tumult, and,  alike on the road and in the castles of Maku and _Ch_ihriq, evening and  morning, nay, day and night, in extremest rapture and amazement, He would  restrict Himself to repeating and meditating on the qualities and  attributes of that absent-yet-present, regarded-and-regarding Person of  His.(8) Thus He makes a mention of Him whereof this is the purport:    \"Though the ocean of woe rageth on every side, and the bolts of fate  follow in quick succession, and the darkness of griefs and afflictions  invade soul and body, yet is My heart brightened by the remembrance of Thy  countenance and My soul is as a rosegarden from the perfume of Thy  nature.\"    In short, after He had remained for three months in the Castle of  _Ch_ihriq, the eminent doctors of Tabriz and scholars of A_dh_irbayjan  wrote to Tihran and demanded a severe punishment in regard to the Bab for  the intimidation and frightening of the people. When the Prime Minister  Haji Mirza Aqasi beheld the ferment and clamor of the learned doctors in  all districts of Persia, he perforce became their accomplice and ordered  Him to be brought from _Ch_ihriq to Tabriz. In the course of His transit  by Urumiyyih the governor of the district Qasim Mirza treated Him with  extraordinary deference, and a strange flocking together of high and low  was apparent. These conducted themselves with the utmost respectfulness.    When the Bab reached Tabriz they brought Him after some days before the  government tribunal. Of the learned doctors the Nizamu'l-'Ulama, Mulla  Muhammad-i-Mamaqani, Mirza Ahmad the Imam-Jum'ih, Mirza 'Ali-As_gh_ar the  _Sh_ay_kh_u'l-Islam, and several other divines were present. They asked  concerning the claims of the Bab. He advanced the claim of Mihdi-hood;  whereon a mighty tumult arose. Eminent doctors in overwhelming might  compassed Him on all sides, and such was the onset of orthodoxy that it  had been no great wonder if a mere youth had not withstood the mountain of  Elburz. They demanded proof. Without hesitation He recited texts, saying,  \"This is the permanent and most mighty proof.\" They criticized His  grammar. He adduced arguments from the Qur'an, setting forth therefrom  instances of similar infractions of the rules of grammar. So the assembly  broke up and the Bab returned to His own dwelling.    The heaven-cradled Crown-Prince was at that time governor of  A_dh_irbayjan. He pronounced no sentence with regard to the Bab, nor did  he desire to interfere with Him. The doctors, however, considered it  advisable at least to inflict a severe chastisement, and beating was  decided on. But none of the corps of farra_sh_es would agree to become the  instruments of the infliction of this punishment. So Mirza 'Ali-As_gh_ar  the _Sh_ay_kh_u'l-Islam, who was one of the noble Siyyids, brought Him to  his own house and applied the rods with his own hand. After this they sent  the Bab back to _Ch_ihriq and subjected Him to a strict confinement.    Now when the news of this beating, chastisement, imprisonment, and rigor  reached all parts of Persia, learned divines and esteemed lawyers who were  possessed of power and influence girt up the loins of endeavor for the  eradication and suppression of this sect, exerting their utmost efforts  therefore. And they wrote notice of their decision, to wit \"that this  person and his followers are in absolute error and are hurtful to Church  and State.\" And since the governors in Persia enjoyed the fullest  authority, in some provinces they followed this decision and united in  uprooting and dispersing the Babis. But the late King Muhammad _Sh_ah  acted with deliberation in this matter, reflecting, \"This Youth is of the  Pure Lineage and of the family of him addressed with 'were it not for  thee.' So long as no offensive actions which are incompatible with the  public peace and well-being proceed from him, the government should not  interfere with him.\" And whenever the learned doctors appealed to him from  the surrounding districts, he either gave no answer, or else commanded  them to act with deliberation.    Notwithstanding this, between eminent doctors and illustrious scholars and  those learned persons who were followers of the Bab opposition,  discussion, and strife did so increase that in some provinces they desired  [to resort to] mutual imprecation; and for the governors of the provinces,  too, a means of acquiring gain was produced, so that great tumult and  disturbance arose. And since the malady of the gout had violently attacked  the king's foot and occupied his world-ordering thought, the good judgment  of the Chief Minister, the famous Haji Mirza Aqasi, became the pivot of  the conduct of affairs, and his incapacity and lack of resource became  apparent as the sun. For every hour he formed a new opinion and gave a new  order: at one moment he would seek to support the decision of the doctors,  accounting the eradication and suppression of the Babis as necessary: at  another time he would charge the doctors with aggressiveness, regarding  undue interference as contrary to justice: at another time he would become  a mystic and say, \"All these voices are from the King,\"(9) or repeat with  his tongue, \"Moses is at war with Moses,\"(10) or recite, \"This is nought  but Thy trial.\"(11) In short this changeable minister, by reason of his  mismanagement of important matters and failure to control and order the  affairs of the community, so acted that disturbance and clamor arose from  all quarters and directions: the most notable and influential of the  doctors ordered the common folk to molest the followers of the Bab, and a  general onslaught took place. More especially when the claim of Mihdi-hood  reached the hearing of eminent divines and profound doctors they began to  make lamentation and to cry and complain from their pulpits, saying, \"One  of the essentials of religion and of the authentic traditions transmitted  from the holy Imams, nay, the chief basis of the foundations of the church  of His Highness Ja'far, is the Occultation of the immaculate twelfth Imam  (upon both of them be peace). What has happened to Jabulqa? Where has  Jabulsa gone? What was the Minor Occultation? What has become of the Major  Occultation? What are the sayings of Husayn ibn Ruh, and what the  tradition of Ibn Mihriyar? What shall we make of the flight of the  Guardians and the Helpers? How shall we deal with the conquest of the East  and the West? Where is the Ass of Antichrist? When will the appearance of  the Sufyan be? Where are the signs which are in the traditions of the Holy  Family? Where is that whereon the Victorious Church is agreed? The matter  is not outside one of two alternatives: either we must repudiate the  traditions of the Holy Imams, grow wearied of the Church of Ja'far, and  account the clear indications of the Imam as disturbed dreams; or, in  accordance with the primary and subsidiary doctrines of the Faith and the  essential and explicit declarations of the most luminous Law, we must  consider the repudiation, nay, the destruction of this person as our chief  duty. If so be that we shut our eyes to these authentic traditions and  obvious doctrines universally admitted, no remnant will endure of the  fundamental basis of the Church of the immaculate Imam: we shall neither  be Sunnites, nor shall we be of the prevalent sect to continue awaiting  the promised Saint and believing in the begotten Mihdi.(12) Otherwise we  must regard as admissible the opening of the Gate of Saintship, and  consider that He Who is to arise of the family of Muhammad possesses two  signs: the first condition, Holy Lineage; the second, [that He is  divinely] fortified with brilliant verses. What can we do with these  thousand-year-old beliefs of the delivered band of _Sh_i'ites, or what  shall we say concerning their profound doctors and preeminent divines?  Were all these in error? Did they journey in the vale of transgression?  What an evidently false assertion is this! By God, this is a thing to  break the back! O people, extinguish this fire and forget these words!  Alas! woe to our Faith, woe to our Law!\"    Thus did they make complaint in mosques and chapels, in pulpits and  congregations.    But the Babi chiefs composed treatises against them, and set in order  replies according to their own thought. Were these to be discussed in  detail it would conduce to prolixity, and our object is the statement of  history, not of arguments for believing or rejecting; but of some of the  replies the gist is this: that they held the Proof as supreme, and the  evidence as outweighing traditions, considering the former as the root and  the latter as the branch, and saying, \"If the branch agree not "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19312"],[0,"Tablets of Abdul-Baha Abbas (#3)"],[1,"the attraction of the Fragrances...\"     \"O thou who art commemorating the Name of God!...\"     \"O thou maid-servant of God!...\"     \"O thou who art remembered by Abdul-Baha!...\"     \"O thou whose heart is moved by a breeze blowing from...\"     \"O thou attracted maid-servant of God!...\"     \"O thou who art advancing to the Kingdom of God!...\"     \"O thou who dost believe in the Spirit of Christ, in the...\"     \"O ye who are considering the Kingdom of your august...\"     \"O ye two singing birds in the Garden of Belief!...\"     \"O thou who art turning unto the Kingdom of God!...\"     \"O ye two pilgrims of the Holy Shrine!...\"     \"O ye two lamps of the Love of God!...\"     \"O thou respectful soul!...\"     \"O thou faithful maid-servant of God!...\"     \"O thou attracted maid-servant of God!...\"     \"O thou beloved maid-servant of God!...\"     \"O maid-servant of God!...\"     \"O thou who art seeking for the Power of the Holy...\"     \"O thou maid-servant of God!...\"     \"O thou maid-servant of God!...\"     \"O thou who art attracted to the Light of the Kingdom!...\"     \"O thou who hast been attracted by the Magnet of the...\"     \"O thou whose heart hath been filled with the love of...\"     \"O thou who art turned to the Kingdom!...\"     \"My God!
