This journey will extend our knowledge of this  singular Saharan country, and may also be of advantage in procuring the  signature of the Sultan to a treaty of commerce.    _4th._--Dr. Barth started this morning in company with Hamma, Waled Ocht  En-Noor (son of the sister of En-Noor). The departure took place in  presence of the Sultan himself, who had come to take tea with me. The  caravan was at first composed of bullocks, the camels being a little in  advance on the road. Our friend the Doctor started astride on one of  these animals, which are a little difficult to manage, especially when  they have been out at grass for some time. Indeed, in the first place,  it is no easy matter to catch them from amongst the herds; then it is  hard to load them; and then, though not often, they refuse to proceed.  On this occasion a powerful brute proved absolutely unmanageable.  En-Noor, seeing its obstinacy, exclaimed that he gave it to me to kill  and eat. He afterwards, however, modified his gift, and said that the  bullock was also to be distributed amongst the Arabs of the caravans now  in Tintalous; and that we were to give a turban as a present to the  herdsman. I was told that, in the meantime, representation had been made  to him, to the effect that it was unfair to distinguish the Christians  in this manner. Soon after the animal was given it ran away, and no one  could catch it.    Well, the bullock caravan went off in good style; and Sultan En-Noor  remained taking his tea and eating English pickles and marmalade with  me. He drank the tea and ate the other delicacies with evident pleasure,  not being afraid, like the greater part of his subjects, to eat the food  of Christians. Possession of power seems to have one good effect--the  destruction of prejudice; pity that it sometimes goes further and  destroys belief. En-Noor told us that the Sultan of Asoudee had gone out  on a razzia to the west. We are obliged to hope that it will be  successful, as otherwise our affairs will most materially suffer. We  talked also of the state of Zinder, which is represented to be a walled  town, with seven gates built amidst and around some huge rocks. The  governor, Ibrahim, keeps fifty drummers at work every night, but whether  with a purpose superstitious or political I do not know.    En-Noor admired much the portraits of the personages who figure in the  accounts of the former expedition to this part of the world,  particularly that of Clapperton. He had also a wonderful story to tell  of this traveller's magic. He said that Abdallah (Clapperton's  travelling name) had learned from his books the site of his (En-Noor's)  father's house, that near it was a gold mine, and that he had intended  to come and give intelligence of this treasure. \"See!\" exclaimed the  Sultan, \"what wonderful things are written in the books of the  Christians!\"    My young fighi (or writer of charms) tells me, as a secret, that he  cannot write a talisman for himself, but must ask another of the  brotherhood to do this for him. Neither in this place can physicians  heal themselves. This civil youth made me a present of a piece of his  workmanship to-day, observing, \"There is great profit in its power; it  will preserve you from the cut of the sword and the firing of the gun.\"  I pray not to have occasion to test its efficacy, but hope it may also  serve as a protection from the bite of scorpions, which are so plentiful  about here, and are said, at this season, to jump like grasshoppers.  According to the people of Tintalous there are three species of them,  each distinguished by a different colour--black, red, and yellow.  Despite the talk of these disgusting reptiles I went in the evening to  see the wells which supply Tintalous with water. They are nothing more  than holes scooped out of the sand in the bed of the wady, and supplied  by _ma-el-matr_, \"rain-water,\" which collects only a few feet under the  sand, and passes through no minerals.    I afterwards proceeded to the encampment of the slave caravan, which is  going in a few days to Ghat. A native of that place--the chief,  indeed--was exceedingly rude at our first rencounter, and the following  dialogue took place:--    _The Ghatee._ Where are you going?    _Myself._ I am going to Sakkatou.    _The Ghatee._ What for?    _Myself._ To see the Sultan, who is my friend.    _The Ghatee._ How do you know him?    _Myself._ The English have known him for years past.    _The Ghatee._ Ah!    _Myself._ Yes.    _The Ghatee._ Have you any dollars--large dollars? (making a large  circle with his thumb and forefinger.)    _Myself._ No: I don't carry money to Soudan, which is of no use to me.  There I shall have wada.    _Ghatee._ Eh! Eh! But cannot you give me a turban?    _Myself._ No, I am not a merchant, I don't bring such things; go to the  Arab merchants and buy.    _Ghatee._ Um! Um!    _Myself._ Do you know Mohammed Kafa in Ghat?    _Ghatee._ Oh, yes!    _Myself._ He is my friend.    _Ghatee._ Allah!    _Myself._ Yes; he sent me a fine dinner twice whilst I was in Ghat.    _Ghatee._ Allah! Allah!    _Myself._ Do you know Haj Ibrahim? He is my great friend.    _Ghatee._ Allah! Allah! (greatly surprised).    _Myself._ Why, how is it that you do not know me, Yakob, as I have  been in Ghat many years before?    At this some of the other people of the caravan cried out, \"Yes, yes, we  all know Yakob;\" so that I left the rude slave-merchant quite  crest-fallen. He evidently, at first, wished to assume the airs of a  Haghar, and bully me out of a present.    The caravan consisted of some thirty poor young women and children.  There was also with them a small quantity of elephants' teeth.    Now that the moon is absent and the nights are clear we have a most  splendid view of the heavens, its stars and constellations. The number  of meteors darting to and fro overhead is very great--nearly one a  minute shoots along. Some are only a faint glimmer, and have but the  existence of a moment, whilst others are very beautiful and last several  seconds.    _5th._--The weather is improving; the strong gusts of wind have ceased,  and so has the rain. We have now calm and fine days with moderate heat.    In the afternoon I received another visit from En-Noor, who came  straight into my tent, like an old friend whom I had known for twenty  years. He stopped with me at least an hour, drinking tea and smoking,  chatting the while about his past history and present affairs. He  reiterated again assurances of his friendship for the English, and his  determination to remain the ally of the Queen of England! He referred to  the time when the great Bello, sultan of Sakkatou, sent his ambassador  to request him (En-Noor) and all his people to subject themselves to the  Fellatahs. En-Noor gave him for answer, \"I am under God, the servant of  God, and shall not submit myself to you or to any one upon earth. My  father, and grandfather, and great-grandfather, and all my ancestors,  ruled here, and were the servants of God, and I shall follow in their  steps.\" The Fellatahs then tried to seduce the people, but they all  said, \"We have one Sultan, that is En-Noor.\" All the other authorities  of Aheer followed the example, and preserved their independence, the  people everywhere arming themselves with whatever weapons they had in  case a war should break out.    After this narrative, En-Noor spoke again of the English, and said he  should send a maharee for the Queen.    I gave him a fancy ring of the value of threepence, with a mock diamond  in it, which he immediately put on his finger with as much glee and  pride as the gayest Parisian coquette. Yusuf and the Sfaxee, being  present, swore it was _diamanti_; but I am quite sure the old Sheikh  understood the compliment. I also gave him a pair of bellows, a basin,  and a pint bottle with a little oil it; with all these things he was  greatly delighted, continually admiring and trying the bellows. When he  went out of the tent he himself carried all these articles away under  his arm.    With reference to our wish to start for Zinder, the Sultan says he will  send immediately for the boat, that it may be ready by the time Dr.  Barth returns from Aghadez, when he is determined himself to take that  route. He seems now in the enjoyment of good health. I felt much  satisfied with his visit. Certainly, when I reflect that in the northern  frontier of Aheer we were pursued for several days, like monsters not  fit to live, by armed bands, this appears to me extraordinary  condescension on the part of En-Noor. I hope we shall part in a friendly  manner. This worthy sovereign gives the present Sultan of Sakkatou, Ali  Bello, the character of a miser, but says that his father was a man of  liberality. He cannot exceed En-Noor himself in greediness.    The bad state of the Bornou route is accounted for by the desire the  Kailouees have to render it unsafe, so that they may have all the  caravans come along their own route. The same thing is said of the  Timbuctoo route from Soudan. The Haghar murder all who attempt to go  from Soudan to Timbuctoo, in order that the caravans may pass Ghat and  Tuat. This is called the natural explanation of the bad character of  these routes.    _6th._--I continue to record the few characteristic incidents of my  residence at Tintalous. Our bullock has been at last killed. We could  not catch him, but shot him down. The carcase was divided between no  less than twenty persons, and the meat proved to be pretty good. Of my  share I made steaks, which I washed down with some tea and rum. This is  the first time we have had fresh beef since leaving Tripoli. The event  created an immense sensation throughout the whole town of Tintalous, for  the slaughter of a bullock does not take place there every day.    This morning I administered two ounces of Epsom salts to a good-"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18556"],[0,"Catalogue of Violent and Destructive Earthquakes in the Philippines (#3)"],[1," the Provinces of the Ilocos, of      |                    |     |Cagayan, and the Cordillera Central.
