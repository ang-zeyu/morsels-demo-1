On a merely superficial acquaintance the Japanese craft of  block-printing may appear to be no more than a primitive though delicate  form of colour reproduction, which modern mechanical methods have long  superseded, even in the land of its invention; and that to study so  limited a mode of expression would be hardly of any practical value to  an artist. Moreover, the craft is under the disadvantage that all the  stages of the work, from making the first design to taking the final  impressions, must be done by the artist himself--work which includes the  delicate cutting of line and planning of colour blocks, and the  preparation of colour and paper. In Japan there were trained craftsmen  expert in each of these branches of the craft, and each carried out  his part under the supervision of the artist. No part but the design was  done by him. So that the very character of the work has an essential  difference. Under our present conditions the artist must undertake the  whole craft, with all its detail.    [Illustration: Plate II.--Key-block of the print shown on the  frontispiece.    (The portion of wood lying outside the points of the mass of foliage is  left standing to support the paper, but is not inked in printing.)    (_To face page 5._)]    Simple as the process is, there is, from first to last, a long labour  involved in planning, cutting and printing, before a satisfactory batch  of prints is produced. After several attempts in delegating printing to  well-trained pupils I have found it impossible to obtain the best  results by that means, but the cutting of the colour-blocks and the  clearing of the key-block after the first cutting of the line may well  be done by assistant craftsmen.    A larger demand for the prints might bring about a commercial  development of the work, and the consequent employment of trained  craftsmen or craftswomen, but the result would be a different one from  that which has been obtained by the artists who are willing to  undertake the whole production of their work.    The actual value of wood-block prints for use as decoration is a matter  of personal taste and experience.    In my own opinion there is an element that always remains foreign in the  prints of the Japanese masters, yet I know of no other kind of art that  has the same telling value on a wall, or the same decorative charm in  modern domestic rooms as the wood-block print. A single print well  placed in a room of quiet colour will enrich and dominate a whole wall.    The modern vogue still favours more expensive although less decorative  forms of art, or works of reproduction without colour, yet here is an  art available to all who care for expressive design and colour, and  within the means of the large public to whom the cost of pictures is  prohibitive. In its possibility as a decorative means of expression well  suited to our modern needs and uses, and in the particular charm that  colour has when printed from wood on a paper that is beautiful already  by its own quality, there is no doubt of the scope and opportunity  offered by this art.    But as with new wine and old bottles, a new condition of simplicity in  furniture and of pure colour in decoration must first be established. A  wood-block print will not tell well amid a wilderness of bric-a-brac or  on a gaudy wall-paper.    From another and quite different point of view, the art of block-cutting  and colour-printing has, however, a special and important value. To any  student of pictorial art, especially to any who may wish to design for  modern printed decoration, no work gives such instruction in economy of  design, in the resources of line and its expressive development, and in  the use and behaviour of colour. This has been the expressed opinion of  many who have undertaken a course of wood-block printing for this object  alone.    The same opinion is emphatically stated by Professor Emil Orlik, whose  prints are well known in modern exhibitions. On the occasion of a visit  to the Kunstgewerbeschule of Berlin, I found him conducting a class for  designers for printed decoration, in which the Japanese craft of  block-printing was made the basis of their training. He held to the view  that the primitive craft teaches the students the very economy and  simplicity upon which the successful use of the great modern resources  of colour-printing depend, yet which cannot be learnt except by recourse  to simpler conditions and more narrow limitations before dealing with  the greater scope of the machine.    My own experience also convinces me that whatever may be the ultimate  value of the Eastern craft to our artists as a mode of personal  expression, there is no doubt of its effect and usefulness in training  students to design with economy and simplicity for modern printing  processes.          CHAPTER II           General Description of the Operation of Printing from a Set of       Blocks    The early stages of any craft are more interesting when we are familiar  with the final result. For this reason it is often an advantage to begin  at the end.    To see a few impressions taken from a set of blocks in colour printing,  or to print them oneself, gives the best possible idea of the quality  and essential character of print-making. So also in describing the work  it will perhaps tend to make the various stages clearer if the final act  of printing is first explained.    The most striking characteristic of this craft is the primitive  simplicity of the act of printing. No press is required, and no  machinery.    A block is laid flat on the table with its cut surface uppermost, and is  kept steady by a small wad of damp paper placed under each corner. A  pile of paper slightly damped ready for printing lies within reach just  beyond the wood-block, so that the printer may easily lift the paper  sheet by sheet on to the block as it is required.    It is the practice in Japan to work squatting on the floor, with the  blocks and tools also on the floor in front of the craftsman. Our own  habit of working at a table is less simple, but has some advantages. One  practice or habit of the Japanese is, however, to be followed with  particular care. No description can give quite fully the sense of  extreme orderliness and careful deliberation of their work. Everything  is placed where it will be most convenient for use, and this orderliness  is preserved throughout the day's work. Their shapely tools and vessels  are handled with a deftness that shames our clumsy ways, and everything  that they use is kept quite clean. This skilful orderliness is essential  to fine craftmanship, and is a sign of mastery.      The arrangement of tools and vessels on a work-table may be as the  accompanying plan shows:    [Illustration: FIG. 1.--Plan of work-table.      A. Block.    B. Sheets of damped paper lying on a board.    C. Second board lifted from B.    D. Brushes lying on a strip of wood.    E. White plate or dish containing colour.    F. Saucer containing paste of rice-flour.    G. Baren, or printing pad, lying on a sheet of paper    slightly oiled with sweet oil and tacked to    the table.    H. Deep bowl of water and brush for moistening    the damping sheets.    I. Saucer of water for use in printing.    J. Sponge.]    When printing on a table arranged in this way the board lying on the  sheets of damped paper at B is first lifted off and placed at C to  receive the sheets as they are done. If the block A is quite dry, it is  thoroughly moistened with a damp sponge and wiped. The colour from a  saucer, E, is then brushed over the printing surface thinly, and a trace  of paste taken from F is also brushed into the colour. (This is best  done after the colour is roughly spread on the block.) The brush is laid  down in its place, D, and the top sheet of paper from the pile is  immediately lifted to its register marks (notches to keep the paper in  its place) on the block. The manner of holding the paper is shown on  page 70. This must be done deftly, and it is important to waste no time,  as the colour would soon dry on the exposed block and print badly.    Pressure is then applied to the back of the paper as it lies on the wet  block. This is done by a round pad called the _baren_ by the Japanese.  It is made of a coil of cord covered by bamboo sheath as shown later  on page 62. The pad is rubbed by hand with considerable pressure, moving  transversely forwards and backwards across the block, working from the  left to the right. Once all over the block should be enough. The paper  is then lifted off and laid face upwards on the board at C. The block is  then re-charged with colour for another impression, and the whole  operation repeated as many times as there are sheets to be printed.    [Illustration: Plate III. The Baren, or printing pad.    (The pad is actually 5 inches in diameter.)    (_To face page 12._)]    When this is done all the sheets will have received a single impression,  which may be either a patch of colour or an impression in line of part  of the design of the print. The block A is then removed, cleaned, and  put away; and the block for the second impression put in its place.    It is usual to print the line or key-block of a design first, as one is  then able to detect faulty registering or imperfect fitting of the  blocks and to correct them at once. But there are cases in which a  gradated tone, such as a sky, may need to be printed before the line  block.    The complete design of a print may require several blocks for colour as  well as the key block which prints the line. The impressions from all  these blocks may be printed one after another without waiting for the  colour on the paper to dry.    As soon as the batch of damped sheets has been passed over the first  block, the sheets are replaced at B between boards, and, if necessary,  damped again by means of damping"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/202"],[0,"My Bondage and My Freedom (#3)"],[1,"day, at Nantucket,  that he, diffidently and reluctantly, was led to address an anti-slavery  meeting. He was about the age when the younger Pitt entered the House of  Commons; like Pitt, too, he stood up a born orator.    William Lloyd Garrison, who was happily present, writes thus of Mr.  Douglass' maiden effort; \"I shall never forget his first speech at the  convention--the extraordinary emotion it excited in my own mind--the  powerful impression it created upon a crowded auditory, completely taken  by surprise. * * * I think I never hated slavery so intensely as at  that moment; certainly, my perception of the enormous outrage which is  inflicted by it on the godlike nature of its victims, was rendered  far more clear than ever. There stood one in physical proportions and  stature commanding and exact--in intellect richly endowed--in natural  eloquence a prodigy.\"  [1]    It is of interest to compare Mr. Douglass's account of this meeting with  Mr. Garrison's. Of the two, I think the latter the most correct. It must  have been a grand burst of eloquence! The pent up agony, indignation and  pathos of an abused and harrowed boyhood and youth, bursting out in all  their freshness and overwhelming earnestness!    This unique introduction to its great leader, led immediately{10} to  the employment of Mr. Douglass as an agent by the American Anti-Slavery  Society. So far as his self-relying and independent character would  permit, he became, after the strictest sect, a Garrisonian. It is not  too much to say, that he formed a complement which they needed, and they  were a complement equally necessary to his \"make-up.\" With his deep and  keen sensitiveness to wrong, and his wonderful memory, he came from the  land of bondage full of its woes and its evils, and painting them in  characters of living light; and, on his part, he found, told out in  sound Saxon phrase, all those principles of justice and right and  liberty, which had dimly brooded over the dreams of his youth, seeking  definite forms and verbal expression. It must have been an electric  flashing of thought, and a knitting of soul, granted to but few in this  life, and will be a life-long memory to those who participated in it. In  the society, moreover, of Wendell Phillips, Edmund Quincy, William  Lloyd Garrison, and other men of earnest faith and refined culture, Mr.  Douglass enjoyed the high advantage of their assistance and counsel in  the labor of self-culture, to which he now addressed himself with wonted  energy. Yet, these gentlemen, although proud of Frederick Douglass,  failed to fathom, and bring out to the light of day, the highest  qualities of his mind; the force of their own education stood in  their own way: they did not delve into the mind of a colored man for  capacities which the pride of race led them to believe to be restricted  to their own Saxon blood. Bitter and vindictive sarcasm, irresistible  mimicry, and a pathetic narrative of his own experiences of slavery,  were the intellectual manifestations which they encouraged him to  exhibit on the platform or in the lecture desk.    A visit to England, in 1845, threw Mr. Douglass among men and women of  earnest souls and high culture, and who, moreover, had never drank of  the bitter waters of American caste. For the first time in his life, he  breathed an atmosphere congenial to the longings of his spirit, and felt  his manhood free and{11} unrestricted. The cordial and manly greetings  of the British and Irish audiences in public, and the refinement and  elegance of the social circles in which he mingled, not only as an  equal, but as a recognized man of genius, were, doubtless, genial and  pleasant resting places in his hitherto thorny and troubled journey  through life. There are joys on the earth, and, to the wayfaring  fugitive from American slavery or American caste, this is one of them.    But his sojourn in England was more than a joy to Mr. Douglass. Like  the platform at Nantucket, it awakened him to the consciousness of new  powers that lay in him. From the pupilage of Garrisonism he rose to the  dignity of a teacher and a thinker; his opinions on the broader aspects  of the great American question were earnestly and incessantly sought,  from various points of view, and he must, perforce, bestir himself to  give suitable answer. With that prompt and truthful perception which  has led their sisters in all ages of the world to gather at the feet  and support the hands of reformers, the gentlewomen of England [2] were  foremost to encourage and strengthen him to carve out for himself a path  fitted to his powers and energies, in the life-battle against slavery  and caste to which he was pledged. And one stirring thought, inseparable  from the British idea of the evangel of freedom, must have smote his ear  from every side--            _Hereditary bondmen! know ye not          Who would be free, themselves mast strike the blow?_      The result of this visit was, that on his return to the United States,  he established a newspaper. This proceeding was sorely against the  wishes and the advice of the leaders of the American Anti-Slavery  Society, but our author had fully grown up to the conviction of a truth  which they had once promulged, but now{12} forgotten, to wit: that in  their own elevation--self-elevation--colored men have a blow to strike  \"on their own hook,\" against slavery and caste. Differing from his  Boston friends in this matter, diffident in his own abilities, reluctant  at their dissuadings, how beautiful is the loyalty with which he still  clung to their principles in all things else, and even in this.    Now came the trial hour. Without cordial support from any large body of  men or party on this side the Atlantic, and too far distant in space and  immediate interest to expect much more, after the much already done,  on the other side, he stood up, almost alone, to the arduous labor and  heavy expenditure of editor and lecturer. The Garrison party, to which  he still adhered, did not want a _colored_ newspaper--there was an odor  of _caste_ about it; the Liberty party could hardly be expected to give  warm support to a man who smote their principles as with a hammer;  and the wide gulf which separated the free colored people from the  Garrisonians, also separated them from their brother, Frederick  Douglass.    The arduous nature of his labors, from the date of the establishment of  his paper, may be estimated by the fact, that anti-slavery papers in the  United States, even while organs of, and when supported by, anti-slavery  parties, have, with a single exception, failed to pay expenses. Mr.  Douglass has maintained, and does maintain, his paper without the  support of any party, and even in the teeth of the opposition of those  from whom he had reason to expect counsel and encouragement. He has been  compelled, at one and the same time, and almost constantly, during the  past seven years, to contribute matter to its columns as editor, and  to raise funds for its support as lecturer. It is within bounds to say,  that he has expended twelve thousand dollars of his own hard earned  money, in publishing this paper, a larger sum than has been contributed  by any one individual for the general advancement of the colored people.  There had been many other papers published and edited by colored men,  beginning as far back as{13} 1827, when the Rev. Samuel E. Cornish and  John B. Russworm (a graduate of Bowdoin college, and afterward Governor  of Cape Palmas) published the _Freedom's Journal_, in New York City;  probably not less than one hundred newspaper enterprises have been  started in the United States, by free colored men, born free, and some  of them of liberal education and fair talents for this work; but, one  after another, they have fallen through, although, in several instances,  anti-slavery friends contributed to their support. [3] It had almost  been given up, as an impracticable thing, to maintain a colored  newspaper, when Mr. Douglass, with fewest early advantages of all his  competitors, essayed, and has proved the thing perfectly practicable,  and, moreover, of great public benefit. This paper, in addition to its  power in holding up the hands of those to whom it is especially  devoted, also affords irrefutable evidence of the justice, safety and  practicability of Immediate Emancipation; it further proves the immense  loss which slavery inflicts on the land while it dooms such energies as  his to the hereditary degradation of slavery.    It has been said in this Introduction, that Mr. Douglass had raised  himself by his own efforts to the highest position in society. As a  successful editor, in our land, he occupies this position. Our editors  rule the land, and he is one of them. As an orator and thinker, his  position is equally high, in the opinion of his countrymen. If a  stranger in the United States would seek its most distinguished men--the  movers of public opinion--he will find their names mentioned, and their  movements chronicled, under the head of \"BY MAGNETIC TELEGRAPH,\" in the  daily papers. The keen caterers for the public attention, set down, in  this column, such men only as have won high mark in the public esteem.  During the past winter--1854-5--very frequent mention of Frederick  Douglass was made under this head in the daily papers; his name glided  as often--this week from Chicago, next{14} week from Boston--over the  lightning wires, as the name of any other man, of whatever note. To no  man did the people more widely nor more earnestly say, _\"Tell me thy  thought!\"_ And, somehow or other, revolution seemed to follow in his  wake. His were not the mere words of eloquence which Kossuth speaks  of, that delight the ear and then pass away. No! They were _work_-able,  _do_-able words, that brought forth fruits in the revolution in  Illinois, and in the passage of the franchise resolutions by the  Assembly of New"]]]
