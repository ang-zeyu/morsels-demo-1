BOOK I.          CHAP. I.      Ever since 1807, when the space between the Rhine and the Niemen had  been overrun, the two great empires of which these rivers were the  boundaries had become rivals. By his concessions at Tilsit, at the  expense of Prussia, Sweden, and Turkey, Napoleon had only satisfied  Alexander. That treaty was the result of the defeat of Russia, and the  date of her submission to the continental system. Among the Russians, it  was regarded by some as attacking their honour; and by all it was felt  to be ruinous to their interests.    By the continental system Napoleon had declared eternal war against the  English; to that system he attached his honour, his political existence,  and that of the nation under his sway. That system banished from the  Continent all merchandise which was English, or had paid duty in any  shape to England. He could not succeed in establishing it but by the  unanimous consent of the continental nations, and that consent could not  be hoped for but under a single and universal dominion.    France had besides alienated the nations of Europe from her by her  conquests, and the monarchs by her revolution and her new dynasty.  Henceforward she could no longer look forward to have either friends or  rivals, but merely subjects; for the first would have been false, and  the second implacable: it followed that all must be subject to her, or  she to all.    With feelings of this kind, her leader, influenced by his position, and  urged on by his enterprising character, filled his imagination with the  vast project of becoming the sole master of Europe, by overwhelming  Russia, and wresting Poland from her dominion. He had so much difficulty  in concealing this project, that hints of it began to escape him in all  directions. The immense preparations which so distant an enterprise  required, the enormous quantities of provisions and ammunition  collecting, the noise of arms, of carriages, and the march of such  numbers of soldiers--the universal movement the majestic and terrible  course of all the forces of the West against the East--every thing  announced to Europe that her two colossuses were about to measure their  strength with each other.    But, to get within reach of Russia, it was necessary to go beyond  Austria, to cross Prussia, and to march between Sweden and Turkey; an  offensive alliance with these four powers was therefore indispensable.  Austria was as much subject to the influence of Napoleon as Prussia was  to his arms: to them he had only to declare his intentions; Austria  voluntarily and eagerly entered into his plans, and Prussia he easily  prevailed on to join him.    Austria, however, did not act blindly. Situated between the two great  colossuses of the North and the West, she was not displeased to see them  at war: she looked to their mutually weakening each other, and to the  increase of her own strength by their exhaustion. On the 14th of March,  1812, she promised France 30,000 men; but she prepared prudent secret  instructions for them. She obtained a vague promise of an increase of  territory, as an indemnity for her share of the expenses of the war, and  the possession of Gallicia was guaranteed to her. She admitted, however,  the future possibility of a cession of part of that province to the  kingdom of Poland; but in exchange for that she would have received the  Illyrian provinces. The sixth article of the secret treaty establishes  that fact.    The success of the war, therefore, in no degree depended on the cession  of Gallicia, or the difficulties arising from the Austrian jealousy of  that possession. Napoleon, consequently, might on his entrance into  Wilna, have publicly proclaimed the liberation of the whole of Poland,  instead of betraying the expectations of her people, astonishing and  rendering them indifferent by expressions of wavering import.    This, however, was one of those prominent points, which in politics as  well as in war are decisive, with which every thing is connected, and  from which nothing ought to have made him swerve. But whether it was  that Napoleon reckoned too much on the ascendancy of his genius, or the  strength of his army, and the weakness of Alexander; or that,  considering what he left behind him, he felt it too dangerous to carry  on so distant a war slowly and methodically; or whether, as we shall  presently be told by himself, he had doubts of the success of his  undertaking; certain it is, that he either neglected, or could not yet  determine to proclaim the liberation of that country whose freedom he  had come to restore.    And yet he had sent an ambassador to her Diet. When this inconsistency  was remarked to him, he replied, that \"that nomination was an act of  war, which only bound him during the war, while by his words he would be  bound both in war and peace.\" Thus it was, that he made no other reply  to the enthusiasm of the Lithuanians than evasive expressions, at the  very time he was following up his attack on Alexander to the very  capital of his empire.    He even neglected to clear the southern Polish provinces of the feeble  hostile armies which kept the patriotism of their inhabitants in check,  and to secure, by strongly organizing their insurrection, a solid basis  of operation. Accustomed to short methods, and to rapid attacks, he  wished to imitate himself, in spite of the difference of places and  circumstances; for such is the weakness of man, that he is always led  by imitation, either of others, or of himself, which in the latter case,  that of great men, is habit; for habit is nothing more than the  imitation of one's self. So true it is, that by their strongest side  these extraordinary men are undone!    The one in question committed himself to the fortune of battles. Having  prepared an army of six hundred and fifty thousand men, he fancied that  that was doing sufficient to secure victory, from which he expected  every thing. Instead of sacrificing every thing to obtain victory, it  was by that he looked to obtain every thing; he made use of it as a  _means_, when it ought to have been his _end_. In this manner he made it  too necessary; it was already rather too much so. But he confided so  much of futurity to it, he overloaded it with so much responsibility,  that it became urgent and indispensable to him. Hence his precipitation  to get within reach of it, in order to extricate himself from so  critical a position.    But we must not be too hasty in condemning a genius so great and  universal; we shall shortly hear from himself by what urgent necessity  he was hurried on; and even admitting that the rapidity of his  expedition was only equalled by its rashness, success would have  probably crowned it, if the premature decline of his health had left the  physical constitution of this great man all the vigour which his mind  still retained.          CHAP. II.      As to Prussia, of which Napoleon was completely master, it is not known  whether it was from his uncertainty as to the fate which he reserved for  her, or as to the period at which he should commence the war, that he  refused, in 1811, to contract the alliance which she herself proposed to  him, and of which he dictated the conditions, in 1812. "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18127"],[0,"The Beginner's American History (#3)"],[1," shouting to each other that Columbus, the great navigator,  had crossed the \"Sea of Darkness\" and had returned in safety.    The king and queen were then in the city of Barcelona,[17] a long  distance from Palos. To that city Columbus now went. He entered it  on horseback, attended by the proudest and richest noblemen of Spain.  He brought with him six Indians from the West Indies. They were gaily  painted and wore bright feathers in their hair. Then a number of men  followed, carrying rare birds and plants, with gold and silver  ornaments, all found in the New World. These were presents for the  king and queen. Ferdinand and Isabella received Columbus with great  honor. When he had told them the story of his wonderful voyage, they  sank on their knees and gave praise to God; all who were present  followed their example.    [Illustration: COLUMBUS RECEIVED BY THE KING AND QUEEN OF SPAIN.]    [Footnote 17: Barcelona (Bar-se-lo'na); see map in paragraph 12.]      17. The last voyages of Columbus.--Columbus made three more voyages  across the Atlantic. He discovered more islands near the coast of  America, and he touched the coast of Central America and of South  America, but that was all. He never set foot on any part of what is  now the United States, and he always thought that the land he had  reached was part of Asia. He had found a new world, but he did not  know it: all that he knew was how to get to it and how to show others  the way.    [Illustration: The light parts of this map show how much of America  Columbus discovered. (The long island is Cuba; the large one to the  right is San Domingo.)]      18. Columbus in his old age.--The last days of this great man were  very sorrowful. The king was disappointed because he brought back  no gold to amount to anything. The Spanish governor of San Domingo  hated Columbus, and when he landed at that island on one of his  voyages, he arrested him and sent him back to Spain in chains. He  was at once set at liberty; but he could not forget the insult. He  kept the chains hanging on the wall of his room, and asked to have  them buried with him.    Columbus was now an old man; his health was broken, he was poor, in  debt, and without a home. Once he wrote to the king and queen, saying,  \"I have not a hair upon me that is not gray, my body is weak, and  all that was left to me ... has been taken away and sold, even to  the coat which I wore.\"    Not long after he had come back to Spain to stay, the queen died.  Then Columbus felt that he had lost his best friend. He gave up hope,  and said, \"I have done all that I could do: I leave the rest to God.\"      19. His death and burial.--Columbus died full of disappointment and  sorrow--perhaps it would not be too much to say that he died of a  broken heart.    He was at first buried in Spain; then his body was taken up and carried  to San Domingo, where he had wished to be buried. Whether it rests  there to-day, or whether it was carried to Havana[18] and deposited  in the cathedral or great church of that city, no one can positively  say. But wherever the grave of the great sailor may be, his memory  will live in every heart capable of respecting a brave man; for he  first dared to cross the \"Sea of Darkness,\" and he discovered  America.    [Illustration: MONUMENT TO COLUMBUS. (In the Cathedral of Havana,  Cuba.)]    [Footnote 18: Havana (Ha-van'ah): a city of Cuba.]      20. Summary.--In 1492 Christopher Columbus set sail from Spain to  find a direct way across the Atlantic to Asia and the Indies. He did  not get to Asia; but he did better; he discovered America. He died  thinking that the new lands he had found were part of Asia; but by  his daring voyage he first showed the people of Europe how to get  to the New World.      When and where was Columbus born? What did he do when he was fourteen?  What about his sea-fight? What did he do in Lisbon? How much of the  world was then known? How did Columbus think he could reach Asia and  the Indies? Why did he want to go there? What did he try to do in  Portugal? Why did he go to Spain? Where did he first go in Spain?  How did Columbus get help at last? When did he sail? What happened  on the first part of the voyage? What happened after that? What is  said about signs of land? What about the discovery of land? What did  Columbus name the island? What did he find on it? What is said of  other islands? What is said of the return of Columbus to Spain? What  about the last voyages of Columbus? Did he ever land on any part of  what is now the United States? What about his old age? What is said  of his death and burial?          JOHN CABOT[1]  (Lived in England from 1472-1498).      21. John Cabot discovers the _continent_ of North America.--At the  time that Columbus set out on his first voyage across the Atlantic  in 1492, John Cabot, an Italian merchant, was living in the city of  Bristol,[2] England. When the news reached that city that Columbus  had discovered the West Indies, Cabot begged Henry the Seventh, king  of England, to let him see if he could not find a shorter way to the  Indies than that of Columbus. The king gave his consent, and in the  spring of 1497 John Cabot, with his son Sebastian,[3] who seems to  have been born in Bristol, sailed from that port. They headed their  vessels toward the northwest; by going in that direction they hoped  to get to those parts of Asia and the Spice Islands which were known  to Europe, and which Columbus had failed to reach.    [Illustration: Map showing the city of Venice, Italy, where John  Cabot had lived.]    Early one bright morning toward the last of June, 1497, they saw land  in the west. It was probably Cape Breton[4] Island, a part of Nova  Scotia.[5] John Cabot named it \"The Land First Seen.\" Up to this time  Columbus had discovered nothing but the West India Islands, but John  Cabot now saw the continent of North America; no civilized man[6]  had ever seen it before. There it lay, a great, lonely land, shaggy  with forests, with not a house or a human being in sight.    [Illustration: Map showing Nova Scotia.]    [Footnote 1: Cabot (Cab'ot).]    [Footnote 2: See map in paragraph 62.]    [Footnote 3: Sebastian (Se-bast'yan).]    [Footnote 4: Breton (Bret'on).]    [Footnote 5: Nova Scotia (No'vah Sko'she-a).]    [Footnote 6: The Northmen: an uncivilized people of Norway and  Denmark discovered the continent of North America about five hundred  years before Cabot did. Nothing came of this discovery, and when  Cabot sailed, no one seems to have known anything about what the  Northmen had done so long before.]      22. John Cabot takes possession of the country for the king of  England.--Cabot went on shore with his son and some of his crew. In  the vast, silent wilderness they set up a large cross. Near to it  they planted two flag-poles, and hoisted the English flag on one and  the flag of Venice,[7] the city where John Cabot had lived in Italy,  on the other. Then they took possession of the land for Henry the  Seventh. It was in this way that the English came to consider that  the eastern coast of North America was their property, although they  did not begin to make settlements here until nearly a hundred years  later.    [Illustration: LANDING OF THE CABOTS.]    [Footnote 7: Venice (Ven'is).]      23. John Cabot and his son return to Bristol.--After sailing about  the Gulf of St. Lawrence without finding the passage through to Asia  for which they were looking, the voyagers returned to England.    The king was so pleased with what John Cabot had discovered that he  made him a handsome present; and when the captain, richly dressed  in silk, appeared in the street, the people of Bristol would \"run  after him like mad\" and hurrah for the \"Great Admiral,\" as they called  him.      24. What the Cabots carried back to England from America.--The Cabots  carried back to England some Indian traps for catching game and  perhaps some wild turkeys--an American bird the English had then  never seen, but whose acquaintance they were not sorry to make. They  also carried over the rib of a whale which they had found on the beach  in Nova Scotia.    Near where the Cabots probably lived in Bristol there is a famous  old church.[8] It was built long before the discovery of America,  and Queen Elizabeth said that it was the most beautiful building of  its kind in all England. In that church hangs the rib of a whale.  It is believed to be the one the Cabots brought home with them. It  reminds all who see it of that voyage in 1497 by which England got  possession of a very large part of the continent of North America.    [Footnote 8: The church of St. Mary Redcliffe.]      25. The second voyage of the Cabots; how they sailed along the eastern  shores of North America.--About a year later the Cabots set out on  a second voyage to the west. They reached the gloomy cliffs of  Labrador[9] on the northeastern coast of America, and they passed  many immense icebergs. They saw numbers of Indians dressed in the  skins of wild beasts, and polar bears white as snow. These bears were  great swimmers, and would dive into the sea and come up with a large  fish in their claws. As it did not look to the Cabots as if the polar  bears and the icebergs would guide them to the warm countries of Asia  and the Spice Islands, they turned about and went south. They sailed  along what is now the eastern coast of the United States for a very  long distance; but not finding any passage through to the countries  they were seeking, they returned to England.    [Illustration: Map showing how much of the continent of North America  was discovered by the Cabots.]    The English now began to see what an immense extent of land they had  found beyond the Atlantic. They could not tell, however, whether it  was a continent by itself or a part of Asia. Like everybody in Europe,  they called it the New World, but all that name really meant then  was simply the New Lands"]]]
