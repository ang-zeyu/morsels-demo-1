In this sense, therefore, any song that came  from such a group would be the joint product of a number of them,  telling perhaps the story of some stampede they had all fought to  turn, some crime in which they had all shared equally, some comrade's  tragic death which they had all witnessed. The song-making did not  cease as the men went up the trail. Indeed the songs were here  utilized for very practical ends. Not only were sharp, rhythmic  yells--sometimes beaten into verse--employed to stir up lagging  cattle, but also during the long watches the night-guards, as they  rode round and round the herd, improvised cattle lullabies which  quieted the animals and soothed them to sleep. Some of the best of the  so-called \"dogie songs\" seem to have been created for the purpose of  preventing cattle stampedes,--such songs coming straight from the  heart of the cowboy, speaking familiarly to his herd in the stillness  of the night.    The long drives up the trail occupied months, and called for  sleepless vigilance and tireless activity both day and night. When at  last a shipping point was reached, the cattle marketed or loaded on  the cars, the cowboys were paid off. It is not surprising that the  consequent relaxation led to reckless deeds. The music, the dancing,  the click of the roulette ball in the saloons, invited; the lure of  crimson lights was irresistible. Drunken orgies, reactions from months  of toil, deprivation, and loneliness on the ranch and on the trail,  brought to death many a temporarily crazed buckaroo. To match this  dare-deviltry, a saloon man in one frontier town, as a sign for his  business, with psychological ingenuity painted across the broad front  of his building in big black letters this challenge to God, man, and  the devil: _The Road to Ruin_. Down this road, with swift and eager  footsteps, has trod many a pioneer viking of the West. Quick to resent  an insult real or fancied, inflamed by unaccustomed drink, the ready  pistol always at his side, the tricks of the professional gambler to  provoke his sense of fair play, and finally his own wild recklessness  to urge him on,--all these combined forces sometimes brought him into  tragic conflict with another spirit equally heedless and daring. Not  nearly so often, however, as one might suppose, did he die with his  boots on. Many of the most wealthy and respected citizens now living  in the border states served as cowboys before settling down to quiet  domesticity.    A cow-camp in the seventies generally contained several types of  men. It was not unusual to find a negro who, because of his ability to  handle wild horses or because of his skill with a lasso, had been  promoted from the chuck-wagon to a place in the ranks of the cowboys.  Another familiar figure was the adventurous younger son of some  British family, through whom perhaps became current the English  ballads found in the West. Furthermore, so considerable was the number  of men who had fled from the States because of grave imprudence or  crime, it was bad form to inquire too closely about a person's real  name or where he came from. Most cowboys, however, were bold young  spirits who emigrated to the West for the same reason that their  ancestors had come across the seas. They loved roving; they loved  freedom; they were pioneers by instinct; an impulse set their faces  from the East, put the tang for roaming in their veins, and sent them  ever, ever westward.    That the cowboy was brave has come to be axiomatic. If his life of  isolation made him taciturn, it at the same time created a spirit of  hospitality, primitive and hearty as that found in the mead-halls of  Beowulf. He faced the wind and the rain, the snow of winter, the  fearful dust-storms of alkali desert wastes, with the same uncomplaining  quiet. Not all his work was on the ranch and the trail. To the cowboy,  more than to the goldseekers, more than to Uncle Sam's soldiers, is  due the conquest of the West. Along his winding cattle trails the  Forty-Niners found their way to California. The cowboy has fought  back the Indians ever since ranching became a business and as long as  Indians remained to be fought. He played his part in winning the great  slice of territory that the United States took away from Mexico. He  has always been on the skirmish line of civilization. Restless,  fearless, chivalric, elemental, he lived hard, shot quick and true,  and died with his face to his foe. Still much misunderstood, he is  often slandered, nearly always caricatured, both by the press and by  the stage. Perhaps these songs, coming direct from the cowboy's  experience, giving vent to his careless and his tender emotions, will  afford future generations a truer conception of what he really was  than is now possessed by those who know him only through highly  colored romances.    The big ranches of the West are now being cut up into small farms. The  nester has come, and come to stay. Gone is the buffalo, the Indian  warwhoop, the free grass of the open plain;--even the stinging lizard,  the horned frog, the centipede, the prairie dog, the rattlesnake, are  fast disappearing. Save in some of the secluded valleys of southern  New Mexico, the old-time round-up is no more; the trails to Kansas and  to Montana have become grass-grown or lost in fields of waving grain;  the maverick steer, the regal longhorn, has been supplanted by his  unpoetic but more beefy and profitable Polled Angus, Durham, and  Hereford cousins from across the seas. The changing and romantic  West of the early days lives mainly in story and in song. The last  figure to vanish is the cowboy, the animating spirit of the vanishing  era. He sits his horse easily as he rides through a wide valley,  enclosed by mountains, clad in the hazy purple of coming night,--with  his face turned steadily down the long, long road, \"the road that the  sun goes down.\" Dauntless, reckless, without the unearthly purity of  Sir Galahad though as gentle to a pure woman as King Arthur, he is  truly a knight of the twentieth century. A vagrant puff of wind shakes  a corner of the crimson handkerchief knotted loosely at his throat;  the thud of his pony's feet mingling with the jingle of his spurs is  borne back; and as the careless, gracious, lovable figure disappears  over the divide, the breeze brings to the ears, faint and far yet  cheery still, the refrain of a cowboy song:      Whoopee ti yi, git along, little dogies;      It's my misfortune and none of your own.    Whoopee ti yi, git along, little dogies;      For you know Wyoming will be your new home.    As for the songs of this collection, I have violated the ethics of  ballad-gatherers, in a few instances, by selecting and putting together  what seemed to be the best lines from different versions, all telling  the same story. Frankly, the volume is meant to be popular. The songs  have been arranged in some such haphazard way as they were  collected,--jotted down on a table in the rear of saloons, scrawled on  an envelope while squatting about a campfire, caught behind the scenes  of a broncho-busting outfit. Later, it is hoped that enough interest  will be aroused to justify printing all the variants of these songs,  accompanied by the music and such explanatory notes as may be useful;  the negro folk-songs, the songs of the lumber jacks, the songs of the  mountaineers, and the songs of the sea, already partially collected,  being included in the final publication. The songs of this collection,  never before in print, as a rule have been taken down from oral  recitation. In only a few instances have I been able to discover the  authorship of any song. They seem to have sprung up as quietly and  mysteriously as does the grass on the plains. All have been popular  with the range riders, several being current all the way from Texas to  Montana, and quite as long as the old Chisholm Trail stretching between  these states. Some of the songs the cowboy certainly composed; all of  them he sang. Obviously, a number of the most characteristic cannot be  printed for general circulation. To paraphrase slightly what Sidney  Lanier said of Walt Whitman's poetry, they are raw collops slashed  from the rump of Nature, and never mind the gristle. Likewise some of  the strong adjectives and nouns have been softened,--Jonahed, as  George Meredith would have said. There is, however, a Homeric  quality about the cowboy's profanity and vulgarity that pleases rather  than repulses. The broad sky under which he slept, the limitless  plains over which he rode, the big, open, free life he lived near to  Nature's breast, taught him simplicity, calm, directness. He spoke out  plainly the impulses of his heart. But as yet so-called polite society  is not quite willing to hear.    It is entirely impossible to acknowledge the assistance I have  received from many persons. To Professors Barrett Wendell and G.L.  Kittredge, of Harvard, I must gratefully acknowledge constant and  generous encouragement. Messrs. Jeff Hanna, of Meridian, Texas; John  B. Jones, a student of the Agricultural and Mechanical College of  Texas; H. Knight, Sterling City, Texas; John Lang Sinclair, San  Antonio; A.H. Belo & Co., Dallas; Tom Hight, of Mangum, Oklahoma; R.  Bedichek, of Deming, N.M.; Benjamin Wyche, Librarian of the Carnegie  Library, San Antonio; Mrs. M.B. Wight, of Ft. Thomas, Arizona; Dr.  L.W. Payne, Jr., and Dr. Morgan Callaway, Jr., of the University of  Texas; and my brother, R.C. Lomax, Austin;--have rendered me  especially helpful service in furnishing material, for which I also  render grateful thanks.    Among the negroes, rivermen, miners, soldiers, seamen, lumbermen,  railroad men, and ranchmen of the United States and Canada there are  many indigenous folk-songs not included in this volume. Of some  of them I have traces, and I shall surely run them down. I beg  the co-operation of all who are interested in this vital,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2131"],[0,"An Account of Egypt (#3)"],[1,"for them  to live in, why did they waste their labour to prove that they had come  into being before all other men? They needed not to have made trial of  the children to see what language they would first utter. However I am  not of the opinion that the Egyptians came into being at the same time  as that which is called by the Ionians the Delta, but that they existed  always ever since the human race came into being, and that as their land  advanced forwards, many of them were left in their first abodes and many  came down gradually to the lower parts. At least it is certain that in  old times Thebes had the name of Egypt, and of this the circumference  measures six thousand one hundred and twenty furlongs.    If then we judge aright of these matters, the opinion of the Ionians  about Egypt is not sound: but if the judgment of the Ionians is right, I  declare that neither the Hellenes nor the Ionians themselves know how  to reckon since they say that the whole earth is made up of three  divisions, Europe, Asia, and Libya: for they ought to count in addition  to these the Delta of Egypt, since it belongs neither to Asia nor to  Libya; for at least it cannot be the river Nile by this reckoning which  divides Asia from Libya, but the Nile is cleft at the point of this  Delta so as to flow round it, and the result is that this land would  come between Asia and Libya.    We dismiss then our opinion of the Ionians, and express a judgment  of our own on this matter also, that Egypt is all that land which is  inhabited by Egyptians, just as Kilikia is that which is inhabited by  Kilikians and Assyria that which is inhabited by Assyrians, and we  know of no boundary properly speaking between Asia and Libya except  the borders of Egypt. If however we shall adopt the opinion which is  commonly held by the Hellenes, we shall suppose that the whole of Egypt,  beginning from the Cataract and the city of Elephantine, is divided into  two parts and that it thus partakes of both the names, since one side  will thus belong to Libya and the other to Asia; for the Nile from the  Cataract onwards flows to the sea cutting Egypt through in the midst;  and as far as the city of Kercasoros the Nile flows in one single  stream, but from this city onwards it is parted into three ways; and  one, which is called the Pelusian mouth, turns towards the East; the  second of the ways goes towards the West, and this is called the Canobic  mouth; but that one of the ways which is straight runs thus,--when the  river in its course downwards comes to the point of the Delta, then it  cuts the Delta through the midst and so issues out to the sea. In this  we have a portion of the water of the river which is not the smallest  nor the least famous, and it is called the Sebennytic mouth. There are  also two other mouths which part off from the Sebennytic and go to  the sea, and these are called, one the Saitic, the other the Mendesian  mouth. The Bolbitinitic, and Bucolic mouths, on the other hand, are  not natural but made by digging. Moreover also the answer given by the  Oracle of Ammon bears witness in support of my opinion that Egypt is of  the extent which I declare it to be in my account; and of this answer  I heard after I had formed my own opinion about Egypt. For those of the  city of Marea and of Apis, dwelling in the parts of Egypt which border  on Libya, being of opinion themselves that they were Libyans and not  Egyptians, and also being burdened by the rules of religious service,  because they desired not to be debarred from the use of cows' flesh,  sent to Ammon saying that they had nought in common with the Egyptians,  for they dwelt outside the Delta and agreed with them in nothing;  and they said they desired that it might be lawful for them to eat  everything without distinction. The god however did not permit them to  do so, but said that that land was Egypt where the Nile came over and  watered, and that those were Egyptians who dwelling below the city of  Elephantine drank of that river. Thus was it answered to them by the  Oracle about this: and the Nile, when it is in flood, goes over not only  the Delta but also of the land which is called Libyan and of that which  is called Arabian sometimes as much as two days' journey on each side,  and at times even more than this or at times less.    As regards the nature of the river, neither from the priests nor  yet from any other man was I able to obtain any knowledge: and I was  desirous especially to learn from them about these matters, namely  why the Nile comes down increasing in volume from the summer solstice  onwards for a hundred days, and then, when it has reached the number of  these days, turns and goes back, failing in its stream, so that through  the whole winter season it continues to be low, and until the summer  solstice returns. Of none of these things was I able to receive any  account from the Egyptians, when I inquired of them what power the Nile  has whereby it is of a nature opposite to that of all other rivers. And  I made inquiry, desiring to know both this which I say and also why,  unlike all other rivers, it does not give rise to any breezes blowing  from it. However some of the Hellenes who desired to gain distinction  for cleverness have given an account of this water in three different  ways: two of these I do not think it worth while even to speak of except  only to indicate their nature; of which the one says that the Etesian  Winds are the cause that makes the river rise, by preventing the Nile  from flowing out into the sea. But often the Etesian Winds fail and yet  the Nile does the same work as it is wont to do; and moreover, if these  were the cause, all the other rivers also which flow in a direction  opposed to the Etesian Winds ought to have been affected in the same way  as the Nile, and even more, in as much as they are smaller and present  to them a feebler flow of streams: but there are many of these rivers in  Syria and many also in Libya, and they are affected in no such manner as  the Nile. The second way shows more ignorance than that which has been  mentioned, and it is more marvellous to tell; for it says that the river  produces these effects because it flows from the Ocean, and that the  Ocean flows round the whole earth. The third of the ways is much the  most specious, but nevertheless it is the most mistaken of all: for  indeed this way has no more truth in it than the rest, alleging as it  does that the Nile flows from melting snow; whereas it flows out of  Libya through the midst of the Ethiopians, and so comes out into Egypt.  How then should it flow from snow, when it flows from the hottest parts  to those which are cooler? And indeed most of the facts are such as  to convince a man (one at least who is capable of reasoning about such  matters), that it is not at all likely that it flows from snow. The  first and greatest evidence is afforded by the winds, which blow hot  from these regions; the second is that the land is rainless always and  without frost, whereas after snow has fallen rain must necessarily come  within five days, so that if it snowed in those parts rain would fall  there; the third evidence is afforded by the people dwelling there, who  are of a black colour by reason of the burning heat. Moreover kites and  swallows remain there through the year and do not leave the land; and  cranes flying from the cold weather which comes on in the region of  Scythia come regularly to these parts for wintering: if then it snowed  ever so little in that land through which the Nile flows and in which  it has its rise, none of these things would take place, as necessity  compels us to admit. As for him who talked about the Ocean, he carried  his tale into the region of the unknown, and so he need not be refuted;  since I for my part know of no river Ocean existing, but I think that  Homer or one of the poets who were before him invented the name and  introduced it into his verse.    If however after I have found fault with the opinions proposed, I am  bound to declare an opinion of my own about the matters which are in  doubt, I will tell what to my mind is the reason why the Nile increases  in the summer. In the winter season the Sun, being driven away from his  former path through the heaven by the stormy winds, comes to the upper  parts of Libya. If one would set forth the matter in the shortest way,  all has now been said; for whatever region this god approaches most and  stands directly above, this it may reasonably be supposed is most in  want of water, and its native streams of rivers are dried up most.  However, to set it forth at greater length, thus it is:--the Sun passing  in his course by the upper parts of Libya, does thus, that is to say,  since at all times the air in those parts is clear and the country is  warm, because there are no cold winds, in passing through it the Sun  does just as he was wont to do in the summer, when going through the  midst of the heaven, that is he draws to himself the water, and having  drawn it he drives it away to the upper parts of the country, and the  winds take it up and scattering it abroad melt it into rain; so it is  natural that the winds which blow from this region, namely the South  and South-west Winds, should be much the most rainy of all the winds. I  think however that the Sun does not send away from himself all the water  of the Nile of each year, but that also he lets some remain behind with  himself. Then when the winter becomes milder, the Sun returns back again  to the midst of the heaven, and from that time onwards he draws equally  from all rivers; but in the meantime they flow in large volume, since  water of rain mingles with them in great quantity, because their country  receives rain then and is filled with torrent streams. In summer however  they are weak, since not only the showers of rain fail them, but also  they are drawn by the Sun. The"]]]
