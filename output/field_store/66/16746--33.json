Iuli Caesaris De Bello Gallico (#3)"],[1,"Caesarem complexus obsecrare coepit ne  quid gravius in fratrem statueret: scire se illa esse vera, nec quemquam  ex eo plus quam se doloris capere, propterea quod, cum ipse gratia  plurimum domi atque in reliqua Gallia, ille minimum propter adulescentiam  posset, per se crevisset; quibus opibus ac nervis non solum ad minuendam  gratiam, sed paene ad perniciem suam uteretur. Sese tamen et amore  fraterno et existimatione vulgi commoveri. Quod si quid ei a Caesare  gravius accidisset, cum ipse eum locum amicitiae apud eum teneret, neminem  existimaturum non sua voluntate factum; qua ex re futurum uti totius  Galliae animi a se averterentur. Haec cum pluribus verbis flens a Caesare  peteret, Caesar eius dextram prendit; consolatus rogat finem orandi  faciat; tanti eius apud se gratiam esse ostendit uti et rei publicae  iniuriam et suum dolorem eius voluntati ac precibus condonet. Dumnorigem  ad se vocat, fratrem adhibet; quae in eo reprehendat ostendit; quae ipse  intellegat, quae civitas queratur proponit; monet ut in reliquum tempus  omnes suspiciones vitet; praeterita se Diviciaco fratri condonare dicit.    Dumnorigi custodes ponit, ut quae agat, quibuscum loquatur scire possit.      Eodem die ab exploratoribus certior factus hostes sub monte consedisse  milia passuum ab ipsius castris octo, qualis esset natura montis et qualis  in circuitu ascensus qui cognoscerent misit.Renuntiatum est facilem esse.    De tertia vigilia T. Labienum, legatum pro praetore, cum duabus legionibus  et iis ducibus qui iter cognoverant summum iugum montis ascendere iubet;  quid sui consilii sit ostendit. Ipse de quarta vigilia eodem itinere quo  hostes ierant ad eos contendit equitatumque omnem ante se mittit.    P. Considius, qui rei militaris peritissimus habebatur et in exercitu  L. Sullae et postea in M. Crassi fuerat, cum exploratoribus praemittitur.      Prima luce, cum summus mons a [Lucio] Labieno teneretur, ipse ab  hostium castris non longius mille et quingentis passibus abesset neque, ut  postea ex captivis comperit, aut ipsius adventus aut Labieni cognitus  esset, Considius equo admisso ad eum accurrit, dicit montem, quem a  Labieno occupari voluerit, ab hostibus teneri: id se a Gallicis armis  atque insignibus cognovisse. Caesar suas copias in proximum collem  subducit, aciem instruit. Labienus, ut erat ei praeceptum a Caesare ne  proelium committeret, nisi ipsius copiae prope hostium castra visae  essent, ut undique uno tempore in hostes impetus fieret, monte occupato  nostros expectabat proelioque abstinebat. Multo denique die per  exploratores Caesar cognovit et montem a suis teneri et Helvetios castra,  movisse et Considium timore perterritum quod non vidisset pro viso sibi  renuntiavisse. Eo die quo consuerat intervallo hostes sequitur et milia  passuum tria ab eorum castris castra ponit.      Postridie eius diei, quod omnino biduum supererat, cum exercitui  frumentum metiri oporteret, et quod a Bibracte, oppido Haeduorum longe  maximo et copiosissimo, non amplius milibus passuum XVIII aberat, rei  frumentariae prospiciendum existimavit; [itaque] iter ab Helvetiis avertit  ac Bibracte ire contendit. Ea res per fugitivos L. Aemilii, decurionis  equitum Gallorum, hostibus nuntiatur. Helvetii, seu quod timore  perterritos Romanos discedere a se existimarent, eo magis quod pridie  superioribus locis occupatis proelium non commisissent, sive eo quod re  frumentaria intercludi posse confiderent, commutato consilio atque itinere  converso nostros a novissimo agmine insequi ac lacessere coeperunt.      Postquam id animum advertit, copias suas Caesar in proximum collem  subduxit equitatumque, qui sustineret hostium petum, misit. Ipse interim  in colle medio triplicem aciem instruxit legionum quattuor veteranarum; in  summo iugo duas legiones quas in Gallia citeriore proxime conscripserat et  omnia auxilia conlocavit, ita ut supra se totum montem hominibus  compleret; impedimenta sarcinasque in unum locum conterri et eum ab iis  qui in superiore acie constiterant muniri iussit. Helvetii cum omnibus  suis carris secuti impedimenta in unum locum contulerunt; ipsi  concertissima acie, reiecto nostro equitatu, phalange facta sub primam  nostram aciem successerunt.      Caesar primum suo, deinde omnium ex conspectu remotis equis, ut  aequato omnium periculo spem fugae tolleret, cohortatus suos proelium  commisit. Milites loco superiore pilis missis facile hostium phalangem  perfregerunt. Ea disiecta gladiis destrictis in eos impetum fecerunt.    Gallis magno ad pugnam erat impedimento quod pluribus eorum scutis uno  ictu pilorum transfixis et conligatis, cum ferrum se inflexisset, neque  evellere neque sinistra impedita satis commode pugnare poterant, multi ut  diu iactato bracchio praeoptarent scutum manu emittere et nudo corpore  pugnare. Tandem vulneribus defessi et pedem referre et, quod mons suberit  circiter mille passuum [spatio], eo se recipere coeperunt. Capto monte et  succedentibus nostris, Boi et Tulingi, qui hominum milibus circiter XV  agmen hostium claudebant et novissimis praesidio erant, ex itinere nostros  [ab] latere aperto adgressi circumvenire, et id conspicati Helvetii, qui  in montem sese receperant, rursus instare et proelium redintegrare  coeperunt. Romani [conversa] signa bipertito intulerunt: prima et  secunda acies, ut victis ac submotis resisteret, tertia, ut venientes  sustineret.      Ita ancipiti proelio diu atque acriter pugnatum est. Diutius cum  sustinere nostrorum impetus non possent, alteri se, ut coeperant, in  montem receperunt, alteri ad impedimenta et carros suos se contulerunt.    Nam hoc toto proelio, cum ab hora septima ad vesperum pugnatum sit,  aversum hostem videre nemo potuit. Ad multam noctem etiam ad impedimenta  pugnatum est, propterea quod pro vallo carros obiecerunt et e loco  superiore in nostros venientes tela coiciebant et non nulli inter carros  rotasque mataras ac tragulas subiciebant nostrosque vulnerabant. Diu cum  esset pugnatum, impedimentis castrisque nostri potiti sunt. Ibi  Orgetorigis filia atque unus e filiis captus est. Ex eo proelio circiter  hominum milia CXXX superfuerunt eaque tota nocte continenter ierunt  [nullam partem noctis itinere intermisso]; in fines Lingonum die quarto  pervenerunt, cum et propter vulnera militum et propter sepulturam  occisorum nostri [triduum morati] eos sequi non potuissent. Caesar ad  Lingonas litteras nuntiosque misit, ne eos frumento neve alia re iuvarent:  qui si iuvissent, se eodem loco quo Helvetios habiturum. Ipse triduo  intermisso cum omnibus copiis eos sequi coepit.      Helvetii omnium rerum inopia adducti legatos de deditione ad eum  miserunt. Qui cum eum in itinere convenissent seque ad pedes proiecissent  suppliciterque locuti flentes pacem petissent, atque eos in eo loco quo  tum essent suum adventum expectare iussisset, paruerunt. Eo postquam  Caesar pervenit, obsides, arma, servos qui ad eos perfugissent, poposcit.    Dum ea conquiruntur et conferuntur, [nocte intermissa] circiter hominum  milia VI eius pagi qui Verbigenus appellatur, sive timore perterriti, ne  armis traditis supplicio adficerentur, sive spe salutis inducti, quod in  tanta multitudine dediticiorum suam fugam aut occultari aut omnino  ignorari posse existimarent, prima nocte e castris Helvetiorum egressi ad  Rhenum finesque Germanorum contenderunt.      Quod ubi Caesar resciit, quorum per fines ierant his uti conquirerent  et reducerent, si sibi purgati esse vellent, imperavit; reductos in  hostium numero habuit; reliquos omnes obsidibus, armis, perfugis traditis  in deditionem accepit. Helvetios, Tulingos, Latobrigos in fines suos,  unde erant profecti, reverti iussit, et, quod omnibus frugibus amissis  domi nihil erat quo famem tolerarent, Allobrogibus imperavit ut iis  frumenti copiam facerent; ipsos oppida vicosque, quos incenderant,  restituere iussit. Id ea maxime ratione fecit, quod noluit eum locum unde  Helvetii discesserant vacare, ne propter bonitatem agrorum Germani, qui  trans Rhenum incolunt, [ex] suis finibus in Helvetiorum fines transirent  et finitimi Galliae provinciae Allobrogibusque essent. Boios petentibus  Haeduis, quod egregia virtute erant cogniti, ut in finibus suis  conlocarent, concessit; quibus illi agros dederunt quosque postea in parem  iuris libertatisque condicionem atque ipsi erant receperunt.      In castris Hevetiorum tabulae repertae sunt litteris Graecis confectae  et ad Caesarem relatae, quibus in tabulis nominatim ratio confecta erat,  qui numerus domo exisset eorum qui arma ferre possent, et item separatim,  [quot] pueri, senes mulieresque. [Quarum omnium rerum] summa erat capitum  Helvetiorum milium CCLXIII, Tulingorum milium XXXVI, Latobrigorum XIIII,  Rauracorum XXIII, Boiorum XXXII; ex his qui arma ferre possent ad milia  nonaginta duo. Summa omnium fuerunt ad milia CCCLXVIII. Eorum qui domum  redierunt censu habito, ut Caesar imperaverat, repertus est numerus milium  C et X.      Bello Helvetiorum confecto totius fere Galliae legati, principes  civitatum, ad Caesarem gratulatum convenerunt: intellegere sese, tametsi  pro veteribus Helvetiorum iniuriis populi Romani ab his poenas bello  repetisset, tamen eam rem non minus ex usu [terrae] Galliae quam populi  Romani accidisse, propterea quod eo consilio florentissimis rebus domos  suas Helvetii reliquissent uti toti Galliae bellum inferrent imperioque  potirentur, locumque domicilio ex magna copia deligerent quem ex omni  Gallia oportunissimum ac fructuosissimum iudicassent, reliquasque  civitates stipendiarias haberent. Petierunt uti sibi concilium totius  Galliae in diem certam indicere idque Caesaris facere voluntate liceret:    sese habere quasdam res quas ex communi consensu ab eo petere vellent. Ea  re permissa diem concilio constituerunt et iure iurando ne quis  enuntiaret, nisi quibus communi consilio mandatum esset, inter se  sanxerunt.      Eo concilio dimisso, idem princeps civitatum qui ante fuerant ad  Caesarem reverterunt petieruntque"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21823"],[0,"The Butterfly's Ball and the Grasshopper's Feast (#3)"],[1,"to  be smart about it, for I've been run down half-a-dozen times already by  the dancers since the sun set.  One lamp is too little for our  ball-room.  That blind Mole has run--ha! there he comes again.  Look  out!\"    As he spoke, the Mole came bearing down towards them in a furious  Portuguese waltz, with a horrified Dragonfly struggling in his arms.    The Grasshopper made a bound to get out of the way, but at that moment  the lively young Cricket laid hold of his leg and held him fast.  The  consequence was that the Mole tumbled over him, fell on the top of the  bloated Spider, and hit his head so violently on the breast of the  Bull-frog that he stopped his noise immediately.    This sudden stoppage of the bass brought the other musicians to a stand,  and as a matter of course stopped the dancing abruptly--with the  exception of a deaf Squirrel, who had failed to find a partner, and who  went on revolving slowly by himself as if nothing had happened.    \"Dear me,\" exclaimed everybody (except the Squirrel), \"what has  happened?\"    \"Oh, nothing worth mentioning,\" said the Grasshopper, getting up with a  limp.  \"You young rascal, what--why--there, take _that_.\"    \"Oh!\" sobbed the young Cricket, pointing with a look of surprise at the  Spider; \"what a sight!\"    He might well say so, for the bloated old Spider had been flattened out  by the weight of the Mole to nearly twice her size, and was apparently  quite dead.  In great concern, the host and hostess ran to raise her.    \"Are you hurt, dear?\" asked the Butterfly, anxiously.    \"Hurt!\" exclaimed the Grasshopper, pushing her aside; \"don't you see  she's burst!\"    \"Oh me!  I'm _so_ sorry,\" exclaimed the Mole, wringing his fore-paws.    At that moment there was a shout of eager expectation, for the Spider  was seen to move.  The Butterfly knelt at her side, and bending down,  said tenderly--    \"Tell me, dear, _has_ he burst you?\"    \"N-no, n-not--qu-quite,\" answered the Spider faintly; \"I'm only  f-flattened.  Let some of you sq-squeeze m-my sides.\"    Immediately a dozen of the young Crickets surrounded the old lady, and  pressed her sides with all their might.  This had the effect of raising  her back a little, and enabling her to draw a good long breath, which  speedily raised her up to her original size.    \"There, I'm all right now,\" she said in a cheerful voice; \"I'm used to  accidents of that sort, and they never leave any bad effects beyond a  little stiffness of the lungs.  Come, Grasshopper, I'll finish that  story.  Get on with your dancing, good people.\"    \"Nobody inquires after _me_,\" croaked the Bull-frog, rubbing his chest.  \"I had no idea a Mole's head was so hard.\"    \"Have some mountain-dew,\" said the Butterfly, gracefully handing him a  blue-bell filled with the precious liquid.  \"It has been gathered on the  Scottish hills by a native Bee, who has just arrived laden with  heather-honey.\"    The Bull-frog accepted the goblet, and drained it to the bottom.    \"It is strong,\" he said, coughing and smacking his lips.    \"Oo ay,\" observed the Scotch Bee; \"it's got the credit o' bein' a wee  thing nippy.\"    Under the influence of the dew the Bull-frog began to sing bass lustily.  The other musicians chimed in.  The dancers seized each other by waist  and hand--or by tail and wing those that happened to have no waists or  hands--and the ball was about to go on, when the Grasshopper shouted--    \"Stop!\"    \"Your money or your life!\" added the lively young Cricket.    \"Silence, pert monkey!--Let us wait a few moments, my friends, for here  come our lamps.\"    As she spoke, a soft light was seen in the far distance gleaming upon  the stems of the trees and steadily advancing.    \"Your relations, Mr Glow-worm, I presume,\" said the Butterfly in a  sweet silvery voice.  \"It is so _very_ kind of you to send for them, and  _so_ obliging in them to come.  Really I cannot find words to express my  gratitude.\"    The countenance of the Glow-worm lighted up with pleasure at these  words.    As the new-comers drew near, they appeared like a great galaxy of minute  stars--as if a mass of the Milky-way had been cut off and hurled down to  earth.  There were several hundreds of them.  As they approached, the  whole forest lighted up; and when at last they descended upon the scene  of the ball, and ranged themselves in a circle round the gay party, it  seemed as if the sun himself had risen again to give them light--only  the radiance was softer and more mysteriously tender than that of the  sun!    Strong light has always an enlivening effect on creatures, whether human  or otherwise.  It cheered up the guests of Mrs Butterfly so much that  they gave vent to an irresistible cheer; called for the music; and went  on to dancing with more zest and energy than ever, insomuch that the  attendant Glow-worms smiled to each other and nodded their heads.    Now it happened that every time the Glow-worms smiled their light  increased.  The lively young Cricket observed this, and began to wonder  whether their light would increase still more if they were to laugh.    \"I'll try to find out,\" said he, going up to a small Glow-worm--  apparently a young one--and requesting her to step aside with him for a  moment.    The little Glow-worm immediately became grave--in other words, dim--and  went with him a little way into the woods.    \"Now,\" said the lively young Cricket, stopping, \"can you laugh?\"    \"What?\" said the little Glow-worm smiling, and, of course, lighting up.    \"Yes, that's it, smile away; but do it harder.  I want you to laugh  outright.  Can't you _laugh_?\"    \"Oh yes, when there is anything to laugh at.\"    \"Well, do it now.\"    \"But I can't, please.\"    \"No; then I'll make you.\"    So saying, the young Cricket seized the little Glow-worm round the waist  and tickled her.    Of course she laughed at first, and, to the Cricket's delight, her face  became wonderfully bright for a moment; but suddenly it became dim, for  he hurt her, and she began to cry.    \"You rascal!\" exclaimed an angry voice, as the Grasshopper gave the  Cricket a kick that sent him head over heels into the grass; \"I felt  sure you were after mischief, and I was right.\"    \"Oh, _please_, don't kick him,\" pleaded the little Glow-worm.  \"He  didn't mean to hurt me.\"    \"No matter.  Get up, sir, and beg her pardon.\"    The young Cricket got up at once and did what he was bid, for he really  did not mean mischief, and was sorry he had hurt her; and little Miss  Glow-worm rewarded him with a smile so radiant that it illuminated the  spot where they stood quite brilliantly, and sparkled through her tears  with rainbow hues.    \"Now I would laugh to please you if I could,\" said Miss Glow-worm, again  smiling.    \"Oh, never mind, my dear.  I'll make you and all your kindred laugh  before the ball is over,\" said the lively young Cricket, hurrying away,  and going straight up to the Scotch Bee, who was clad in a tartan plaid  and kilt.    \"Bee,\" said the Cricket, \"can you dance the Highland Fling?\"    \"Ay, she can do that.\"    \"I could show you a better fling than the Highland one,\" said the  Cricket.    \"Ho! could ye? ye must be verra cliver.  Wull ye let her see't?\"    \"Yes, if you'll dance the Highland fling first?  Will you do it if Mrs  Butterfly asks you?\"    The Scotch Bee good-naturedly agreed.  Of course, the Cricket had no  difficulty in persuading the hostess to ask him.  The musicians could  not play a reel; but this mattered not, for the Bee could hum to  himself.  Great was the delight and surprise of the company when they  beheld the Scotch Bee twirling his legs, snapping his fingers, and  humming the reel of Tulloch, while the tartans fluttered round him like  shreds of a shattered rainbow.    The dance waxed more and more furious, and the plaudits of the company  grew louder, when, suddenly, the lively young Cricket ran in between the  Bee's legs, tripped him up, and sent him sprawling on the grass.  A wild  shout of laughter burst from the company--Glow-worms included--and the  ball-room brightened up for a few moments as if it had been set on fire!    \"That's the fling I spoke of,\" cried the Cricket, leaping up and running  away.    The Scotch Bee sprang up, drew his dirk, and gave chase, but Mr  Grasshopper caught him by the arm and dragged him off.    \"Ho! friends--supper--supper!  This way.  Don't sheathe your dirk.  I  have a haggis ready for you to sheathe it in.  Come along; give your arm  to that bloated old Spider there.  She'll keep you in spirits.\"    The Bee was mollified.  He gave his arm to the Spider; then all the  company went off to sup in a neighbouring glade.  Shall we describe the  supper?  We think not.  It was beyond description delightful.  Just as  it was finished the moon rose from behind a cloud, so the company knew  that it was time to go home.    Before going away, they all assembled at the foot of the oak, and shook  claws with Lady Butterfly and Mr Grasshopper, saying that they were  charmed with the delightful evening they had spent, and that they hoped  to be soon invited again.    In a few minutes they were all gone.  The sounds of their laughing  voices, as they returned home, died gradually away, and the shadows of  night spread over the quiet forest and the happy little creatures that  slumbered there."]]]
