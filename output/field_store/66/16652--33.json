At the same time the court of Rome, sobered in some measure,  by the perilous crisis that confronted it, from its long orgy of simony,  nepotism, and sensuality, began to find time and thought for spiritual  duties. The establishment of the \"congregations\" or administrative  boards, and especially of the _Congregatio de Propaganda Fide_, or board  of missions, dates chiefly from the sixteenth century. The revived  interest in theological study incident to the general spiritual  quickening gave the church, as the result of the labors of the Council  of Trent, a well-defined body of doctrine, which nevertheless was not so  narrowly defined as to preclude differences and debates among the  diverse sects of the clergy, by whose competitions and antagonisms the  progress of missions both in Christian and in heathen lands was destined  to be so seriously affected.    An incident of the Catholic Reformation of the sixteenth  century--inevitable incident, doubtless, in that age, but none the less  deplorable--was the engendering or intensifying of that cruel and  ferocious form of fanaticism which is defined as the combination of  religious emotion with the malignant passions. The tendency to  fanaticism is one of the perils attendant on the deep stirring of  religious feeling at any time; it was especially attendant on the  religious agitations of that period; but most of all it was in Spain,  where, of all the Catholic nations, corruption had gone deepest and  spiritual revival was most earnest and sincere, that the manifestations  of fanaticism were most shocking. Ferdinand and Isabella the Catholic  were distinguished alike by their piety and their part in the promotion  of civilization, and by the horrors of bloody cruelty perpetrated by  their authority and that of the church, at the instigation of the  sincere and devout reformer Ximenes. In the memorable year 1492 was  inaugurated the fiercest work of the Spanish Inquisition, concerning  which, speaking of her own part in it, the pious Isabella was able  afterward to say, \"For the love of Christ and of his virgin mother I  have caused great misery, and have depopulated towns and districts,  provinces and kingdoms.\"    The earlier pages of American church history will not be intelligently  read unless it is well understood that the Christianity first to be  transplanted to the soil of the New World was the Christianity of  Spain--the Spain of Isabella and Ximenes, of Loyola and Francis Xavier  and St. Theresa, the Spain also of Torquemada and St. Peter Arbues and  the zealous and orthodox Duke of Alva.      FOOTNOTES:    [2:1] See the account of the Greenland church and its missions in  Professor O'Gorman's \"History of the Roman Catholic Church in the United  States\" (vol. ix. of the American Church History Series), pp. 3-12.          CHAPTER II.    SPANISH CONQUEST--THE PROPAGATION, DECAY, AND DOWNFALL OF SPANISH  CHRISTIANITY.      It is a striking fact that the earliest monuments of colonial and  ecclesiastical antiquity within the present domain of the United States,  after the early Spanish remains in Florida, are to be found in those  remotely interior and inaccessible highlands of New Mexico, which have  only now begun to be reached in the westward progress of migration.  Before the beginnings of permanent English colonization at Plymouth and  at Jamestown, before the French beginnings on the St. Lawrence, before  the close of the sixteenth century, there had been laid by Spanish  soldiers, adventurers, and missionaries, in those far recesses of the  continent, the foundations of Christian towns and churches, the stately  walls and towers of which still invite the admiration of the traveler.    The fact is not more impressive than it is instructive. It illustrates  the prodigious impetuosity of that tide of conquest which within so few  years from the discovery of the American continents not only swept over  the regions of South and Central America and the great plateau of  Mexico, but actually occupied with military posts, with extensive and  successful missions, and with a colonization which seemed to show every  sign of stability and future expansion, by far the greater part of the  present domain of the United States exclusive of Alaska--an  ecclesiastico-military empire stretching its vast diameter from the  southernmost cape of Florida across twenty-five parallels of latitude  and forty-five meridians of longitude to the Strait of Juan de Fuca. The  lessons taught by this amazingly swift extension of the empire and the  church, and its arrest and almost extinction, are legible on the surface  of the history. It is a strange, but not unparalleled, story of  attempted cooeperation in the common service of God and Mammon and  Moloch--of endeavors after concord between Christ and Belial.    There is no reason to question the sincerity with which the rulers of  Spain believed themselves to be actuated by the highest motives of  Christian charity in their terrible and fatal American policy. \"The  conversion of the Indians is the principal foundation of the  conquest--that which ought principally to be attended to.\" So wrote the  king in a correspondence in which a most cold-blooded authorization is  given for the enslaving of the Indians.[7:1] After the very first voyage  of Columbus every expedition of discovery or invasion was equipped with  its contingent of clergy--secular priests as chaplains to the Spaniards,  and friars of the regular orders for mission work among the Indians--at  cost of the royal treasury or as a charge upon the new conquests.    This subsidizing of the church was the least serious of the injuries  inflicted on the cause of the gospel by the piety of the Spanish  government. That such subsidizing is in the long run an injury is a  lesson illustrated not only in this case, but in many parallel cases in  the course of this history. A far more dreadful wrong was the  identifying of the religion of Jesus Christ with a system of war and  slavery, well-nigh the most atrocious in recorded history. For such a  policy the Spanish nation had just received a peculiar training. It is  one of the commonplaces of history to remark that the barbarian invaders  of the Roman empire were themselves vanquished by their own victims,  being converted by them to the Christian faith. In like manner the  Spanish nation, triumphing over its Moslem subjects in the expulsion of  the Moors, seemed in its American conquests to have been converted to  the worst of the tenets of Islam. The propagation of the gospel in the  western hemisphere, under the Spanish rule, illustrated in its public  and official aspects far more the principles of Mohammed than those of  Jesus. The triple alternative offered by the Saracen or the  Turk--conversion or tribute or the sword--was renewed with aggravations  by the Christian conquerors of America. In a form deliberately drawn up  and prescribed by the civil and ecclesiastical counselors at Madrid, the  invader of a new province was to summon the rulers and people to  acknowledge the church and the pope and the king of Spain; and in case  of refusal or delay to comply with this summons, the invader was to  notify them of the consequences in these terms: \"If you refuse, by the  help of God we shall enter with force into your land, and shall make war  against you in all ways and manners that we can, and subject you to the  yoke and obedience of the church and of their Highnesses; we shall take  you and your wives and your children and make slaves of them, and sell  and dispose of them as their Highnesses may command; and we shall take  away your goods, and do you all the mischief and damage that we can, as  to vassals who do not obey and refuse to receive their lord; and we  protest that the deaths and losses that shall accrue from this are your  own fault.\"[8:1]    While the church was thus implicated in crimes against humanity which  history shudders to record, it is a grateful duty to remember that it  was from the church also and in the name of Christ that bold protests  and strenuous efforts were put forth in behalf of the oppressed and  wronged. Such names as Las Casas and Montesinos shine with a beautiful  luster in the darkness of that age; and the Dominican order, identified  on the other side of the sea with the fiercest cruelties of the Spanish  Inquisition, is honorable in American church history for its fearless  championship of liberty and justice.    The first entrance of Spanish Christianity upon the soil of the United  States was wholly characteristic. In quest of the Fountain of Youth,  Ponce de Leon sailed for the coast of Florida equipped with forces both  for the carnal and for the spiritual warfare. Besides his colonists and  his men-at-arms, he brought his secular priests as chaplains and his  monks as missionaries; and his instructions from the crown required him  to summon the natives, as in the famous \"Requerimiento,\" to submit  themselves to the Catholic faith and to the king of Spain, under threat  of the sword and slavery. The invaders found a different temper in the  natives from what was encountered in Mexico and Peru, where the  populations were miserably subjugated, or in the islands, where they  were first enslaved and presently completely exterminated. The insolent  invasion was met, as it deserved, by effective volleys of arrows, and  its chivalrous leader was driven back to Cuba, to die there of his  wounds.

If a man commits a sin, let him not do it again; let him not  delight in sin: pain is the outcome of evil.    118. If a man does what is good, let him do it again; let him delight in  it: happiness is the outcome of good.    119. Even an evil-doer sees happiness as long as his evil deed has not  ripened; but when his evil deed has ripened, then does the evil-doer see  evil.    120. Even a good man sees evil days, as long as his good deed has not  ripened; but when his good deed has ripened, then does the good man see  happy days.    121. Let no man think lightly of evil, saying in his heart, It will not  come nigh unto me. Even by the falling of water-drops a water-pot is  filled; the fool becomes full of evil, even if he gather it little by  little.    122. Let no man think lightly of good, saying in his heart, It will not  come nigh unto me. Even by the falling of water-drops a water-pot is  filled; the wise man becomes full of good, even if he gather it little  by little.    123. Let a man avoid evil deeds, as a merchant, if he has few companions  and carries much wealth, avoids a dangerous road; as a man who loves  life avoids poison.    124. He who has no wound on his hand, may touch poison with his hand;  poison does not affect one who has no wound; nor is there evil for one  who does not commit evil.    125. If a man offend a harmless, pure, and innocent person, the evil  falls back upon that fool, like light dust thrown up against the wind.    126. Some people are born again; evil-doers go to hell; righteous  people go to heaven; those who are free from all worldly desires attain  Nirvana.    127. Not in the sky, not in the midst of the sea, not if we enter into  the clefts of the mountains, is there known a spot in the whole world  where death could not overcome (the mortal).          Chapter X. Punishment    129. All men tremble at punishment, all men fear death; remember that  you are like unto them, and do not kill, nor cause slaughter.    130. All men tremble at punishment, all men love life; remember that  thou art like unto them, and do not kill, nor cause slaughter.    131. He who seeking his own happiness punishes or kills beings who also  long for happiness, will not find happiness after death.    132. He who seeking his own happiness does not punish or kill beings who  also long for happiness, will find happiness after death.    133. Do not speak harshly to anybody; those who are spoken to will  answer thee in the same way. Angry speech is painful, blows for blows  will touch thee.    134. If, like a shattered metal plate (gong), thou utter not, then thou  hast reached Nirvana; contention is not known to thee.    135. As a cowherd with his staff drives his cows into the stable, so do  Age and Death drive the life of men.    136. A fool does not know when he commits his evil deeds: but the wicked  man burns by his own deeds, as if burnt by fire.    137. He who inflicts pain on innocent and harmless persons, will soon  come to one of these ten states:    138. He will have cruel suffering, loss, injury of the body, heavy  affliction, or loss of mind,    139. Or a misfortune coming from the king, or a fearful accusation, or  loss of relations, or destruction of treasures,    140. Or lightning-fire will burn his houses; and when his body is  destroyed, the fool will go to hell.    141. Not nakedness, not platted hair, not dirt, not fasting, or lying on  the earth, not rubbing with dust, not sitting motionless, can purify a  mortal who has not overcome desires.    142. He who, though dressed in fine apparel, exercises tranquillity, is  quiet, subdued, restrained, chaste, and has ceased to find fault with  all other beings, he indeed is a Brahmana, an ascetic (sramana), a friar  (bhikshu).    143. Is there in this world any man so restrained by humility that he  does not mind reproof, as a well-trained horse the whip?    144. Like a well-trained horse when touched by the whip, be ye active  and lively, and by faith, by virtue, by energy, by meditation, by  discernment of the law you will overcome this great pain (of reproof),  perfect in knowledge and in behaviour, and never forgetful.    145. Well-makers lead the water (wherever they like); fletchers bend the  arrow; carpenters bend a log of wood; good people fashion themselves.          Chapter XI. Old Age    146. How is there laughter, how is there joy, as this world is always  burning? Why do you not seek a light, ye who are surrounded by darkness?    147. Look at this dressed-up lump, covered with wounds, joined together,  sickly, full of many thoughts, which has no strength, no hold!    148. This body is wasted, full of sickness, and frail; this heap of  corruption breaks to pieces, life indeed ends in death.    149. Those white bones, like gourds thrown away in the autumn, what  pleasure is there in looking at them?    150. After a stronghold has been made of the bones, it is covered with  flesh and blood, and there dwell in it old age and death, pride and  deceit.    151. The brilliant chariots of kings are destroyed, the body also  approaches destruction, but the virtue of good people never approaches  destruction,--thus do the good say to the good.    152. A man who has learnt little, grows old like an ox; his flesh grows,  but his knowledge does not grow.    153, 154. Looking for the maker of this tabernacle, I shall have to run  through a course of many births, so long as I do not find (him); and  painful is birth again and again. But now, maker of the tabernacle, thou  hast been seen; thou shalt not make up this tabernacle again. All thy  rafters are broken, thy ridge-pole is sundered; the mind, approaching  the Eternal (visankhara, nirvana), has attained to the extinction of all  desires.    155. Men who have not observed proper discipline, and have not gained  treasure in their youth, perish like old herons in a lake without fish.    156. Men who have not observed proper discipline, and have not gained  treasure in their youth, lie, like broken bows, sighing after the past.          Chapter XII. Self    157. If a man hold himself dear, let him watch himself carefully; during  one at least out of the three watches a wise man should be watchful.    158. Let each man direct himself first to what is proper, then let him  teach others; thus a wise man will not suffer.    159. If a man make himself as he teaches others to be, then, being  himself well subdued, he may subdue (others); one's own self is indeed  difficult to subdue.    160. Self is the lord of self, who else could be the lord? With self  well subdued, a man finds a lord such as few can find.    161. The evil done by oneself, self-begotten, self-bred, crushes the  foolish, as a diamond breaks a precious stone.    162. He whose wickedness is very great brings himself down to that state  where his enemy wishes him to be, as a creeper does with the tree which  it surrounds.    163. Bad deeds, and deeds hurtful to ourselves, are easy to do; what is  beneficial and good, that is very difficult to do.    164. The foolish man who scorns the rule of the venerable (Arahat), of  the elect (Ariya), of the virtuous, and follows false doctrine, he bears  fruit to his own destruction, like the fruits of the Katthaka reed.    165. By oneself the evil is done, by oneself one suffers; by oneself  evil is left undone, by oneself one is purified. Purity and impurity  belong to oneself, no one can purify another.    166. Let no one forget his own duty for the sake of another's, however  great; let a man, after he has discerned his own duty, be always  attentive to his duty.          Chapter XIII. The World    167. Do not follow the evil law! Do not live on in thoughtlessness! Do  not follow false doctrine! Be not a friend of the world.    168. Rouse thyself! do not be idle! Follow the law of virtue! The  virtuous rests in bliss in this world and in the next.    169. Follow the law of virtue; do not follow that of sin. The virtuous  rests in bliss in this world and in the next.    170. Look upon the world as a bubble, look upon it as a mirage: the king  of death does not see him who thus looks down upon the world.    171. Come, look at this glittering world, like unto a royal chariot; the  foolish are immersed in it, but the wise do not touch it.    172. He who formerly was reckless and afterwards became sober, brightens  up this world, like the moon when freed from clouds.    173. He whose evil deeds are covered by good deeds, brightens up this  world, like the moon when freed from clouds.    174. This world is dark, few only can see here; a few only go to heaven,  like birds escaped from the net.    175. The swans go on the path of the sun, they go through the ether by  means of their miraculous power; the wise are led out of this world,  when they have conquered Mara and his train.    176. If a man has transgressed one law, and speaks lies, and scoffs at  another world, there is no evil he will not do.    177. The uncharitable do not go to the world of the gods; fools only do  not praise liberality; a wise man rejoices in liberality, and through it  becomes blessed in the other world.    178. Better than sovereignty over the earth, better than going to  heaven, better than lordship over all worlds, is the reward of the first  step in holiness.          Chapter XIV. The Buddha (The Awakened)    179. He whose conquest is not conquered again, into whose conquest no  one in this world enters, by what track can you lead him, the Awakened,  the Omniscient, the trackless?    180. He whom no desire with its snares and poisons can lead astray,  by what track can you lead him, the Awakened, the Omniscient, the  trackless?    181. Even the gods envy those who are awakened and not forgetful, who  are given to meditation, who are wise, and who delight in the repose of  retirement (from the world).    182. Difficult (to obtain) is the conception of men,"]]]
