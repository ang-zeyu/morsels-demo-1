June seems to  be the only month in the year in which the eggs of this species have  not been found. In the United Provinces more nests containing eggs are  discovered in January than in any other month.    Occasionally in January a pair of hoopoes (_Upupa indica_) steals a  march on its brethren by selecting a nesting site and laying eggs.  Hoopoes nest in holes in trees or buildings. The aperture to the nest  cavity is invariably small. The hen hoopoe alone incubates, and as,  when once she has begun to sit, she rarely, if ever, leaves the nest  till the eggs are hatched, the cock has to bring food to her. But, to  describe the nesting operations of the hoopoe in January is like  talking of cricket in April. It is in February and March that the  hoopoes nest in their millions, and call softly, from morn till eve,  _uk-uk-uk_.    Of the other birds which nest later in the season mention must be made  in the calendar for the present month of the Indian cliff-swallow  (_Hirundo fluvicola_) and the blue rock-pigeon (_Columba intermedia_),  because their nests are sometimes seen in January.          FEBRUARY      There's perfume upon every wind,    Music in every tree,    Dews for the moisture-loving flowers,    Sweets for the sucking-bee.                                  N. P. WILLIS.      Even as January in northern India may be compared to a month made up  of English May days and March nights, so may the Indian February be  likened to a halcyon month composed of sparkling, sun-steeped June  days and cool starlit April nights.    February is the most pleasant month of the whole year in both the  Punjab and the United Provinces; even November must yield the palm to  it. The climate is perfect. The nights and early mornings are cool and  invigorating; the remainder of each day is pleasantly warm; the sun's  rays, although gaining strength day by day, do not become  uncomfortably hot save in the extreme south of the United Provinces.  The night mists, so characteristic of December and January, are almost  unknown in February, and the light dews that form during the hours of  darkness disappear shortly after sunrise.    The Indian countryside is now good to look upon; it possesses all the  beauties of the landscape of July; save the sunsets. The soft emerald  hue of the young wheat and barley is rendered more vivid by contrast  with the deep rich green of the mango trees. Into the earth's verdant  carpet is worked a gay pattern of white poppies, purple linseed  blooms, blue and pink gram flowers, and yellow blossoms of mimosa,  mustard and _arhar_. Towards the end of the month the silk-cotton  trees (_Bombax malabarica_) begin to put forth their great red  flowers, but not until March does each look like a great scarlet  nosegay.    The patches of sugar-cane grow smaller day by day, and in nearly every  village the little presses are at work from morn till eve.    From the guava groves issue the rattle of tin pots and the shouts of  the boys told off to protect the ripening fruit from the attacks of  crows, parrots and other feathered marauders. Nor do these sounds  terminate at night-fall; indeed they become louder after dark, for it  is then that the flying-foxes come forth and work sad havoc among  fruit of all descriptions.    The fowls of the air are more vivacious than they were in January. The  bulbuls tinkle more blithely, the purple sunbirds sing more lustily;  the _kutur_, _kutur_, _kuturuk_ of the green barbets is uttered more  vociferously; the nuthatches now put their whole soul into their loud,  sharp _tee-tee-tee-tee_, the hoopoes call _uk-uk-uk_ more vigorously.    The coppersmiths (_Xantholaema haematocephala_) begin to hammer on  their anvils--_tonk-tonk-tonk-tonk_, softly and spasmodically in the  early days of the month, but with greater frequency and intensity as  the days pass. The brain-fever bird (_Hierococcyx varius_) announces  his arrival in the United Provinces by uttering an occasional  \"brain-fever.\" As the month draws to its close his utterances become  more frequent. But his time is not yet. He merely gives us in February  a foretaste of what is to come.    The _tew_ of the black-headed oriole (_Oriolus melanocephalus_), which  is the only note uttered by the bird in the colder months, is  occasionally replaced in February by the summer call of the species--a  liquid, musical _peeho_. In the latter half of the month the Indian  robin (_Thamnobia cambayensis_) begins to find his voice. Although not  the peer of his English cousin, he is no mean singer. At this time of  year, however, his notes are harsh. He is merely \"getting into form.\"    The feeble, but sweet, song of the crested lark or _Chandul_ is one of  the features of February. The Indian skylark likewise may now be heard  singing at Heaven's gate in places where there are large tracts of  uncultivated land. As in January so in February the joyous \"Think of  me ... Never to be\" of the grey-headed flycatcher emanates from every  tope.    By the middle of the month the pied wagtails and pied bush chats are  in full song. Their melodies, though of small volume, are very sweet.    The large grey shrikes add the clamour of their courtship to the avian  chorus.    Large numbers of doves, vultures, eagles, red-headed merlins, martins  and munias--birds whose nests were described in January--are still  busy feeding their young.    The majority of the brown fish-owls (_Ketupa ceylonensis_) and rock  horned-owls (_Bubo bengalensis_) are sitting; a few of them are  feeding young birds. The dusky horned-owls (_B. coromandus_) have  either finished breeding or are tending nestlings. In addition to the  nests of the above-mentioned owls those of the collared scops owl  (_Scops bakkamaena_) and the mottled wood-owl (_Syrnium ocellatum_)  are likely to be found at this season of the year. The scops is a  small owl with aigrettes or \"horns,\" the wood-owl is a large bird  without aigrettes.    Both nest in holes in trees and lay white eggs after the manner of  their kind. The scops owl breeds from January till April, while  February and March are the months in which to look for the eggs of the  wood-owl.    In the western districts of the United Provinces the Indian  cliff-swallows (_Hirundo fluvicola_) are beginning to construct their  curious nests. Here and there a pair of blue rock-pigeons (_Colombia  intermedia_) is busy with eggs or young ones. In the Punjab the ravens  are likewise employed.    The nesting season of the hoopoe has now fairly commenced. Courtship  is the order of the day. The display of this beautiful species is not  at all elaborate. The bird that \"shows off\" merely runs along the  ground with corona fully expanded. Mating hoopoes, however, perform  strange antics in the air; they twist and turn and double, just as a  flycatcher does when chasing a fleet insect. Both the hoopoe and the  roller are veritable aerial acrobats. By the end of the month all but  a few of the hoopoes have begun to nest; most of them have eggs, while  the early birds, described in January as stealing a march on their  brethren, are feeding their offspring. The 6th February is the  earliest date on which the writer has observed a hoopoe carrying food  to the nest; that was at Ghazipur.    March and April are the months in which the majority of coppersmiths  or crimson-breasted barbets rear up their families. Some, however, are  already working at their nests. The eggs are hatched in a cavity in a  tree--a cavity made by means of the bird's bill. Both sexes take part  in nest construction. A neatly-cut circular hole, about the size of a  rupee, on the lower surface or the side of a branch is assuredly the  entrance to the nest of a coppersmith, a green barbet, or a  woodpecker.    As the month draws to its close many a pair of nuthatches (_Sitta  castaneiventris_) may be observed seeking for a hollow in which to  nestle. The site selected is usually a small hole in the trunk of a  mango tree that has weathered many monsoons. The birds reduce the  orifice of the cavity to a very small size by plastering up the  greater part of it with mud. Hence the nest of the nuthatch, unless  discovered when in course of construction, is difficult to locate.    All the cock sunbirds (_Arachnechthra asiatica_) are now in the full  glory of their nuptial plumage. Here and there an energetic little hen  is busily constructing her wonderful pendent nest. Great is the  variety of building material used by the sunbird. Fibres, slender  roots, pliable stems, pieces of decayed wood, lichen, thorns and even  paper, cotton and rags, are pressed into service. All are held  together by cobweb, which is the favourite cement of bird masons. The  general shape of the nest is that of a pear. Its contour is often  irregular, because some of the materials hang loosely from the outer  surface.    The nursery is attached by means of cobweb to the beam or branch from  which it hangs. It is cosily lined with cotton or other soft material.  The hen, who alone builds the nest and incubates the eggs, enters and  leaves the chamber by a hole at one side. This is protected by a  little penthouse. The door serves also as window. The hen rests her  chin on the lower part of this while she is incubating her eggs, and  thus is able, as she sits, to see what is going on in the great world  without. She displays little fear of man and takes no pains to conceal  her nest, which is often built in the verandah of an inhabited  bungalow.    As the month nears its end the big black crows (_Corvus  macrorhynchus_) begin to construct their nests. The site selected is  usually a forked branch of a large tree. The nest is a clumsy platform  of sticks with a slight depression, lined by human or horse hair or  other soft material, for the reception of the eggs. Both sexes take  part in incubation. From the time the first egg is laid until the  young"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1825"],[0,"The Adventures of Reddy Fox (#3)"],[1," down below. Reddy Fox gave one quick  look at the foot of the old tree trunk and saw a gun pointed at him and  behind the gun the freckled face of Farmer Brown's boy. Reddy Fox gave  a little gasp of fright and turned so suddenly that he almost fell flat.  Then he began to run as never in his life had he run before. It seemed  as though his flying feet hardly touched the grass. His eyes were  popping out with fright as with every jump he tried to run just a wee  bit faster.    Bang! Bang! Two flashes of fire and two puffs of smoke darted from  behind the old tree trunk. Drummer the Woodpecker gave a frightened  scream and flew deep into the Green Forest. Peter Rabbit flattened  himself under a friendly bramble bush. Johnny Chuck dived headfirst down  his doorway.    Reddy Fox gave a yelp, a shrill little yelp of pain, and suddenly began  to go lame. But Farmer Brown's boy didn't know that. He thought he had  missed and he growled to himself:    \"I'll get that fox yet for stealing my pet chicken!\"          VIII. Granny Fox Takes Care of Reddy    Reddy Fox was so sore and lame that he could hardly hobble. He had had  the hardest kind of work to get far enough ahead of Bowser the Hound to  mix his trail up so that Bowser couldn't follow it. Then he had limped  home, big tears running down his nose, although he tried hard not to  cry. \"Oh! Oh! Oh!\" moaned Reddy Fox, as he crept in at the doorway of  his home.    \"What's the matter now?\" snapped old Granny Fox, who had just waked up  from a sun nap.    \"I--I've got hurt,\" said Reddy Fox, and began to cry harder. Granny Fox  looked at Reddy sharply. \"What have you been doing now--tearing your  clothes on a barbed-wire fence or trying to crawl through a bull-briar  thicket? I should think you were big enough by this time to look out for  yourself!\" said Granny Fox crossly, as she came over to look at Reddy's  hurts.    \"Please don't scold, please don't, Granny Fox,\" begged Reddy, who was  beginning to feel sick to his stomach as well as lame, and to smart  dreadfully.    Granny Fox took one look at Reddy's wounds, and knew right away what had  happened. She made Reddy stretch himself out at full length and then  she went to work on him, washing his wounds with the greatest care and  binding them up. She was very gentle, was old Granny Fox, as she touched  the sore places, but all the time she was at work her tongue flew, and  that wasn't gentle at all. Oh, my, no! There was nothing gentle about  that!    You see, old Granny Fox is wise and very, very sharp and shrewd. Just as  soon as she saw Reddy's hurts, she knew that they were made by shot  from a gun, and that meant that Reddy Fox had been careless or he never,  never would have been where he was in danger of being shot.    \"I hope this will teach you a lesson!\" said Granny Fox. \"What are your  eyes and your ears and your nose for? To keep you out of just such  trouble as this.    \"A little Fox must use his eyes Or get someday a sad surprise.    \"A little Fox must use his ears And know what makes each sound he hears.    \"A little Fox must use his nose And try the wind where'er he goes.    \"A little Fox must use all three To live to grow as old as me.    \"Now tell me all about it, Reddy Fox. This is summer and men don't  hunt foxes now. I don't see how it happens that Farmer Brown's boy was  waiting for you with a gun.\"    So Reddy Fox told Granny Fox all about how he had run too near the old  tree trunk behind which Farmer Brown's boy had been hiding, but Reddy  didn't tell how he had been trying to show off, or how in broad daylight  he had stolen the pet chicken of Farmer Brown's boy. You may be sure he  was very careful not to mention that.    And so old Granny Fox puckered up her brows and thought and thought,  trying to find some good reason why Farmer Brown's boy should have been  hunting in the summertime.    \"Caw, caw, caw!\" shouted Blacky the Crow.    The face of Granny Fox cleared. \"Blacky the Crow has been stealing, and  Farmer Brown's boy was out after him when Reddy came along,\" said Granny  Fox, talking out loud to herself.    Reddy Fox grew very red in the face, but he never said a word.          IX. Peter Rabbit Hears the News    Johnny Chuck came running up to the edge of the Old Briarpatch quite  out of breath. You see, he is so round and fat and roly-poly that to run  makes him puff and blow. Johnny Chuck's eyes danced with excitement as  he peered into the Old Briar-patch, trying to see Peter Rabbit.    \"Peter! Peter Rabbit! Oh, Peter!\" he called. No one answered. Johnny  Chuck looked disappointed. It was the middle of the morning, and he had  thought that Peter would surely be at home then. He would try once more.  \"Oh, you Peter Rabbit!\" he shouted in such a high-pitched voice that it  was almost a squeal.    \"What you want?\" asked a sleepy voice from the middle of the Old  Briar-patch.    Johnny Chuck's face lighted up. \"Come out here, Peter, where I can look  at you,\" cried Johnny.    \"Go away, Johnny Chuck! I'm sleepy,\" said Peter Rabbit, and his voice  sounded just a wee bit cross, for Peter had been out all night, a habit  which Peter has.    \"I've got some news for you, Peter,\" called Johnny Chuck eagerly.    \"How do you know it's news to me?\" asked Peter, and Johnny noticed that  his voice wasn't quite so cross.    \"I'm almost sure it is, for I've just heard it myself, and I've hurried  right down here to tell you because I think you'll want to know it,\"  replied Johnny Chuck.    \"Pooh!\" said Peter Rabbit, \"it's probably as old as the hills to me.  You folks who go to bed with the sun don't hear the news until it's old.  What is it?\"    \"It's about Reddy Fox,\" began Johnny Chuck, but Peter Rabbit interrupted  him.    \"Shucks, Johnny Chuck! You are slow! Why, it was all over Green Meadows  last night how Reddy Fox had been shot by Farmer Brown's boy!\" jeered  Peter Rabbit. \"That's no news. And here you've waked me up to tell me  something I knew before you went to bed last night! Serves Reddy Fox  right. Hope he'll be lame for a week,\" added Peter Rabbit.    \"He can't walk at all!\" cried Johnny Chuck in triumph, sure now that  Peter Rabbit hadn't heard the news.    \"What's that?\" demanded Peter, and Johnny Chuck could hear him begin  to hop along one of his little private paths in the heart of the Old  Briar-patch. He knew now that Peter Rabbit's curiosity was aroused, and  he smiled to himself.    In a few minutes Peter thrust a sleepy-looking face out from the Old  Briar-patch and grinned rather sheepishly. \"What was that you were  saying about Reddy Fox?\" he asked again.    \"I've a good mind not to tell you, Mr. Know-it-all,\" exclaimed Johnny  Chuck.    \"Oh, please, Johnny Chuck,\" pleaded Peter Rabbit.    Finally Johnny gave in. \"I said that Reddy Fox can't walk. Aren't you  glad, Peter?\"    \"How do you know?\" asked Peter, for Peter is very suspicious of Reddy  Fox, and has to watch out for his tricks all the time.    \"Jimmy Skunk told me. He was up by Reddy's house early this morning and  saw Reddy try to walk. He tried and tried and couldn't. You won't have  to watch out for Reddy Fox for some time, Peter. Serves him right,  doesn't it?''    \"Let's go up and see if it really is true!\" said Peter suddenly.    \"All right,\" said Johnny Chuck, and off they started.          X. Poor Reddy Fox    Peter Rabbit and Johnny Chuck stole up the hill toward the home of Reddy  Fox. As they drew near, they crept from one bunch of grass to another  and from bush to bush, stopping behind each to look and listen. They  were not taking any chances. Johnny Chuck was not much afraid of Reddy  Fox, for he had whipped him once, but he was afraid of old Granny Fox.  Peter Rabbit was afraid of both. The nearer he got to the home of Reddy  Fox, the more anxious and nervous he grew. You see, Reddy Fox had played  so many tricks to try and catch Peter that Peter was not quite sure that  this was not another trick. So he kept a sharp watch in every direction,  ready to run at the least sign of danger.    When they had tiptoed and crawled to a point where they could see the  doorstep of the Fox home, Peter Rabbit and Johnny Chuck lay down in a  clump of bushes and watched. Pretty soon they saw old Granny Fox come  out. She sniffed the wind and then she started off at a quick run down  the Lone Little Path. Johnny Chuck gave a sigh of relief, for he wasn't  afraid of Reddy and now he felt safe. But Peter Rabbit was just as  watchful as ever.    \"I've got to see Reddy for myself before I'll go a step nearer,\" he  whispered. Just then Johnny Chuck put a hand on his lips and pointed  with the other hand. There was Reddy Fox crawling out of his doorway  into the sun. Peter Rabbit leaned forward to see better. Was Reddy Fox  really so badly hurt, or was he only pretending?    Reddy Fox crawled painfully out onto his doorstep. He tried to stand  and walk, but he couldn't because he was too stiff and sore. So he just  crawled. He didn't know that anyone was watching him, and with every  movement he made a face. That was because it hurt so.    Peter Rabbit, watching from the clump of bushes, knew then that Reddy  was not pretending. He knew that he had nothing, not the least little  thing, to fear from Reddy Fox. So Peter gave a whoop of joy and sprang  out into view.    Reddy looked up and tried to grin, but made a face of pain instead. You  see, it hurt so to move.    \"I suppose you're tickled to death to see me like this,\" he growled to  Peter Rabbit.    Now Peter had every reason to be glad, for Reddy Fox had tried his best  to catch Peter Rabbit to give to old Granny Fox for her dinner, and time  and again Peter had just barely escaped. So at first Peter Rabbit had  whooped with joy. But as he saw how very helpless Reddy really was and  how much pain he felt, suddenly Peter Rabbit's big, soft eyes filled  with tears of pity.    He forgot all about the threats of Reddy Fox and how Reddy had tried to  trick him. "]]]
