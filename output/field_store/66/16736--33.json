Its publication  was appropriate. There are moments when every one is inclined to praise,  especially when the praise of a new pen may at the same time revenge the  insults of an old one.    But if there could be any doubt of the success of this new hand, it was  quickly removed by the conduct of Peter Pindar himself. As is not  unusual with persons of his habits, Wolcot was extremely sensitive, and,  brandishing a tomahawk, always himself shrank from a scratch. This was  shown some years afterwards by his violent assault on Mr. Gifford, with  a bludgeon, in a bookseller's shop, because the author of the \"Baviad  and Maeviad\" had presumed to castigate the great lampooner of the age. In  the present instance, the furious Wolcot leapt to the rash conclusion,  that the author of the satire was no less a personage than Mr. Hayley,  and he assailed the elegant author of the \"Triumphs of Temper\" in a  virulent pasquinade. This ill-considered movement of his adversary of  course achieved the complete success of the anonymous writer.    My father, who came up to town to read the newspapers at the St. James's  Coffee-house, found their columns filled with extracts from the  fortunate effusion of the hour, conjectures as to its writer, and much  gossip respecting Wolcot and Hayley. He returned to Enfield laden with  the journals, and, presenting them to his parents, broke to them the  intelligence, that at length he was not only an author, but a successful  one.    He was indebted to this slight effort for something almost as agreeable  as the public recognition of his ability, and that was the acquaintance,  and almost immediately the warm personal friendship, of Mr. Pye. Mr. Pye  was the head of an ancient English family that figured in the  Parliaments and struggles of the Stuarts; he was member for the County  of Berkshire, where his ancestral seat of Faringdon was situate, and at  a later period (1790) became Poet Laureat. In those days, when literary  clubs did not exist, and when even political ones were extremely limited  and exclusive in their character, the booksellers' shops were social  rendezvous. Debrett's was the chief haunt of the Whigs; Hatchard's, I  believe, of the Tories. It was at the latter house that my father made  the acquaintance of Mr. Pye, then publishing his translation of  Aristotle's Poetics, and so strong was party feeling at that period,  that one day, walking together down Piccadilly, Mr. Pye, stopping at the  door of Debrett, requested his companion to go in and purchase a  particular pamphlet for him, adding that if he had the audacity to  enter, more than one person would tread upon his toes.    My father at last had a friend. Mr. Pye, though double his age, was  still a young man, and the literary sympathy between them was complete.  Unfortunately, the member for Berkshire was a man rather of an elegant  turn of mind, than one of that energy and vigour which a youth required  for a companion at that moment. Their tastes and pursuits were perhaps a  little too similar. They addressed poetical epistles to each other, and  were, reciprocally, too gentle critics. But Mr. Pye was a most amiable  and accomplished man, a fine classical scholar, and a master of correct  versification. He paid a visit to Enfield, and by his influence hastened  a conclusion at which my grandfather was just arriving, to wit, that he  would no longer persist in the fruitless effort of converting a poet  into a merchant, and that content with the independence he had realised,  he would abandon his dreams of founding a dynasty of financiers. From  this moment all disquietude ceased beneath this always well-meaning,  though often perplexed, roof, while my father, enabled amply to gratify  his darling passion of book-collecting, passed his days in tranquil  study, and in the society of congenial spirits.    His new friend introduced him almost immediately to Mr. James Pettit  Andrews, a Berkshire gentleman of literary pursuits, and whose  hospitable table at Brompton was the resort of the best literary society  of the day. Here my father was a frequent guest, and walking home one  night together from this house, where they had both dined, he made the  acquaintance of a young poet, which soon ripened into intimacy, and  which throughout sixty years, notwithstanding many changes of life,  never died away. This youthful poet had already gained laurels, though  he was only three or four years older than my father, but I am not at  this moment quite aware whether his brow was yet encircled with the  amaranthine wreath of the \"Pleasures of Memory.\"    Some years after this, great vicissitudes unhappily occurred in the  family of Mr. Pye. He was obliged to retire from Parliament, and to sell  his family estate of Faringdon. His Majesty had already, on the death of  Thomas Warton, nominated him Poet Laureat, and after his retirement from  Parliament, the government which he had supported, appointed him a  Commissioner of Police. It was in these days that his friend, Mr. Penn,  of Stoke Park, in Buckinghamshire, presented him with a cottage worthy  of a poet on his beautiful estate; and it was thus my father became  acquainted with the amiable descendant of the most successful of  colonisers, and with that classic domain which the genius of Gray, as it  were, now haunts, and has for ever hallowed, and from which he beheld  with fond and musing eye, those        Distant spires and antique towers,    that no one can now look upon without remembering him. It was amid these  rambles in Stoke Park, amid the scenes of Gray's genius, the elegiac  churchyard, and the picturesque fragments of the Long Story, talking  over the deeds of \"Great Rebellion\" with the descendants of Cavaliers  and Parliament-men, that my father first imbibed that feeling for the  county of Buckingham, which induced him occasionally to be a dweller in  its limits, and ultimately, more than a quarter of a century afterwards,  to establish his household gods in its heart. And here, perhaps, I may  be permitted to mention a circumstance, which is indeed trifling, and  yet, as a coincidence, not, I think, without interest. Mr. Pye was the  great-grandson of Sir Robert Pye, of Bradenham, who married Anne, the  eldest daughter of Mr. Hampden. How little could my father dream, sixty  years ago, that he would pass the last quarter of his life in the  mansion-house of Bradenham; that his name would become intimately  connected with the county of Buckingham; and that his own remains would  be interred in the vault of the chancel of Bradenham Church, among the  coffins of the descendants of the Hampdens and the Pyes. All which  should teach us that whatever may be our natural bent, there is a power  in the disposal of events greater than human will.    It was about two years after his first acquaintance with Mr. Pye, that  my father, being then in his twenty-fifth year, influenced by the circle  in which he then lived, gave an anonymous volume to the press, the fate  of which he could little have foreseen. The taste for literary history  was then of recent date in England. It was developed by Dr. Johnson and  the Wartons, who were the true founders of that elegant literature in  which France had so richly preceded us. The fashion for literary  anecdote prevailed at the end of the last century. Mr. Pettit Andrews,  assisted by Mr. Pye and Captain Grose, and shortly afterwards, his  friend, Mr. Seward, in his \"Anecdotes of Distinguished Persons,\" had  both of them produced ingenious works, which had experienced public  favour. But these volumes were rather entertaining than substantial, and  their interest in many instances was necessarily fleeting; all which  made Mr. Rogers observe, that the world was far gone in its anecdotage.    While Mr. Andrews and his friend were hunting for personal details in  the recollections of their contemporaries, my father maintained one day,  that the most interesting of miscellanies might be drawn up by a  well-read man from the library in which he lived. It was objected, on  the other hand, that such a work would be a mere compilation, and could  not succeed with its dead matter in interesting the public. To test the  truth of this assertion, my father occupied himself in the preparation  of an octavo volume, the principal materials of which were found in the  diversified collections of the French Ana; but he enriched his subjects  with as much of our own literature as his reading afforded, and he  conveyed the result in that lively and entertaining style which he from  the first commanded. This collection of \"Anecdotes, Characters,  Sketches, and Observations; Literary, Critical, and Historical,\" as the  title-page of the first edition figures, he invested with the happy  baptism of \"Curiosities of Literature.\"    He sought by this publication neither reputation nor a coarser reward,  for he published his work anonymously, and avowedly as a compilation;  and he not only published the work at his own expense, but in his  heedlessness made a present of the copyright to the bookseller, which  three or four years afterwards he was fortunate enough to purchase at a  public sale. The volume was an experiment whether a taste for literature  could not be infused into the multitude. Its success was so decided,  that its projector was tempted to add a second volume two years  afterward, with a slight attempt at more original research; I observe  that there was a second edition of both volumes in 1794. For twenty  years the brother volumes remained favourites of the public; when after  that long interval their writer, taking advantage of a popular title,  poured forth all the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2162"],[0,"Anarchism and Other Essays (#3)"],[1,"followed the  Chicago trial with great anxiety and excitement.  She, too, could not  believe that the leaders of the proletariat would be killed.  The  11th of November, 1887, taught her differently.  She realized that no  mercy could be expected from the ruling class, that between the  Tsarism of Russia and the plutocracy of America there was no  difference save in name.  Her whole being rebelled against the crime,  and she vowed to herself a solemn vow to join the ranks of the  revolutionary proletariat and to devote all her energy and strength  to their emancipation from wage slavery.  With the glowing enthusiasm  so characteristic of her nature, she now began to familiarize herself  with the literature of Socialism and Anarchism.  She attended public  meetings and became acquainted with socialistically and  anarchistically inclined workingmen.  Johanna Greie, the well-known  German lecturer, was the first Socialist speaker heard by Emma  Goldman.  In New Haven, Conn., where she was employed in a corset  factory, she met Anarchists actively participating in the movement.  Here she read the FREIHEIT, edited by John Most.  The Haymarket  tragedy developed her inherent Anarchist tendencies: the reading of  the FREIHEIT made her a conscious Anarchist.  Subsequently she was to  learn that the idea of Anarchism found its highest expression through  the best intellects of America: theoretically by Josiah Warren,  Stephen Pearl Andrews, Lysander Spooner; philosophically by Emerson,  Thoreau, and Walt Whitman.    Made ill by the excessive strain of factory work, Emma Goldman  returned to Rochester where she remained till August, 1889, at which  time she removed to New York, the scene of the most important phase  of her life.  She was now twenty years old.  Features pallid with  suffering, eyes large and full of compassion, greet one in her  pictured likeness of those days.  Her hair is, as customary with  Russian student girls, worn short, giving free play to the strong  forehead.      It is the heroic epoch of militant Anarchism.  By leaps and bounds  the movement had grown in every country.  In spite of the most severe  governmental persecution new converts swell the ranks.  The  propaganda is almost exclusively of a secret character.  The  repressive measures of the government drive the disciples of the new  philosophy to conspirative methods.  Thousands of victims fall into  the hands of the authorities and languish in prisons.  But nothing  can stem the rising tide of enthusiasm, of self-sacrifice and  devotion to the Cause.  The efforts of teachers like Peter Kropotkin,  Louise Michel, Elisee Reclus, and others, inspire the devotees with  ever greater energy.    Disruption is imminent with the Socialists, who have sacrificed the  idea of liberty and embraced the State and politics.  The struggle is  bitter, the factions irreconcilable.  This struggle is not merely  between Anarchists and Socialists; it also finds its echo within the  Anarchist groups.  Theoretic differences and personal controversies  lead to strife and acrimonious enmities.  The anti-Socialist  legislation of Germany and Austria had driven thousands of Socialists  and Anarchists across the seas to seek refuge in America.  John Most,  having lost his seat in the Reichstag, finally had to flee his native  land, and went to London.  There, having advanced toward Anarchism,  he entirely withdrew from the Social Democratic Party.  Later, coming  to America, he continued the publication of the FREIHEIT in New York,  and developed great activity among the German workingmen.    When Emma Goldman arrived in New York in 1889, she experienced little  difficulty in associating herself with active Anarchists.  Anarchist  meetings were an almost daily occurrence.  The first lecturer she  heard on the Anarchist platform was Dr. A. Solotaroff.  Of great  importance to her future development was her acquaintance with John  Most, who exerted a tremendous influence over the younger elements.  His impassioned eloquence, untiring energy, and the persecution he  had endured for the Cause, all combined to enthuse the comrades.  It  was also at this period that she met Alexander Berkman, whose  friendship played an important part throughout her life.  Her talents  as a speaker could not long remain in obscurity.  The fire of  enthusiasm swept her toward the public platform.  Encouraged by her  friends, she began to participate as a German and Yiddish speaker at  Anarchist meetings.  Soon followed a brief tour of agitation taking  her as far as Cleveland.  With the whole strength and earnestness of  her soul she now threw herself into the propaganda of Anarchist  ideas.  The passionate period of her life had begun.  Through  constantly toiling in sweat shops, the fiery young orator was at the  same time very active as an agitator and participated in various  labor struggles, notably in the great cloakmakers' strike, in 1889,  led by Professor Garsyde and Joseph Barondess.    A year later Emma Goldman was a delegate to an Anarchist conference  in New York.  She was elected to the Executive Committee, but later  withdrew because of differences of opinion regarding tactical  matters.  The ideas of the German-speaking Anarchists had at that  time not yet become clarified.  Some still believed in parliamentary  methods, the great majority being adherents of strong centralism.  These differences of opinion in regard to tactics led in 1891 to a  breach with John Most.  Emma Goldman, Alexander Berkman, and other  comrades joined the group AUTONOMY, in which Joseph Peukert, Otto  Rinke, and Claus Timmermann played an active part.  The bitter  controversies which followed this secession terminated only with the  death of Most, in 1906.    A great source of inspiration to Emma Goldman proved the Russian  revolutionists who were associated in the group ZNAMYA.  Goldenberg,  Solotaroff, Zametkin, Miller, Cahan, the poet Edelstadt, Ivan von  Schewitsch, husband of Helene von Racowitza and editor of the  VOLKSZEITUNG, and numerous other Russian exiles, some of whom are  still living, were members of this group.  It was also at this time  that Emma Goldman met Robert Reitzel, the German-American Heine, who  exerted a great influence on her development.  Through him she became  acquainted with the best writers of modern literature, and the  friendship thus begun lasted till Reitzel's death, in 1898.      The labor movement of America had not been drowned in the Chicago  massacre; the murder of the Anarchists had failed to bring peace to  the profit-greedy capitalist.  The struggle for the eight-hour day  continued.  In 1892 broke out the great strike in Pittsburg.  The  Homestead fight, the defeat of the Pinkertons, the appearance of the  militia, the suppression of the strikers, and the complete triumph of  the reaction are matters of comparatively recent history.  Stirred to  the very depths by the terrible events at the seat of war, Alexander  Berkman resolved to sacrifice his life to the Cause and thus give an  object lesson to the wage slaves of America of active Anarchist  solidarity with labor.  His attack upon Frick, the Gessler of  Pittsburg, failed, and the twenty-two-year-old youth was doomed to a  living death of twenty-two years in the penitentiary.  The  bourgeoisie, which for decades had exalted and eulogized tyrannicide,  now was filled with terrible rage.  The capitalist press organized a  systematic campaign of calumny and misrepresentation against  Anarchists.  The police exerted every effort to involve Emma Goldman  in the act of Alexander Berkman.  The feared agitator was to be  silenced by all means.  It was only due to the circumstance of her  presence in New York that she escaped the clutches of the law.  It  was a similar circumstance which, nine years later, during the  McKinley incident, was instrumental in preserving her liberty.  It is  almost incredible with what amount of stupidity, baseness, and  vileness the journalists of the period sought to overwhelm the  Anarchist.  One must peruse the newspaper files to realize the  enormity of incrimination and slander.  It would be difficult to  portray the agony of soul Emma Goldman experienced in those days.  The persecutions of the capitalist press were to be borne by an  Anarchist with comparative equanimity; but the attacks from one's own  ranks were far more painful and unbearable.  The act of Berkman was  severely criticized by Most and some of his followers among the  German and Jewish Anarchists.  Bitter accusations and recriminations  at public meetings and private gatherings followed.  Persecuted on  all sides, both because she championed Berkman and his act, and on  account of her revolutionary activity, Emma Goldman was harassed even  to the extent of inability to secure shelter.  Too proud to seek  safety in the denial of her identity, she chose to pass the nights in  the public parks rather than expose her friends to danger or vexation  by her visits.  The already bitter cup was filled to overflowing by  the attempted suicide of a young comrade who had shared living  quarters with Emma Goldman, Alexander Berkman, and a mutual artist  friend.      Many changes have since taken place.  Alexander Berkman has survived  the Pennsylvania Inferno, and is back again in the ranks of the  militant Anarchists, his spirit unbroken, his soul full of enthusiasm  for the ideals of his youth.  The artist comrade is now among the  well-known illustrators of New York.  The suicide candidate left  America shortly after his unfortunate attempt to die, and was  subsequently arrested and condemned to eight years of hard labor for  smuggling Anarchist literature into Germany.  He, too, has withstood  the terrors of prison life, and has returned to the revolutionary  movement, since earning the well deserved reputation of a talented  writer in Germany.
