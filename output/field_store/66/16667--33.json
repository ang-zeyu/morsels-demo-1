You are stimulating me.\"    \"But why should you want a girl like me to stimulate you? Surely  London is enough to do it without my help? You can always find  something new, surely? Listen, Mr. Marson. I was thrown on my own  resources about five years ago--never mind how. Since then I have  worked in a shop, done typewriting, been on the stage, had a  position as governess, been a lady's maid--\"    \"A what! A lady's maid?\"    \"Why not? It was all experience; and I can assure you I would  much rather be a lady's maid than a governess.\"    \"I think I know what you mean. I was a private tutor once. I  suppose a governess is the female equivalent. I have often  wondered what General Sherman would have said about private  tutoring if he expressed himself so breezily about mere war.

I'm twenty-three and I haven't  achieved anything much yet; but I certainly don't feel like  sitting back and calling myself a failure.\"    Ashe made a grimace.    \"All right,\" he said. \"I've got it.\"    \"I meant you to,\" said Joan placidly. \"I hope I haven't bored you  with my autobiography, Mr. Marson.

They  may contain just the opening you want.\"    \"Well, I'll do it; but my experience of advertisement pages is  that they are monopolized by philanthropists who want to lend you  any sum from ten to a hundred thousand pounds on your note of  hand only. However, I will scan them.\"    Joan rose and held out her hand.    \"Good-by, Mr. Marson. You've got your detective story to write,  and I have to think out something with a duke in it by to-night;  so I must be going.\" She smiled. \"We have traveled a good way  from the point where we started, but I may as well go back to it  before I leave you. I'm sorry I laughed at you this morning.\"    Ashe clasped her hand in a fervent grip.    \"I'm not. Come and laugh at me whenever you feel like it. I like  being laughed at. Why, when I started my morning exercises, half  of London used to come and roll about the sidewalks in  convulsions. I'm not an attraction any longer and it makes me  feel lonesome. There are twenty-nine of those Larsen Exercises  and you saw only part of the first. You have done so much for me  that if I can be of any use to you, in helping you to greet the  day with a smile, I shall be only too proud. Exercise Six is a  sure-fire mirth-provoker; I'll start with it to-morrow morning. I  can also recommend Exercise Eleven--a scream! Don't miss it.\"    \"Very well. Well, good-by for the present.\"    \"Good-by.\"    She was gone; and Ashe, thrilling with new emotions, stared at  the door which had closed behind her. He felt as though he had  been wakened from sleep by a powerful electric shock.    Close beside the sheet of paper on which he had inscribed the now  luminous and suggestive title of his new Gridley Quayle story lay  the Morning Post, the advertisement columns of which he had  promised her to explore. The least he could do was to begin at  once.    His spirits sank as he did so. It was the same old game. A Mr.  Brian MacNeill, though doing no business with minors, was  willing--even anxious--to part with his vast fortune to anyone  over the age of twenty-one whose means happened to be a trifle  straitened. This good man required no security whatever; nor did  his rivals in generosity, the Messrs. Angus Bruce, Duncan  Macfarlane, Wallace Mackintosh and Donald MacNab. They, too,  showed a curious distaste for dealing with minors; but anyone of  maturer years could simply come round to the office and help  himself.    Ashe threw the paper down wearily. He had known all along that it  was no good. Romance was dead and the unexpected no longer  happened. He picked up his pen and began to write \"The Adventure  of the Wand of Death.\"        CHAPTER II    In a bedroom on the fourth floor of the Hotel Guelph in  Piccadilly, the Honorable Frederick Threepwood sat in bed, with  his knees drawn up to his chin, and glared at the day with the  glare of mental anguish. He had very little mind, but what he had  was suffering.    He had just remembered. It is like that in this life. You wake  up, feeling as fit as a fiddle; you look at the window and see  the sun, and thank Heaven for a fine day; you begin to plan a  perfectly corking luncheon party with some of the chappies you  met last night at the National Sporting Club; and then--you  remember.    \"Oh, dash it!\" said the Honorable Freddie. And after a moment's  pause: \"And I was feeling so dashed happy!\"    For the space of some minutes he remained plunged in sad  meditation; then, picking up the telephone from the table at his  side, he asked for a number.    \"Hello!\"    \"Hello!\" responded a rich voice at the other end of the wire.    \"Oh, I say! Is that you, Dickie?\"    \"Who is that?\"    \"This is Freddie Threepwood. I say, Dickie, old top, I want to  see you about something devilish important. Will you be in at  twelve?\"    \"Certainly. What's the trouble?\"    \"I can't explain over the wire; but it's deuced serious.\"    \"Very well. By the way, Freddie, congratulations on the  engagement.\"    \"Thanks, old man. Thanks very much, and so on--but you won't  forget to be in at twelve, will you? Good-by.\"    He replaced the receiver quickly and sprang out of bed, for he  had heard the door handle turn. When the door opened he was  giving a correct representation of a young man wasting no time in  beginning his toilet for the day.    An elderly, thin-faced, bald-headed, amiably vacant man entered.  He regarded the Honorable Freddie with a certain disfavor.    \"Are you only just getting up, Frederick?\"    \"Hello, gov'nor. Good morning. I shan't be two ticks now.\"    \"You should have been out and about two hours ago. The day is  glorious.\"    \"Shan't be more than a minute, gov'nor, now. Just got to have a  tub and then chuck on a few clothes.\"    He disappeared into the bathroom. His father, taking a chair,  placed the tips of his fingers together and in this attitude  remained motionless, a figure of disapproval and suppressed  annoyance.    Like many fathers in his rank of life, the Earl of Emsworth had  suffered much through that problem which, with the exception of  Mr. Lloyd-George, is practically the only fly in the British  aristocratic amber--the problem of what to do with the younger  sons.    It is useless to try to gloss over the fact--in the aristocratic  families of Great Britain the younger son is not required.    Apart, however, from the fact that he was a younger son, and, as  such, a nuisance in any case, the honorable Freddie had always  annoyed his father in a variety of ways. The Earl of Emsworth was  so constituted that no man or thing really had the power to  trouble him deeply; but Freddie had come nearer to doing it than  anybody else in the world. There had been a consistency, a  perseverance, about his irritating performances that had acted on  the placid peer as dripping water on a stone. Isolated acts of  annoyance would have been powerless to ruffle his calm; but  Freddie had been exploding bombs under his nose since he went to  Eton.    He had been expelled from Eton for breaking out at night and  roaming the streets of Windsor in a false mustache.

Aristotle recognises that all his  cuttlefish are alike in structure. Among his Malacostraca he compares  point by point the external parts of the carabus (_Palinurus_), and  the astacus (_Homarus_), and he compares also the general internal  anatomy of the various \"genera\" he distinguishes. As regards Testacea,  he writes, \"The nature of their internal structure is similar in all,  especially in the turbinated animals, for they differ in size and in  the relations of excess; the univalves and bivalves do not exhibit  many differences\" (Cresswell, _loc. cit._, p. 83). There is an  interesting remark about \"the creature called carcinium\"  (hermit-crab), that it \"resembles both the Malacostraca and the  Testacea, for this in its nature is similar to the animals that are  like carabi, and it is born naked\" (Cresswell, _loc. cit._, p. 85). In  the last phrase we may perhaps read the first recognition of the  embryological criterion.    With the recognition of unity of plan within each group necessarily  goes the recognition of what later morphology calls the homology of  parts. The parts of a horse can be compared one by one with the parts  of another viviparous quadruped; in all the animals belonging to the  same class the parts are the same, only they differ in excess or  defect--these remarks are placed in the forefront of the _Historia  Animalium_. Generally speaking, parts which bear the same name are for  Aristotle homologous throughout the class. But he goes further and  notes the essential resemblance underlying the differences of certain  parts. He classes together nails and claws, the spines of the  hedgehog, and hair, as being homologous structures. He says that teeth  are allied to bones, whereas horns are more nearly allied to skin  (_Hist. Anim._, iii.). This is an astonishingly happy guess,  considering that all he had to go upon was the observation that in  black animals the horns are black but the teeth white. One cannot but  admire the way in which Aristotle fixes upon apparently trivial and  commonplace facts, and draws from them far-reaching consequences. He  often goes wrong, it is true, but he always errs in the grand manner.    While Aristotle certainly recognised the existence of homologies, and  even had a feeling for them, he did not clearly distinguish homology  from analogy. He comes pretty near the distinction in the following  passage. After explaining that in animals belonging to the same class  the parts are the same, differing only in excess or defect, he says,  \"But some animals agree with each other in their parts neither in form  nor in excess and defect, but have only an analogous likeness, such as  a bone bears to a spine, a nail to a hoof, a hand to a crab's claw,  the scale of a fish to the feather of a bird, for that which is a  feather in the bird is a scale in the fish\" (Cresswell, _loc. cit._,  p. 2). One of these comparisons is, however, a homology not an  analogy, and the last phrase throws a little doubt upon the whole  question, for it is not made clear whether it is position or function  that determines what are equivalent organs.    In the _De Partibus Animalium_ there occurs the following  passage:--\"Groups that only differ in degree, and in the more or less  of an identical element that they possess, are aggregated under a  single class; groups whose attributes are not identical but analogous  are separated. For instance, bird differs from bird by gradation, or  by excess and defect; some birds have long feathers, others short  ones, but all are feathered. Bird and Fish are more remote and only  agree in having analogous organs; for what in the bird is feather, in  the fish is scale. Such analogies can scarcely, however, serve  universally as indications for the formation of groups, for almost all  animals present analogies in their corresponding parts.\"[8] It is thus  similarity in form and structure which determines the formation of the  main groups. Within each group the parts differ only in degree, in  largeness or smallness, softness and hardness, smoothness or  roughness, and the like (_loc. cit._, i., 4, 644^b). These passages  show that Aristotle had some conception of homology as distinct from  analogy. He did not, however, develop the idea. What Aristotle sought  in the variety of animal structure, and what he found, were not  homologies, but rather communities of function, parts with the same  attributes. His interest was all in _organs_, in functioning parts,  not in the mere spatial relationship of parts.    This comes out clearly in his treatise _On the Parts of Animals_,  which is subsequent to, and the complement of, his _History of  Animals_. The latter is a description of the variety of animal form,  the former is a treatise on the functions of the parts. He describes  the plan of the _De Partibus Animalium_ as follows:--\"We have, then,  first to describe the common functions, common, that is, to the whole  animal kingdom, or to certain large groups, or to members of a  species. In other words, we have to describe the attributes common to  all animals, or to assemblages, like the class of Birds, of closely  allied groups differentiated by gradation, or to groups like Man not  differentiated into subordinate groups. In the first case the common  attributes may be called analogous, in the second generic, in the  third specific\" (i, 5, 645^b, trans. Ogle). The alimentary canal is a  good example of a part which is \"analogous\" throughout the animal  kingdom, for \"all animals possess in common those parts by which they  take in food, and into which they receive it\" (Cresswell, _loc. cit._,  p. 6).    The _De Partibus Animalium_ becomes in form a comparative  organography, but the emphasis is always on function and community of  function. Thus he treats of bone, \"fish-spine,\" and cartilage together  (_De Partibus_, ii., 9, 655^a), because they have the same function,  though he says elsewhere that they are only analogous structures (ii.,  8, 653^b). In the same connection he describes also the supporting  tissues of Invertebrates--the hard exoskeleton of Crustacea and  Insects, the shell of Testacea, the \"bone\" of _Sepia_ (ii., 8,  654^a). Aristotle took much more interest in analogies, in organs of  similar function, than in homologies. He did recognise the existence  of homologies, but rather _malgre lui_, because the facts forced it  upon him.    His only excursion into the realm of \"transcendental anatomy\" is his  comparison of a Cephalopod to a doubled-up Vertebrate whose legs have  become adherent to its head, whose alimentary canal has doubled upon  itself in such a way as to bring the anus near the mouth (_De  Partibus_, iv., 9, 684^b). It is clear, however, that Aristotle did  not seek to establish by this comparison any true homologies of parts,  but merely analogies, thus avoiding the error into which Meyranx and  Laurencet fell more than two thousand years later in their paper  communicated to the Academie des Sciences, which formed the  starting-point of the famous controversy between Cuvier and E.  Geoffroy St Hilaire (see Chap. V., below).    Moreover, Aristotle did not so much compare a Cephalopod with a  doubled-up Vertebrate as contrast Cephalopods (and also Testacea) with  all other animals. Other animals have their organs in a straight line;  Cephalopods and Testacea alone show this peculiar doubling up of the  body.    (4) Aristotle was much struck with certain facts of correlation, of  the interdependence of two organs which are not apparently in  functional dependence on one another. Such correlation may be positive  or negative; the presence of one organ may either entail the presence  of the other, or it may entail its absence. Aristotle has various ways  of explaining facts of correlation. He observed that no animal has  both tusks and horns, but this fact could easily be explained on the  principle that Nature never makes anything superfluous or in vain. If  an animal is protected by the possession of tusks it does not require  horns, and _vice versa_. The correlation of a multiple stomach with  deficient development of the teeth (as in Ruminants) is accounted for  by saying that the animal needs its complex stomach to make up for the  shortcomings of its teeth! (_De Partibus_, iii., 14, 674^b.) Other  examples of correlation were not susceptible of this explanation in  terms of final causes. He lays stress on the fact, in the main true,  of the inverse development of horns and front teeth in the upper jaw,  exemplified in Ruminants. He explains the fact in this way. Teeth and  horns are formed from earthy matter in the body and there is not  enough to form both teeth and horns, so \"Nature by subtracting from  the teeth adds to the horns; the nutriment which in most animals goes  to the former being here spent on the augmentation of the latter\" (_De  Partibus_, iii., 2, 664^a, trans. Ogle). A similar kind of explanation  is offered of the fact that Selachia have cartilage instead of bone,  \"in these Selachia Nature has used all the earthy matter on the skin  [_i.e._, on the placoid scales]; and she is unable to allot to many  different parts one and the same superfluity of material\" (_De  Partibus_, ii., 9, 655^a, trans. Ogle). Speaking generally, \"Nature  invariably gives to one part what she subtracts from another\" (_loc.  cit._, ii., 14, 658^a).    This thought reappears again in the 19th century in E. Geoffroy St  Hilaire's _loi de balancement_ and also in Goethe's writings on  morphology. For Aristotle it meant that Nature was limited by the  nature of her means, that finality was limited by necessity. Thus in  the larger animals there is an excess of earthy matter, as a necessary  result of the material nature of the animal; this excess is turned by  Nature to good account, but there is not enough to serve both for  teeth and "]]]
