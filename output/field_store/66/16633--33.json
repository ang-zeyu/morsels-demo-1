The best tobacco-fields in Bulgaria are on the northern  slopes of Rhodope, but the southern declivity, which produces the famous  Kavala growth, is more adapted to the cultivation of the plant. The  rose-fields of Kazanlyk and Karlovo lie in the sheltered valleys between  the Balkans and the parallel chains of the Sredna Gora and Karaja Dagh.  About 6000 lb of the rose-essence is annually exported, being valued from  L12 to L14 per lb. Beetroot is cultivated in the neighbourhood of Sofia.  Sericulture, formerly an important industry, has declined owing to disease  among the silkworms, but efforts are being made to revive it with promise  of success. Cotton is grown in the southern districts of Eastern Rumelia.    Peasant proprietorship is universal, the small freeholds averaging about 18  acres each. There are scarcely any large estates owned by individuals, but  some of the monasteries possess considerable domains. The large  _tchifliks_, or farms, formerly belonging to Turkish landowners, have been  divided among the peasants. The rural proprietors enjoy the right of  pasturing their cattle on the common lands belonging to each village, and  of cutting wood in the state forests. They live in a condition of rude  comfort, and poverty is practically unknown, except in the towns. A  peculiarly interesting feature in Bulgarian agricultural life is the  _zadruga_, or house-community, a patriarchal institution apparently dating  from prehistoric times. Family groups, sometimes numbering several dozen  persons, dwell together on a farm in the observance of strictly communistic  principles. The association is ruled by a house-father (_domakin_,  _stareishina_), and a house-mother (_domakinia_), who assign to the members  their respective tasks. In addition to the farm work the members often  practise various trades, the proceeds of which are paid into the general  treasury. The community sometimes includes a priest, whose fees for  baptisms, &c., augment the common fund. The national aptitude for  combination is also displayed in the associations of market gardeners  (_gradinarski druzhini_, _taifi_), who in the spring leave their native  districts for the purpose of cultivating gardens in the neighbourhood of  some town, either in Bulgaria or abroad, returning in the autumn, when they  divide the profits of the enterprise; the number of persons annually thus  engaged probably exceeds 10,000. Associations for various agricultural,  mining and industrial undertakings and provident societies are numerous:  the handicraftsmen in the towns are organized in _esnafs_ or gilds.    _Manufactures._--The development of manufacturing enterprise on a large  scale has been retarded by want of capital. The principal establishments  for the native manufactures of _aba_ and _shayak_ (rough and fine  homespuns), and of _gaitan_ (braided embroidery) are at Sliven and Gabrovo  respectively. The Bulgarian homespuns, which are made of pure wool, are of  admirable quality. The exportation of textiles is almost exclusively to  Turkey: value in 1806, L104,046; in 1898, L144,726; in 1904, L108,685.  Unfortunately the home demand for native fabrics is diminishing owing to  foreign competition; the smaller textile industries are declining, and the  picturesque, durable, and comfortable costume of the country is giving way  to cheap ready-made clothing imported from Austria. The government has  endeavoured to stimulate the home industry by ordering all persons in its  employment to wear the native cloth, and the army is supplied almost  exclusively by the factories at Sliven. A great number of small  distilleries exist throughout the country; there are breweries in all the  principal towns, tanneries at Sevlievo, Varna, &c., numerous corn-mills  worked by water and steam, and sawmills, turned by the mountain torrents,  in the Balkans and Rhodope. A certain amount of foreign capital has been  invested in industrial enterprises; the most notable are sugar-refineries  in the neighbourhood of Sofia and Philippopolis, and a cotton-spinning mill  at Varna, on which an English company has expended about L60,000.    _Commerce._--The usages of internal commerce have been considerably  modified by the development of communications. The primitive system of  barter in kind still exists in the rural districts, but is gradually  disappearing. The great fairs (_panairi_, [Greek: panegureis]) held at  Eski-Jumaia, Dobritch and other towns, which formerly attracted multitudes  of foreigners as well as natives, have lost much of their importance; a  considerable amount of business, however, is still transacted at these  gatherings, of which ninety-seven were held in 1898. The principal seats of  the export trade are Varna, Burgas and Baltchik on the Black Sea, and  Svishtov, Rustchuk, Nikopolis, Silistria, Rakhovo, and Vidin on the Danube.  The chief centres of distribution for imports are Varna, Sofia, Rustchuk,  Philippopolis and Burgas. About 10% of the exports passes over the Turkish  frontier, but the government is making great efforts to divert the trade to  Varna and Burgas, and important harbour works have been carried out at both  these ports. The new port of Burgas was formally opened in 1904, that of  Varna in 1906.    In 1887 the total value of Bulgarian foreign commerce was L4,419,589. The  following table gives the values for the six years ending 1904. The great  fluctuations in the exports are due to the variations of the harvest, on  which the prosperity of the country practically depends:--      Year.   Exports.     Imports.     Total.

Exports to the United Kingdom in 1900 were valued at  L239,665; in 1904 at L989,127. The principal imports are textiles, metal  goods, colonial goods, implements, furniture, leather, petroleum. Imports  from the United Kingdom in 1900, L301,150; in 1904, L793,972.    The National Bank, a state institution with a capital of L400,000, has its  central establishment at Sofia, and branches at Philippopolis, Rustchuk,  Varna, Trnovo and Burgas. Besides conducting the ordinary banking  operations, it issues loans on mortgage. Four other banks have been founded  at Sofia by groups of foreign and native capitalists. There are several  private banks in the country. The Imperial Ottoman Bank and the Industrial  Bank of Kiev have branches at Philippopolis and Sofia respectively. The  agricultural chests, founded by Midhat Pasha in 1863, and reorganized in  1894, have done much to rescue the peasantry from the hands of usurers.  They serve as treasuries for the local administration, accept deposits at  interest, and make loans to the peasants on mortgage or the security of two  solvent landowners at 8%. Their capital in 1887 was L569,260; in 1904,  L1,440,000. Since 1893 they have been constituted as the \"Bulgarian  Agricultural Bank\"; the central direction is at Sofia. The post-office  savings bank, established 1896, had in 1905 a capital of L1,360,560.    There are over 200 registered provident societies in the country. The legal  rate of interest is 10%, but much higher rates are not uncommon.    Bulgaria, like the neighbouring states of the Peninsula, has adopted the  metric system. Turkish weights and measures, however, are still largely  employed in local commerce. The monetary unit is the _lev_, or \"lion\" (pl.  _leva_), nominally equal to the franc, with its submultiple the _stotinka_  (pl. _-ki_), or centime. The coinage consists of nickel and bronze coins  (21/2, 5, 10 and 20 _stotinki_) and silver coins [v.04 p.0776] (50  _stotinki_; 1, 2 and 5 _leva_). A gold coinage was struck in 1893 with  pieces corresponding to those of the Latin Union. The Turkish pound and  foreign gold coins are also in general circulation. The National Bank  issues notes for 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 _leva_, payable in gold. Notes  payable in silver are also issued.    _Finance._--It is only possible here to deal with Bulgarian finance prior  to the declaration of independence in 1908. At the outset of its career the  principality was practically unencumbered with any debt, external or  internal. The stipulations of the Berlin Treaty (Art. ix.) with regard to  the payment of a tribute to the sultan and the assumption of an \"equitable  proportion\" of the Ottoman Debt were never carried into effect. In 1883 the  claim of Russia for the expenses of the occupation (under Art. xx. of the  treaty) was fixed at 26,545,625 fr. (L1,061,820) payable in annual  instalments of 2,100,000 fr. (L84,000). The union with Eastern Rumelia in  1885 entailed liability for the obligations of that province consisting of  an annual tribute to Turkey of 2,951,000 fr. (L118,040) and a loan of  3,375,000 fr. (L135,000) contracted with the Imperial Ottoman Bank. In 1888  the purchase of the Varna-Rustchuk railway was effected by the issue of  treasury bonds at 6% to the vendors. In 1889 a loan of 30,000,000 fr.  (L1,200,000) bearing 6% interest was contracted with the Vienna Laenderbank  and Bankverein at 851/2. In 1892 a further 6% loan of 142,780,000 fr.  (L5,711,200) was contracted with the Laenderbank at 83, 86 and 89. In 1902 a  5% loan of 106,000,000 fr. (L4,240,000), secured on the tobacco dues and  the stamp-tax, was contracted with the Banque de l'Etat de Russie and the  Banque de Paris et des Pays Bas at 811/2, for the purpose of consolidating  the floating debt, and in 1904 a 5% loan of 99,980,000 fr. (L3,999,200) at  82, with the same guarantees, was contracted with the last-named bank  mainly for the"]]]
