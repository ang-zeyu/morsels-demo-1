Alas, alas, for the things  which have touched Me!... I swear by the Most Great Lord! Wert thou to be  told in what place I dwell, the first person to have mercy on Me would be  thyself. In the heart of a mountain is a fortress [Maku] ... the inmates  of which are confined to two guards and four dogs. Picture, then, My  plight.... In this mountain I have remained alone, and have come to such a  pass that none of those gone before Me have suffered what I have suffered,  nor any transgressor endured what I have endured!\"    \"How veiled are ye, O My creatures,\" He, speaking with the voice of God,  has revealed in the Bayan, \"...who, without any right, have consigned Him  unto a mountain [Maku], not one of whose inhabitants is worthy of  mention.... With Him, which is with Me, there is no one except him who is  one of the Letters of the Living of My Book. In His presence, which is My  Presence, there is not at night even a lighted lamp! And yet, in places  [of worship] which in varying degrees reach out unto Him, unnumbered lamps  are shining! All that is on earth hath been created for Him, and all  partake with delight of His benefits, and yet they are so veiled from Him  as to refuse Him even a lamp!\"    What of Baha'u'llah, the germ of Whose Revelation, as attested by the Bab,  is endowed with a potency superior to the combined forces of the Babi  Dispensation? Was He not--He for Whom the Bab had suffered and died in such  tragic and miraculous circumstances--made, for nearly half a century and  under the domination of the two most powerful potentates of the East, the  object of a systematic and concerted conspiracy which, in its effects and  duration, is scarcely paralleled in the annals of previous religions?    \"The cruelties inflicted by My oppressors,\" He Himself in His anguish has  cried out, \"have bowed Me down, and turned My hair white. Shouldst thou  present thyself before My throne, thou wouldst fail to recognize the  Ancient Beauty, for the freshness of His countenance is altered and its  brightness hath faded, by reason of the oppression of the infidels. I  swear by God! His heart, His soul, and His vitals are melted!\" \"Wert thou  to hear with Mine ear,\" He also declares, \"thou wouldst hear how 'Ali [the  Bab] bewaileth Me in the presence of the Glorious Companion, and how  Muhammad weepeth over Me in the all-highest Horizon, and how the Spirit  [Jesus] beateth Himself upon the head in the heaven of My decree, by  reason of what hath befallen this Wronged One at the hands of every  impious sinner.\" \"Before Me,\" He elsewhere has written, \"riseth up the  Serpent of wrath with jaws stretched to engulf Me, and behind Me stalketh  the lion of anger intent on tearing Me in pieces, and above Me, O My  Well-Beloved, are the clouds of Thy decree, raining upon Me the showers of  tribulations, whilst beneath Me are fixed the spears of misfortune, ready  to wound My limbs and My body.\" \"Couldst thou be told,\" He further  affirms, \"what hath befallen the Ancient Beauty, thou wouldst flee into  the wilderness, and weep with a great weeping. In thy grief, thou wouldst  smite thyself on the head, and cry out as one stung by the sting of the  adder.... By the righteousness of God! Every morning I arose from My bed I  discovered the hosts of countless afflictions massed behind My door, and  every night when I lay down, lo! My heart was torn with agony at what it  had suffered from the fiendish cruelty of its foes. With every piece of  bread the Ancient Beauty breaketh is coupled the assault of a fresh  affliction, and with every drop He drinketh is mixed the bitterness of the  most woeful of trials. He is preceded in every step He taketh by an army  of unforeseen calamities, while in His rear follow legions of agonizing  sorrows.\"    Was it not He Who, at the early age of twenty-seven, spontaneously arose  to champion, in the capacity of a mere follower, the nascent Cause of the  Bab? Was He not the One Who by assuming the actual leadership of a  proscribed and harrassed sect exposed Himself, and His kindred, and His  possessions, and His rank, and His reputation to the grave perils, the  bloody assaults, the general spoliation and furious defamations of both  government and people? Was it not He--the Bearer of a Revelation, Whose day  \"every Prophet hath announced,\" for which \"the soul of every Divine  Messenger hath thirsted,\" and in which \"God hath proved the hearts of the  entire company of His Messengers and Prophets\"--was not the Bearer of such  a Revelation, at the instigation of _Sh_i'ih ecclesiastics and by order of  the _Sh_ah himself forced, for no less than four months, to breathe, in  utter darkness, whilst in the company of the vilest criminals and  freighted down with galling chains, the pestilential air of the  vermin-infested subterranean dungeon of Tihran--a place which, as He  Himself subsequently declared, was mysteriously converted into the very  scene of the annunciation made to Him by God of His Prophethood?    \"We were consigned,\" He wrote in His \"Epistle to the Son of the Wolf,\"  \"for four months to a place foul beyond comparison. As to the dungeon in  which this Wronged One and others similarly wronged were confined, a dark  and narrow pit were preferable.... The dungeon was wrapped in thick  darkness, and Our fellow prisoners numbered nearly a hundred and fifty  souls: thieves, assassins, and highwaymen. Though crowded, it had no other  outlet than the passage by which We entered. No pen can depict that place,  nor any tongue describe its loathsome smell. Most of these men had neither  clothes nor bedding to lie on. God alone knoweth what befell Us in that  most foul-smelling and gloomy place!\" \"'Abdu'l-Baha,\" writes Dr. J.E.  Esslemont, \"tells how one day He was allowed to enter the prison-yard to  see His beloved Father when He came out for His daily exercise.  Baha'u'llah was terribly altered, so ill He could hardly walk. His hair  and beard unkempt, His neck galled and swollen from the pressure of a  heavy steel collar, His body bent by the weight of His chains.\" \"For three  days and three nights,\" Nabil has recorded in his chronicle, \"no manner of  food or drink was given to Baha'u'llah. Rest and sleep were both  impossible to Him. The place was infested with vermin, and the stench of  that gloomy abode was enough to crush the very spirits of those who were  condemned to suffer its horrors.\" \"Such was the intensity of His suffering  that the marks of that cruelty remained imprinted upon His body all the  days of His life.\"    And what of the other tribulations which, before and immediately after  this dreadful episode, touched Him? What of His confinement in the home of  one of the kad-_kh_udas of Tihran? What of the savage violence with which  He was stoned by the angry people in the neighborhood of the village of  Niyala? What of His incarceration by the emissaries of the army of the  _Sh_ah in Mazindaran, and His receiving the bastinado by order, and in the  presence, of the assembled siyyids and mujtahids into whose hands He had  been delivered by the civil authorities of Amul? What of the howls of  derision and abuse with which a crowd of ruffians subsequently pursued  Him? What of the monstrous accusation brought against Him by the Imperial  household, the Court and the people, when the attempt was made on the life  of Nasiri'd-Din _Sh_ah? What of the infamous outrages, the abuse and  ridicule heaped on Him when He was arrested by responsible officers of the  government, and conducted from Niyavaran \"on foot and in chains, with  bared head and bare feet,\" and exposed to the fierce rays of the midsummer  sun, to the Siyah-_Ch_al of Tihran? What of the avidity with which corrupt  officials sacked His house and carried away all His possessions and  disposed of His fortune? What of the cruel edict that tore Him from the  small band of the Bab's bewildered, hounded, and shepherdless followers,  separated Him from His kinsmen and friends, and banished Him, in the depth  of winter, despoiled and defamed, to 'Iraq?    Severe as were these tribulations which succeeded one another with  bewildering rapidity as a result of the premeditated attacks and the  systematic machinations of the court, the clergy, the government and the  people, they were but the prelude to a harrowing and extensive captivity  which that edict had formally initiated. Extending over a period of more  than forty years, and carrying Him successively to 'Iraq, Sulaymaniyyih,  Constantinople, Adrianople and finally to the penal colony of Akka, this  long banishment was at last ended by His death, at the age of over three  score years and ten, terminating a captivity which, in its range, its  duration and the diversity and severity of its afflictions, is unexampled  in the history of previous Dispensations.

In the  Manifestation of God, the perfectly polished mirror, appear the qualities  of the Divine in a form that man is capable of comprehending.    This is so simple that all can understand it, and that which we are able  to understand we must perforce accept.    Our Father will not hold us responsible for the rejection of dogmas which  we are unable either to believe or comprehend, for He is ever infinitely  just to His children.    This example is, however, so logical that it can easily be grasped by all  minds willing to give it their consideration.    May each one of you become a shining lamp, of which the flame is the Love  of God. May your hearts burn with the radiance of unity. May your eyes be  illumined with the effulgence of the Sun of Truth!    The city of Paris is very beautiful, a more civilized and well-appointed  town in all material development it would be impossible to find in the  present world. But the spiritual light has not shone upon her for a long  time: her spiritual progress is far behind that of her material  civilization. A supreme power is needed to awaken her to the reality of  spiritual truth, to breathe the breath of life into her dormant soul. You  must all unite in this work of arousing her, in reanimating her people by  the help of that Superior Force.    When an illness is slight a small remedy will suffice to heal it, but when  the slight illness becomes a terrible disease, then a very strong remedy  must be used by the Divine Healer. There are some trees that blossom and  bear fruit in a cool climate, others there are which need the hottest rays  of the sun to bring them to perfect maturity. Paris is one of those trees  for whose spiritual unfoldment a great flaming Sun of the Divine Power of  God is needed.    I ask you all, each one of you, to follow well the light of truth, in the  Holy Teachings, and God will strengthen you by His Holy Spirit so that you  will be enabled to overcome the difficulties, and to destroy the  prejudices which cause separation and hatred amongst the people. Let your  hearts be filled with the great love of God, let it be felt by all; for  every man is a servant of God, and all are entitled to a share of the  Divine Bounty.    Especially to those whose thoughts are material and retrograde show the  utmost love and patience, thereby winning them into the unity of  fellowship by the radiance of your kindness.    If you are faithful to your great work, following the Holy Sun of Truth  without swerving, then will the blessed day of universal brotherhood dawn  on this beautiful city.          THE PITIFUL CAUSES OF WAR, AND THE DUTY OF EVERYONE TO STRIVE FOR PEACE      October 21st    'Abdu'l-Baha said:    I hope you are all happy and well. I am not happy, but very sad. The news  of the Battle of Benghazi grieves my heart. I wonder at the human savagery  that still exists in the world! How is it possible for men to fight from  morning until evening, killing each other, shedding the blood of their  fellow-men: And for what object? To gain possession of a part of the  earth! Even the animals, when they fight, have an immediate and more  reasonable cause for their attacks! How terrible it is that men, who are  of the higher kingdom, can descend to slaying and bringing misery to their  fellow-beings, for the possession of a tract of land!    The highest of created beings fighting to obtain the lowest form of  matter, earth! Land belongs not to one people, but to all people. This  earth is not man's home, but his tomb. It is for their tombs these men are  fighting. There is nothing so horrible in this world as the tomb, the  abode of the decaying bodies of men.    However great the conqueror, however many countries he may reduce to  slavery, he is unable to retain any part of these devastated lands but one  tiny portion--his tomb! If more land is required for the improvement of the  condition of the people, for the spread of civilization (for the  substitution of just laws for brutal customs)--surely it would be possible  to acquire peaceably the necessary extension of territory.    But war is made for the satisfaction of men's ambition; for the sake of  worldly gain to the few, terrible misery is brought to numberless homes,  breaking the hearts of hundreds of men and women!    How many widows mourn their husbands, how many stories of savage cruelty  do we hear! How many little orphaned children are crying for their dead  fathers, how many women are weeping for their slain sons!    There is nothing so heart-breaking and terrible as an outburst of human  savagery!    I charge you all that each one of you concentrate all the thoughts of your  heart on love and unity. When a thought of war comes, oppose it by a  stronger thought of peace. A thought of hatred must be destroyed by a more  powerful thought of love. Thoughts of war bring destruction to all  harmony, well-being, restfulness and content.    Thoughts of love are constructive of brotherhood, peace, friendship, and  happiness.    When soldiers of the world draw their swords to kill, soldiers of God  clasp each other's hands! So may all the savagery of man disappear by the  Mercy of God, working through the pure in heart and the sincere of soul.  Do not think the peace of the world an ideal impossible to attain!    Nothing is impossible to the Divine Benevolence of God.    If you desire with all your heart, friendship with every race on earth,  your thought, spiritual and positive, will spread; it will become the  desire of others, growing stronger and stronger, until it reaches the  minds of all men.    Do not despair! Work steadily. Sincerity and love will conquer hate. How  many seemingly impossible events are coming to pass in these days! Set  your faces steadily towards the Light of the World. Show love to all;  'Love is the breath of the Holy Spirit in the heart of Man'. Take courage!  God never forsakes His children who strive and work and pray! Let your  hearts be filled with the strenuous desire that tranquillity and harmony  may encircle all this warring world. So will success crown your efforts,  and with the universal brotherhood will come the Kingdom of God in peace  and goodwill.    In this room today are members of many races, French, American, English,  German, Italian, brothers and sisters meeting in friendship and harmony!  Let this gathering be a foreshadowing of what will, in very truth, take  place in this world, when every child of God realizes that they are leaves  of one tree, flowers in one garden, drops in one ocean, and sons and  daughters of one Father, whose name is love!          THE SUN OF TRUTH      October 22nd    'Abdu'l-Baha said:    It is a lovely day, the sun shines brightly upon the earth, giving light  and warmth to all creatures. The Sun of Truth is also shining, giving  light and warmth to the souls of men. The sun is the life-giver to the  physical bodies of all creatures upon earth; without its warmth their  growth would be stunted, their development would be arrested, they would  decay and die. Even so do the souls of men need the Sun of Truth to shed  its rays upon their souls, to develop them, to educate and encourage them.  As the sun is to the body of a man so is the Sun of Truth to his soul.    A man may have attained to a high degree of material progress, but without  the light of truth his soul is stunted and starved. Another man may have  no material gifts, may be at the bottom of the social ladder, but, having  received the warmth of the Sun of Truth his soul is great and his  spiritual understanding is enlightened.    A Greek philosopher living in the days of the youth of Christianity, being  full of the Christian element, though not a professing Christian, wrote  thus: 'It is my belief that religion is the very foundation of true  civilization'. For, unless the moral character of a nation is educated, as  well as its brain and its talents, civilization has no sure basis.    As religion inculcates morality, it is therefore the truest philosophy,  and on it is built the only lasting civilization. As an example of this,  he points out the Christians of the time whose morality was on a very high  level. The belief of this philosopher conforms to the truth, for the  civilization of Christianity was the best and most enlightened in the  world. The Christian Teaching was illumined by the Divine Sun of Truth,  therefore its followers were taught to love all men as brothers to fear  nothing, not even death! To love their neighbours as themselves, and to  forget their own selfish interests in striving for the greater good of  humanity. The grand aim of the religion of Christ was to draw the hearts  of all men nearer to God's effulgent Truth.    If the followers of the Lord Christ had continued to follow out these  principles with steadfast faithfulness, there would have been no need for  a renewal of the Christian Message, no necessity for a re-awakening of His  people, for a great and glorious civilization would now be ruling the  world and the Kingdom of Heaven would have come on earth.    But instead of this, what has taken place! Men turned away their faces  from following the divinely illuminated precepts of their Master, and  winter fell upon the hearts of men. For, as the body of man depends for  life upon the rays of the sun, so cannot the celestial virtues grow in the  soul without the radiance of the Sun of Truth.    God leaves not His children comfortless, but, when the darkness of winter  overshadows them, then again He sends His Messengers, the Prophets, with a  renewal of the blessed spring. The Sun of Truth appears again on the  horizon of the world shining into the eyes of those who sleep, awaking  them to behold the glory of a new dawn. Then again will the tree of  humanity blossom and bring forth the fruit of righteousness for the  healing of the nations. Because man has stopped"]]]
