The modern staff has five lines and six  spaces, these being ordinarily referred to as first line, second line,  third line, fourth line, and fifth line (beginning with the lowest); and  space below (_i.e._, space below the first line), first space, second  space, third space, fourth space, and space above.    The definition and discussion above refer more specifically to one of  the portions of the \"great staff,\" the latter term being often applied  to the combination of treble and bass staffs (with one leger line  between) so commonly used in piano music, etc.    13. The _extent of the staff_ may be increased either above or below by  the addition of short lines called _leger lines_,[4] and notes may be  written on either these lines or on the spaces above and below them.    [Footnote 4: The word _leger_ is derived from the French word _LEGER_,  meaning light, and this use of the word refers to the fact that the  leger lines, being added by hand, are lighter--_i.e._, less solid in  color--than the printed lines of the staff itself.]    14. The lines and spaces constituting the staff (including leger lines  if any) are often referred to as _staff degrees_, _i.e._, each separate  line and space is considered to be \"a degree of the staff.\" The tones of  a scale are also sometimes referred to as \"degrees of the scale.\"    15. A _clef_[5] is a sign placed on the staff to designate what pitches  are to be represented by its lines and spaces. Thus, _e.g._, the G clef  shows us not only that the second line of the staff represents G, but  that the first line represents E, the first space F, etc. The F clef  similarly shows us that the fifth line of the bass staff represents the  first A below middle C, the fourth line the first F below middle C, etc.    [Footnote 5: The word _clef_ is derived from _CLAVIS_--a key--the  reference being to the fact that the clef unlocks or makes clear the  meaning of the staff, as a key to a puzzle enables us to solve the  puzzle.]    The student should note that these clefs are merely modified forms of  the letters G and F, which (among others) were used to designate the  pitches represented by certain lines when staff notation was first  inaugurated. For a fuller discussion of this matter see Appendix A, p.  101. [Transcriber's Note: Corrected error \"Appendix I\" in original.]    16. When the G clef is used the staff is usually referred to as the  _treble staff_, and when the F clef is used, as the _bass staff_. Such  expressions as \"singing from the treble clef,\" or \"singing in the treble  clef,\" and \"singing in the bass clef\" are still frequently heard, but  are preferably replaced by \"singing from the treble staff,\" and \"singing  from the bass staff.\" Fig. 6 shows the permanent names of lines and  spaces when the G and F clefs are used.[6]    [Footnote 6: The Germans use the same pitch designations as we do with  two exceptions, viz., our B is called by them H, and our B[flat] is  called B. The scale of C therefore reads: C, D, E, F, G, A, H, C; the  scale of F reads F, G, A, B, C, D, E, F. The signatures are in all cases  written exactly as we write them.    In France and Italy where the \"fixed DO\" system is in vogue, pitches are  usually referred to by the syllable names; _e.g._, C is referred to as  DO (or UT), D as RE, etc.]    [Illustration: Fig. 6.]    17. _The movable C clef_ [C clef symbol] or [tenor clef symbol],  formerly in very common use, is now utilized for only two purposes,  viz., (1) in music written for certain orchestral instruments (cello,  viola, etc.) of extended range, in order to avoid having to use too many  leger lines; and (2) for indicating the tenor part in vocal music. This  latter usage seems also to be disappearing however, and the tenor part  is commonly written on the treble staff, it being understood that the  tones are to be sung an octave lower than the notes would indicate.    The C clef as used in its various positions is shown in Figs. 7, 8, and  9. It will be noted that in each case the line on which the clef is  placed represents \"middle C.\"    [Illustration: Fig. 7. Soprano clef.]    [Illustration: Fig. 8. Alto clef.]    [Illustration: Fig. 9. Tenor clef.]    18. A _sharp_ is a character which causes the degree of the staff with  which it is associated to represent a pitch one half-step higher than it  otherwise would.         Thus in Fig. 10 (_a_) the fifth line and first space represent       the pitch F, but in Fig. 10 (_b_) these same staff degrees       represent an entirely different tone--F[sharp]. The student       should note that the sharp does not then _raise_ anything; it       merely causes a staff degree to represent a higher tone than       it otherwise would. There is just as much difference between F       and F[sharp] as between B and C, and yet one would never think       of referring to C as \"B raised\"!    [Illustration: Fig. 10.]    19. A _flat_ is a character that causes the degree of the staff with  which it is associated to represent a tone one half-step lower than it  otherwise would. (See note under Sec. 18 and apply the same discussion  here.)    20. A _double-sharp_ causes the staff degree on which it is placed to  represent a pitch one whole-step higher than it would without any sharp.  Similarly, a double-flat causes the staff degree on which it is placed  to represent a pitch one whole-step lower than it would without any  flat.         Double-sharps and double-flats are generally used on staff       degrees that have already been sharped or flatted, therefore       their practical effect is to cause staff degrees to represent       pitches respectively a half-step higher and a half-step lower       than would be represented by those same degrees in their       diatonic condition. Thus in Fig. 10 (_b_) the first space in       its diatonic condition[7] represents F-sharp, and the       double-sharp on this degree would cause it to represent a       pitch one-half step higher than F-sharp, _i.e._,       F-double-sharp.    [Footnote 7: The expression \"diatonic condition\" as here used refers to  the staff after the signature has been placed upon it, in other words  after the staff has been prepared to represent the pitches of the  diatonic scale.]          CHAPTER III    SYMBOLS OF MUSIC DEFINED (_Continued_)      21. The _natural_[8] (sometimes called _cancel_) annuls the effect of  previous sharps, flats, double-sharps, and double-flats, within the  measure in which it occurs. After a double-sharp or double-flat the  combination of a natural with a sharp, or a natural with a flat is often  found: in this case only one sharp or flat is annulled. (Sometimes also  the single sharp or flat will be found by itself, cancelling the  double-sharp or double-flat). The natural is often used when a  composition changes key, as in Fig. 11, where a change from E to G is  shown.    [Footnote 8: It has already been noted (p. 6, Note) that in the German  scale our b-flat is called b, and our b is called H. From this  difference in terminology has grown up the custom of using the H (now  made [natural]) to show that _any_ staff-degree is in _natural_  condition, _i.e._, not sharped or flatted.]    [Illustration: Fig. 11.]    22. The group of sharps or flats (or absence of them) at the beginning  of a staff partially indicates the key in which the composition is  written. They are called collectively the _key-signature_.    23. The same key-signature may stand for either one of two keys, the  major key, or its relative minor, hence in order to determine in what  key a melody is one must note whether the tones are grouped about the  major tonic DO or the minor tonic LA. In a harmonized composition it is  almost always possible to determine the key by referring to the last  bass note; if the final chord is clearly the DO chord the composition is  in the major key, but if this final chord is clearly the LA chord then  it is almost certain that the entire composition is in the minor key.  Thus if a final chord appears as that in Fig. 12 the composition is  clearly in G major, while if it appears as in Fig. 13, it is just as  surely in E minor.    [Illustration: Fig. 12.]    [Illustration: Fig. 13.]    24. Sharps, flats, naturals, double-sharps and double-flats, occurring  in the course of the composition (_i.e._, after the key signature) are  called _accidentals_, whether they actually cause a staff degree to  represent a different pitch as in Fig. 14 or simply make clear a  notation about which there might otherwise be some doubt as in Fig. 15,  measure two. The effect of such accidentals terminates at the bar.    [Illustration: Fig. 14.]    [Illustration: Fig. 15.]    25. In the case of a _tie across a bar_ an accidental remains in force  until the combined value of the tied notes expires. In Fig. 16 first  measure, third beat, an accidental sharp makes the third space represent  the pitch C sharp. By virtue of the tie across the bar the third space  continues to represent C sharp thru the first beat of the second  measure, but for the remainder of the measure the third space will  represent C unless the sharp is repeated as in Fig. 17.    [Illustration: Fig. 16.]    [Illustration: Fig. 17.]    26. The following rules for making staff degrees represent pitches  different from those of the diatonic scale will be found useful by the  beginner in the study of music notation. These rules are quoted from  \"The Worcester Musical Manual,\" by Charles I. Rice.         1. To sharp a natural degree, use a sharp. Fig. 18.       2. To sharp a sharped degree, use a double sharp. Fig. 19.       3. To sharp a flatted degree, use a natural. Fig. 20.       4. To flat a natural degree, use a flat. Fig. 21.       5. To flat a flatted degree, use a double flat. Fig. 22.       6. To flat a sharped degree, use a natural. Fig. 23.

In a few moments my pain ceased; a  drowsy, heavy calm crept over me; I fell asleep.    How long I remained in this state I know not, but when I woke I felt  perfectly restored. My eyes opened upon a group of silent forms, seated  around me in the gravity and quietude of Orientals--all more or less  like the first stranger; the same mantling wings, the same fashion of  garment, the same sphinx-like faces, with the deep dark eyes and red  man's colour; above all, the same type of race--race akin to man's, but  infinitely stronger of form and grandeur of aspect--and inspiring the  same unutterable feeling of dread. Yet each countenance was mild and  tranquil, and even kindly in expression. And, strangely enough, it  seemed to me that in this very calm and benignity consisted the secret  of the dread which the countenances inspired. They seemed as void of the  lines and shadows which care and sorrow, and passion and sin, leave upon  the faces of men, as are the faces of sculptured gods, or as, in the  eyes of Christian mourners, seem the peaceful brows of the dead.    I felt a warm hand on my shoulder; it was the child's. In his eyes there  was a sort of lofty pity and tenderness, such as that with which we may  gaze on some suffering bird or butterfly. I shrank from that touch--I  shrank from that eye. I was vaguely impressed with a belief that, had he  so pleased, that child could have killed me as easily as a man can kill  a bird or a butterfly. The child seemed pained at my repugnance, quitted  me, and placed himself beside one of the windows. The others continued  to converse with each other in a low tone, and by their glances towards  me I could perceive that I was the object of their conversation. One  in especial seemed to be urging some proposal affecting me on the being  whom I had first met, and this last by his gesture seemed about to  assent to it, when the child suddenly quitted his post by the window,  placed himself between me and the other forms, as if in protection, and  spoke quickly and eagerly. By some intuition or instinct I felt that  the child I had before so dreaded was pleading in my behalf. Ere he had  ceased another stranger entered the room. He appeared older than the  rest, though not old; his countenance less smoothly serene than theirs,  though equally regular in its features, seemed to me to have more the  touch of a humanity akin to my own. He listened quietly to the words  addressed to him, first by my guide, next by two others of the group,  and lastly by the child; then turned towards myself, and addressed  me, not by words, but by signs and gestures. These I fancied that I  perfectly understood, and I was not mistaken. I comprehended that he  inquired whence I came. I extended my arm, and pointed towards the road  which had led me from the chasm in the rock; then an idea seized me.  I drew forth my pocket-book, and sketched on one of its blank leaves a  rough design of the ledge of the rock, the rope, myself clinging to it;  then of the cavernous rock below, the head of the reptile, the lifeless  form of my friend. I gave this primitive kind of hieroglyph to my  interrogator, who, after inspecting it gravely, handed it to his next  neighbour, and it thus passed round the group. The being I had at first  encountered then said a few words, and the child, who approached and  looked at my drawing, nodded as if he comprehended its purport, and,  returning to the window, expanded the wings attached to his form, shook  them once or twice, and then launched himself into space without. I  started up in amaze and hastened to the window. The child was already in  the air, buoyed on his wings, which he did not flap to and fro as a  bird does, but which were elevated over his head, and seemed to bear him  steadily aloft without effort of his own. His flight seemed as swift  as an eagle's; and I observed that it was towards the rock whence I  had descended, of which the outline loomed visible in the brilliant  atmosphere. In a very few minutes he returned, skimming through the  opening from which he had gone, and dropping on the floor the rope and  grappling-hooks I had left at the descent from the chasm. Some words in  a low tone passed between the being present; one of the group touched an  automaton, which started forward and glided from the room; then the last  comer, who had addressed me by gestures, rose, took me by the hand,  and led me into the corridor. There the platform by which I had mounted  awaited us; we placed ourselves on it and were lowered into the hall  below. My new companion, still holding me by the hand, conducted me from  the building into a street (so to speak) that stretched beyond it, with  buildings on either side, separated from each other by gardens bright  with rich-coloured vegetation and strange flowers. Interspersed amidst  these gardens, which were divided from each other by low walls, or  walking slowly along the road, were many forms similar to those I had  already seen. Some of the passers-by, on observing me, approached my  guide, evidently by their tones, looks, and gestures addressing to him  inquiries about myself. In a few moments a crowd collected around us,  examining me with great interest, as if I were some rare wild animal.  Yet even in gratifying their curiosity they preserved a grave and  courteous demeanour; and after a few words from my guide, who seemed to  me to deprecate obstruction in our road, they fell back with a  stately inclination of head, and resumed their own way with tranquil  indifference. Midway in this thoroughfare we stopped at a building that  differed from those we had hitherto passed, inasmuch as it formed three  sides of a vast court, at the angles of which were lofty pyramidal  towers; in the open space between the sides was a circular fountain of  colossal dimensions, and throwing up a dazzling spray of what seemed to  me fire. We entered the building through an open doorway and came  into an enormous hall, in which were several groups of children, all  apparently employed in work as at some great factory. There was a huge  engine in the wall which was in full play, with wheels and cylinders  resembling our own steam-engines, except that it was richly ornamented  with precious stones and metals, and appeared to emanate a pale  phosphorescent atmosphere of shifting light. Many of the children were  at some mysterious work on this machinery, others were seated before  tables. I was not allowed to linger long enough to examine into the  nature of their employment. Not one young voice was heard--not one young  face turned to gaze on us. They were all still and indifferent as may  be ghosts, through the midst of which pass unnoticed the forms of the  living.    Quitting this hall, my guide led me through a gallery richly painted  in compartments, with a barbaric mixture of gold in the colours,  like pictures by Louis Cranach. The subjects described on these walls  appeared to my glance as intended to illustrate events in the history of  the race amidst which I was admitted. In all there were figures, most  of them like the manlike creatures I had seen, but not all in the same  fashion of garb, nor all with wings. There were also the effigies  of various animals and birds, wholly strange to me, with backgrounds  depicting landscapes or buildings. So far as my imperfect knowledge of  the pictorial art would allow me to form an opinion, these paintings  seemed very accurate in design and very rich in colouring, showing  a perfect knowledge of perspective, but their details not  arranged according to the rules of composition acknowledged by our  artists--wanting, as it were, a centre; so that the effect was vague,  scattered, confused, bewildering--they were like heterogeneous fragments  of a dream of art.    We now came into a room of moderate size, in which was assembled what I  afterwards knew to be the family of my guide, seated at a table spread  as for repast. The forms thus grouped were those of my guide's wife, his  daughter, and two sons. I recognised at once the difference between  the two sexes, though the two females were of taller stature and ampler  proportions than the males; and their countenances, if still more  symmetrical in outline and contour, were devoid of the softness and  timidity of expression which give charm to the face of woman as seen on  the earth above. The wife wore no wings, the daughter wore wings longer  than those of the males.    My guide uttered a few words, on which all the persons seated rose,  and with that peculiar mildness of look and manner which I have before  noticed, and which is, in truth, the common attribute of this formidable  race, they saluted me according to their fashion, which consists in  laying the right hand very gently on the head and uttering a soft  sibilant monosyllable--S.Si, equivalent to \"Welcome.\"    The mistress of the house then seated me beside her, and heaped a golden  platter before me from one of the dishes.    While I ate (and though the viands were new to me, I marvelled more  at the delicacy than the strangeness of their flavour), my companions  conversed quietly, and, so far as I could detect, with polite avoidance  of any direct reference to myself, or any obtrusive scrutiny of my  appearance. Yet I was the first creature of that variety of the human  race to which I belong that they had ever beheld, and was consequently  regarded by them as a most curious and abnormal phenomenon. But all  rudeness is unknown to this people, and the youngest child is taught to  despise any vehement emotional demonstration. When the meal was ended,  my guide again took me by the hand, and, re-entering the gallery,  touched a metallic plate inscribed with strange figures, and which I  rightly conjectured to be of the nature of our telegraphs.
