These are of modern origin. Wooden spoons (ja^{n}[t]ehe) were  made of knobs or knots of trees. Spoons made of buffalo horn are found  among the Omaha and Ponka, but the Osage, Kansa, and Kwapa use clam  shells ([t]ihaba, in [|C]egiha; tcuehaba, tcuehuba, in Kansa), so the  Kansa call a small spoon, tcuehaba jinga. Spoons of buffalo horn had  their handles variously ornamented by notches and other rude carving,  often terminating in the head of a bird, the neck or handle of each  being elevated at an angle of 50 deg. or 60 deg. with the bowl, which, was about  3 inches in width by about 5 in length. As the handle of such a spoon  usually terminates in a head or hook, it was impossible for it to slip  into the bowl when the hook rested on the outside of the rim of the  bowl.    Food was served in bowls of a very wide and simple form and of various  sizes, generally carved out of large knots of wood. These served as  drinking cups (ni[']i[|c]ata^{n}), but now cups of tin or earthenware  are used for that purpose.      Water Vessels    When pottery was made, they used bowls and kettles. Some used wooden  bowls of different sizes, the largest being about 2 feet in diameter.  When they went on the hunt, they used the inijeha (or sack made of the  muscular coating of the buffalo paunch, by filling with, grass to make  it stand out and keep its shape until dried). When the inijeha was  filled with water the mouth was tied, and it was kept covered and in the  shade that it might remain cool. After being used for a few days it  became strong smelling, and was thrown away, another taking its place.  Some preferred the \"[t]en[)a]n[']de uq[|c]a[']ha [|c]a^{n}\" or  pericardium(?) of the buffalo, which is like sinew. This does not smell  unpleasant, even when used for seven or ten days. But at the expiration  of that time it is unfit for further service.    Jugs have been introduced by the traders.      Other Vessels.    Provision sacks or parfleche cases were made of dried buffalo hide. When  used for carrying the dried meat, they were called weabasta. After two  or three years' use they became soft and were fit only for making  moccasin soles. These sacks had the hair taken off, and were sometimes  made in trunk fashion.    Fruit baskets were of three kinds. The Ponka made them of the bark of a  tree, called tawa[,]a^{n}he, which is found on the old Ponka reservation  in Dakota. Northern Indians make boats of this bark. The Omaha do not  find the tree on their land, so they make the fruit baskets of other  kinds of bark. The three kinds of baskets are as follows: Na^{n}[']pa  u[|c]is[)e], used for chokecherries; ag[|c]an[']kamange u[|c]is[)e],  used for raspberries; and bact u[|c]is[)e], used for strawberries. When  the Ponka wished to make the baskets, they stripped off the bark in  horizontal sections, not pulling upward or downward.    In modern times the Omaha have learned to make sacks of thread of  different colors drawn from black, red, blue, and white blankets.  Different figures are woven. Each sack is about a foot deep, 16 inches  from the mouth to the opposite side, and from 2 to 2-1/2 feet long. The  opening is on one of the long sides, and when the articles are put in a  gathering string is drawn and tied.      Hoes and Axes.    For hoes, the Omaha used the shoulder blades of the buffalo. Axes and  hatchets are now made of iron, hence, the Omaha name, ma^{n}[']ze-pe,  sharp iron. But the Kansa have the ancient name, ma^{n}[']hi-spe,  answering to the Dakota, wa^{n}hi^{n}[']-kpe, sharp flint. The hatchet  is distinguished from the ax by adding \"jinga,\" small. Some of the stone  axes and hatchets have been found on the Omaha reservation, but they  could hardly have been used for cutting. It is not known what tools were  used for felling trees.      Knives.    Knives were made of stone. A prominent butte, near the old Ponka agency,  Nebraska, is known as \"Mahi^{n}-[t]u,\" signifying blue knife, from the  character of the stone with which its surface is covered. It is several  miles from the mouth of Ponka creek and nearly opposite the month of  Choteau creek, South Dakota.      Implements Connected with Fire.    In former ages, the [|C]egiha made fire by rubbing or turning a stick  round and round between the hands. On the present Omaha reservation, and  in that region, the Omaha use elm roots for that purpose. In the country  called [P]izabahehe, near the source of Elkhorn river, there is a grass  known as \"duaduahi,\" which has about a hundred fine shoots from each  root, which is half the size of the head. The stalk was used for hand  drills and fire sticks. One stalk was cut almost flat, and the man puts  his feet on the ends to steady them. Then, holding the other stick in  his hands, with one end touching the stalk on the ground, he turned it  round and round till the friction produced fire. Sometimes a small  quantity of dry sand was placed on the flat stick. The same flat stick  answered for several occasions. When the cavity made by turning the hand  drill became too large, the point of contact was shifted to another part  of the flat stick, and so on until the whole of that stick was used,  when it was thrown away and another was obtained. Duaduahi, according to  Mr. Francis La Flesche, may be found in Judiciary square, Washington,  District of Columbia. After the coming of the white man, but before the  introduction of friction matches, which are now used by the whole tribe,  the Omaha used flints and tinder for making fire.    Spits for roasting, etc., naqpe, or webasna^{n}, were made of any kind  of wood.    For tongs they used the [p]edi[|c]a[|c]isande (\"fire-holder\"), made by  slitting one end of a stick. This implement was also called, ja^{n}  jinga nini ibista (\"the stick that presses the fire against the  tobacco\"), because it was used for lighting pipes.      Smoking Paraphernalia.    [Illustration: Fig. 315.--Omaha calumet]    The pipes in use among the Omaha are of three kinds: the sacred pipe  (niniba waqube, mysterious pipe), including the war pipes and those used  by the chiefs in making peace; the niniba weawa^{n} or calumet  (illustrated in figure 315), used in the calumet dance or dance of  adoption,[1] and the hatchet pipe or ma^{n}zepe niniba, introduced since  the coming of the white man. One form of the pipe used on ordinary  Tobacco pouches (niniujiha) were made of deer or antelope skin, and  were ornamented with porcupine quills or a fringe of deerskin. Sometimes  buffalo bladders were used for this purpose. The women used them as  receptacles for their porcupine quills.    [Footnote 1: See \"Omaha Sociology,\" Third Ann. Rept. Bur. Ethnology,  chap. vi.]    occasions is shown in figure 316. This pipe has a bowl of catlinite, and  the stem is decorated with horsehair.    [Illustration: Fig. 316.--Omaha pipe used on ordinary  occasions.]      Equipage for Horses.    Saddles (canakag[|c]e) were in use before the coming of the whites. They  were made of wood, around which was wrapped hide, while still  \"[t]aha-nu[k]a\" (green or soft). According to Joseph La Fleche these  saddles did not rub sores on the backs of the native horses (Indian  ponies), but Dougherty[1] said, in 1819, \"The Indians are generally  cruel horse-masters, perhaps in a great measure through necessity; the  backs of their horses are very often sore and ulcerated, from the  friction of the rude saddle, which is fashioned after the Spanish  manner, being elevated at the pummel and croup, and resting on skin  saddle cloths without padding.\" They ride very well, and make frequent  use of the whip and their heels, the latter being employed instead of  spurs.    For bridles and halters they used strips of hide, out of which material  they made also lariats. The bridle used consisted of a withe, one end of  which was wrapped two or three times around the animal's lower jaw,  while the other was held in the hand, forming but a single rein. This  did not hinder the rider from guiding his horse, as he was able to turn  him to the left by pressing the single rein against the animal's neck,  as well as by the use of the right heel against its side. When he wished  to turn to the right, he pulled the rein and pressed his left heel  against the horse's side.    Whips were of three kinds. The wahi wegasapi was attached to a bone  handle. The handle of a ja^{u}[']uke[|c]i^{n} wegasapi was made of  common wood. That of a za^{n}zi wegasapi was made of Osage orange wood,  which is very hard. The whip was attached to the wrist by a broad band,  which passed through a hole near the end of the handle. The handle was  about 15 inches long and was very stout. A specimen that has been  deposited in the National Museum (a gift to the author from an Omaha)  has a lash 2 feet long, composed of 8 thongs one-fifth of an inch wide.  These are plaited together in one rounded plait for 18 inches, the rest  of the lash being in 2 plaits of 4 thongs each, knotted near the ends.    The lasso was called ma^{n}[']tanah-i[|c]ize, i.e., \"that by which (a)  wild (horse) is taken.\" It was made by taking the hair from the head of  a buffalo and plaiting it into a very strong rope as thick as one's  thumb. This rope was called \"[t]aha-[|c]isa^{n},\" and was utilized by  the Omaha and Ponka instead of the common lasso for catching wild horses  in northwestern Nebraska. One end of the rope was formed into a noose  large enough to slip over a horse's head, and the ends of this noose  were secured to a long pole by small cords. The other end of the rope,  arranged in a coil, was fastened to the belt or waist of the man. He  rode with the pole held in one hand and tried to thrust the noose in  front of a horse. When he succeeded in passing the noose over the head  of an animal, he threw away the stick, which had become separated from  the noose, and held the rope alone, which he pulled toward him. When the  horse was caught, the "]]]
