[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20248"],[0,"The Necessity of Atheism (#3)"],[1,"  Upon falling asleep he dreams, and awakening, he finds that he is still  in the same place where he had lain the night before. Yet, he is certain  that during the night he had traveled to his favorite wood and killed an  animal whose tender flesh he was still savoring. Since the conception  of a dream was as yet foreign to him, the logical conclusion he arrived  at was that he had both a body and a spirit. If he possessed a body and  a spirit, then all things about him, he reasoned, must likewise possess  a similar spirit. Some spirits, he felt, were friendly; some, hostile to  him. The hostile spirits were to be feared; but that powerful factor,  \"hope,\" had at last entered into his mind, and he hoped to be able to  win them over to the camp of friendly spirits.    In this manner, man passed from the stage of contending against the  spirits to one of placating them. It was believed that certain men  carried more favor with the spirits than others, and these became the  original priests, called the \"Shamans.\"    Another expedient for warding off evil spirits was by means of the  fetish. The primitive fetish was an object containing an active friendly  spirit, which, if worn by the individual, protected him from the evil  spirits. In a short while the manufacture of fetishes became a sacred  profession, and the men who were thought to fashion the best ones became  the professional holy men of the period, the priests.    At first, idols were used to drive away the evil spirits, and then, the  conception changed to one of attracting the good spirits to man. From  the individual fetish man passed to tribal ones, which in their first  form were huge boulders and trees.    As the primitive mind gained cunning, it slyly smeared the surface of  the idol with oily substances, hoping that the spirit, like some wild  beast, would come and lick, be gratified, and remain in the idol. When  some favorable signs denoted that a good spirit had entered into the  idol, it was regularly smeared with oils and then blood, in the hope  that the spirit would be pleased sufficiently to remain there  permanently. As time went on, it became a custom, a rite, and the  spirit having performed to the satisfaction of the tribe, ways were  invented to manifest their gratitude. Instead of smearing the idol with  blood, it was thought more fitting that an animal be killed and offered  to the good spirit contained within the idol. In this manner arose the  beginning of \"sacrifice.\" It was at this time, when man began to  persuade the idols or spirits to do things for his benefit that religion  began.    Slowly, slowly, down through the ages, as the mind of man progressed,  his self-made religious conceptions advanced. He now worshiped idols,  and these idols were his gods. The Celts, the Babylonians, the Greeks,  the Romans, all had their idols. All were certain that their gods were  the true ones, and that the others were all inferior and even false  gods. But, is the modern worshipper who is contemptuous of the ancients  very different from them?    The centuries pass by, and in their wake is man's self-conceived  religion. Now, some men take the prerogative in the manufacture of  religion, and there evolve Brahmanism, Jainism, Buddhism, Hinduism,  Confucianism, Taoism, and Zoroastrianism, all inspired, all  supernatural, and with their myriads of followers who believed and still  believe that theirs is the only true creed.    Very recently, in the time-scale of our development, man adopted the  methods of \"Big Business,\" and the religion of many gods and idols,  polytheism, has given way to one Supreme God, monotheism. Man found that  it made for simplicity and saved his valuable time if he worshiped one  god, instead of obeying the hitherto many. The \"Chosen People\" took it  upon themselves to bring the next divinely concocted conception of a  Supreme God, and they manufactured the creed of Judaism.    After many years, a rift arose among the Jews, and the sectarians were  defeated and expelled. Foiled in their first object, they cast aside  the laws of Moses and offered the Hebrew religion without the Hebrew  ceremonies to the Greek and Roman world. Jesus was the man who prepared  the way for this remarkable event.    When Mohammed conceived the divine conception that he would follow in  the footsteps of his brother-prophets, Moses and Jesus, the latest of  the major religions was revealed.    At the present time, the Hebrews and Christians, although worshiping the  same Jehovah, are disputing with each other, and indeed, amongst  themselves, with regard to the various attributes, amorous pursuits, and  lineal descendants of the Godhead. Jehovah himself appears to be on the  decline and his unity is steadily disintegrating into a paradoxical  trinity. But we are progressing, for in 1300 years no new prophet has  arisen, and no new divine revelation is perturbing our race; the old  ones, however, are causing quite enough disturbance.    It would be of value for the modern religionist who believes that the  worship of a deity in our own age is far removed from the worship of an  idol by our savage ancestors, to retrace his steps and compare the  savage mind worshiping his particular idol and a so-called civilized  mind of today worshiping his deity.    The savage prayed to his idol, that is, he _begged_. He begged the idol  to watch over his flock or his fields. The modern prays, that is he begs  of his idol, his deity, to prosper his business, to guard his life, and,  as one of my \"super-devout\" acquaintances recently informed me, on the  eve of an important golf match, for the Deity to give him endurance; in  other words, \"to cut down his golf score.\"    The savage voiced his incantations; the modern sings hymns, that is he  flatters. There is still a great deal of the charlatanry of the magician  in the construction of the houses of prayer, with the sunlight shut out  and only filtering through the leaded and multi-colored panes, the  semidarkness, the solemnity, the rise and swell of the organ; all things  combined to overcome the senses, to play upon the emotions, and to  subdue the reason.    The savage made sacrifices to his idols, that is, he paid tribute,  chiefly out of fear, but partly in the hope of getting something better  in return. The modern does not offer human or animal sacrifice, it is  true; but it must be borne in mind that the wealth of the savage  consisted of his sheep, oxen, oils, and wines, not money. Today, the  devout offer a sacrifice of money to the Deity. We are all familiar with  the requests of religious institutions for gifts, which nearly always  finish with the phrase, \"And the Lord will repay you many fold.\" In  other words, sacrifice part of your worldly goods to the idol, and he  will repay with high interest. He will give in return long life and much  riches. The savage was afraid to utter the real name of his god, it was  taboo. The modern says, \"Take not the name of the Lord in vain.\" Even  today, the followers of Moses consider it taboo to utter the name of  Jehovah except in prayer.    The present-day methods of worship are no different from those of the  savage; the method of supplication has changed with the advance of the  years, but the fundamental ideas at the base of all worship are just as  crude today as they were 4000 years ago. Primitive man was no more a  fetishist than is the modern Catholic. The latter still wears medals and  images suspended from the neck and pinned to the inner clothing.    Moreover, a survey of the various religions extant indicates that the  religious factor is no less prevalent today than it was in primitive  societies.    In Greenland, one finds, that through nearly all of its vast area  religion has no place, but that is chiefly the result of its being  largely uninhabited. In Alaska, the population is for the most part  Catholic, although the natives are animists. In Canada, 33 per cent are  Catholic, the rest are mainly Protestant. In the United States, 20 per  cent are Catholic, 3.5 per cent are Jewish, and the remainder are  Protestants. Mexico, Central and South America, are almost entirely  Roman Catholic. In Europe, Russia was until recently dominantly Greek  Orthodox; the Scandinavian peninsula, the English Isles, and Central  Europe are dominantly Protestant, while France, Portugal, Spain, Italy,  and the rest of the countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea are  Catholic. The rest of the continent is divided between Jews and  Mohammedans. In Asia, the entire vast area of Siberia is only sparsely  settled and its religions include Animism, Taoism, and Christianity. In  China, we find the land of three truths, Confucianism, Taoism, and  Buddhism. India, Tibet, and Burma are dominated by Hinduism and  Buddhism; Arabia, Persia, and the rest of the continent are Mohammedan.  In Japan, there are the Shintoists. The East Indies, where the  population is native, are Animistic. In Australia, the dominant religion  is Protestantism. In North Africa, the west coast inhabitants are  Mohammedans, while the Abyssinians are Christians. There are some Coptic  Christians, in Egypt, while in the Congo and South African countries  down to the Cape Settlements, the natives are Animists. The Cape  Settlements themselves are Protestants.    More concretely, it is estimated that 10.7% of the inhabitants of the  globe are Protestants; 16.2% are Catholics; 7.1% are Greek Orthodox; 10%  are Animists; 1.4% are Shintoists; 18.2% are Confucians and Taoists;  12.8% are Hindus; 8.4% are Buddhists; 13.4% are Moslems; and 1.8% are  Hebrews and unclassified sects. Truly, a religious babel! and 10% of all  the inhabitants of the globe, about the same number of people who  profess to Protestantism, are Animists. This is the lowest stage of  primitive religion, and millions of humans are still quagmired in the  sloth of a primitive faith which once must have been the faith of all"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2028"],[0,"The Yellow Claw (#3)"],[1,"ally. \"I CANNOT  explain! If I could explain, I\"...    \"Leroux!\" said Cumberly, placing his arm paternally about the shaking  man--\"you are such a nervous subject. DO make an effort, old fellow.  Pull yourself together. Exel does not know the circumstances--\"    \"I am curious to learn them,\" said the M. P. icily.    Leroux was about to launch some angry retort, but Cumberly forced him  into the chesterfield, and crossing to a bureau, poured out a stiff  peg of brandy from a decanter which stood there. Leroux sank upon the  chesterfield, rubbing his fingers up and down his palms with a  curious nervous movement and glancing at the dead woman, and at Exel,  alternately, in a mechanical, regular fashion, pathetic to behold.    Mr. Exel, tapping his boot with the head of his inverted cane, was  staring fixedly at the doctor.    \"Here you are, Leroux,\" said Cumberly; \"drink this up, and let us  arrange our facts in decent order before we--\"    \"Phone for the police?\" concluded Exel, his gaze upon the last speaker.    Leroux drank the brandy at a gulp and put down the glass upon a little  persian coffee table with a hand which he had somehow contrived to  steady.    \"You are keen on the official forms, Exel?\" he said, with a wry smile.  \"Please accept my apology for my recent--er--outburst, but picture this  thing happening in your place!\"    \"I cannot,\" declared Exel, bluntly.    \"You lack imagination,\" said Cumberly. \"Take a whisky and soda, and help  me to search the flat.\"    \"Search the flat!\"    The physician raised a forefinger, forensically.    \"Since you, Exel, if not actually in the building, must certainly have  been within sight of the street entrance at the moment of the crime, and  since Leroux and I descended the stair and met you on the landing, it is  reasonable to suppose that the assassin can only be in one place: HERE!\"    \"HERE!\" cried Exel and Leroux, together.    \"Did you see anyone leave the lower hall as you entered?\"    \"No one; emphatically, there was no one there!\"    \"Then I am right.\"    \"Good God!\" whispered Exel, glancing about him, with a new, and keen  apprehensiveness.    \"Take your drink,\" concluded Cumberly, \"and join me in my search.\"    \"Thanks,\" replied Exel, nervously proffering a cigar-case; \"but I won't  drink.\"    \"As you wish,\" said the doctor, who thus, in his masterful way, acted  the host; \"and I won't smoke. But do you light up.\"    \"Later,\" muttered Exel; \"later. Let us search, first.\"    Leroux stood up; Cumberly forced him back.    \"Stay where you are, Leroux; it is elementary strategy to operate from a  fixed base. This study shall be the base. Ready, Exel?\"    Exel nodded, and the search commenced. Leroux sat rigidly upon the  settee, his hands resting upon his knees, watching and listening. Save  for the merry ticking of the table-clock, and the movements of the  searchers from room to room, nothing disturbed the silence. From the  table, and that which lay near to it, he kept his gaze obstinately  averted.    Five or six minutes passed in this fashion, Leroux expecting each to  bring a sudden outcry. He was disappointed. The searchers returned, Exel  noticeably holding himself aloof and Cumberly very stern.    Exel, a cigar between his teeth, walked to the writing-table, carefully  circling around the dreadful obstacle which lay in his path, to help  himself to a match. As he stooped to do so, he perceived that in the  closed right hand of the dead woman was a torn scrap of paper.    \"Leroux! Cumberly!\" he exclaimed; \"come here!\"    He pointed with the match as Cumberly hurriedly crossed to his side.  Leroux, inert, remained where he sat, but watched with haggard eyes. Dr.  Cumberly bent down and sought to detach the paper from the grip of the  poor cold fingers, without tearing it. Finally he contrived to release  the fragment, and, perceiving it to bear some written words, he spread  it out beneath the lamp, on the table, and eagerly scanned it, lowering  his massive gray head close to the writing.    He inhaled, sibilantly.    \"Do you see, Exel?\" he jerked--for Exel was bending over his shoulder.    \"I do--but I don't understand.\"    \"What is it?\" came hollowly from Leroux.    \"It is the bottom part of an unfinished note,\" said Cumberly, slowly.  \"It is written shakily in a woman's hand, and it reads:--'Your wife'\"...    Leroux sprang to his feet and crossed the room in three strides.    \"Wife!\" he muttered. His voice seemed to be choked in his throat; \"my  wife! It says something about my wife?\"    \"It says,\" resumed the doctor, quietly, \"'your wife.' Then there's a  piece torn out, and the two words 'Mr. King.' No stop follows, and the  line is evidently incomplete.\"    \"My wife!\" mumbled Leroux, staring unseeingly at the fragment of paper.  \"MY WIFE! MR. KING! Oh! God! I shall go mad!\"    \"Sit down!\" snapped Dr. Cumberly, turning to him; \"damn it, Leroux, you  are worse than a woman!\"    In a manner almost childlike, the novelist obeyed the will of the  stronger man, throwing himself into an armchair, and burying his face in  his hands.    \"My wife!\" he kept muttering--\"my wife!\"...    Exel and the doctor stood staring at one another; when suddenly, from  outside the flat, came a metallic clattering, followed by a little  suppressed cry. Helen Cumberly, in daintiest deshabille, appeared in  the lobby, carrying, in one hand, a chafing-dish, and, in the other,  the lid. As she advanced toward the study, from whence she had heard her  father's voice:--    \"Why, Mr. Leroux!\" she cried, \"I shall CERTAINLY report you to Mira,  now! You have not even touched the omelette!\"    \"Good God! Cumberly! stop her!\" muttered Exel, uneasily. \"The door was  not latched!\"...    But it was too late. Even as the physician turned to intercept his  daughter, she crossed the threshold of the study. She stopped short  at perceiving Exel; then, with a woman's unerring intuition, divined a  tragedy, and, in the instant of divination, sought for, and found, the  hub of the tragic wheel.    One swift glance she cast at the fur-clad form, prostrate.    The chafing-dish fell from her hand, and the omelette rolled, a  grotesque mass, upon the carpet. She swayed, dizzily, raising one hand  to her brow, but had recovered herself even as Leroux sprang forward to  support her.    \"All right, Leroux!\" cried Cumberly; \"I will take her upstairs again.  Wait for me, Exel.\"    Exel nodded, lighted his cigar, and sat down in a chair, remote from the  writing-table.    \"Mira--my wife!\" muttered Leroux, standing, looking after Dr. Cumberly  and his daughter as they crossed the lobby. \"She will report to--my  wife.\"...    In the outer doorway, Helen Cumberly looked back over her shoulder,  and her glance met that of Leroux. Hers was a healing glance and a  strengthening glance; it braced him up as nothing else could have done.  He turned to Exel.    \"For Heaven's sake, Exel!\" he said, evenly, \"give me your advice--give  me your help; I am going to 'phone for the police.\"    Exel looked up with an odd expression.    \"I am entirely at your service, Leroux,\" he said. \"I can quite  understand how this ghastly affair has shaken you up.\"    \"It was so sudden,\" said the other, plaintively. \"It is incredible  that so much emotion can be crowded into so short a period of a man's  life.\"...    Big Ben chimed the quarter after midnight. Leroux, eyes averted, walked  to the writing-table, and took up the telephone.          III    INSPECTOR DUNBAR TAKES CHARGE      Detective-Inspector Dunbar was admitted by Dr. Cumberly. He was a man of  notable height, large-boned, and built gauntly and squarely. His clothes  fitted him ill, and through them one seemed to perceive the massive  scaffolding of his frame. He had gray hair retiring above a high  brow, but worn long and untidily at the back; a wire-like straight-cut  mustache, also streaked with gray, which served to accentuate the  grimness of his mouth and slightly undershot jaw. A massive head, with  tawny, leonine eyes; indeed, altogether a leonine face, and a frame  indicative of tremendous nervous energy.    In the entrance lobby he stood for a moment.    \"My name is Cumberly,\" said the doctor, glancing at the card which the  Scotland Yard man had proffered. \"I occupy the flat above.\"    \"Glad to know you, Dr. Cumberly,\" replied the detective in a light and  not unpleasant voice--and the fierce eyes momentarily grew kindly.    \"This--\" continued Cumberly, drawing Dunbar forward into the study, \"is  my friend, Leroux--Henry Leroux, whose name you will know?\"    \"I have not that pleasure,\" replied Dunbar.    \"Well,\" added Cumberly, \"he is a famous novelist, and his flat,  unfortunately, has been made the scene of a crime. This is  Detective-Inspector Dunbar, who has come to solve our difficulties,  Leroux.\" He turned to where Exel stood upon the hearth-rug--toying with  his monocle. \"Mr. John Exel, M. P.\"    \"Glad to know you, gentlemen,\" said Dunbar.    Leroux rose from the armchair in which he had been sitting and stared,  drearily, at the newcomer. Exel screwed the monocle into his right eye,  and likewise surveyed the detective. Cumberly, taking a tumbler from the  bureau, said:--    \"A scotch-and-soda, Inspector?\"    \"It is a suggestion,\" said Dunbar, \"that, coming from a medical man,  appeals.\"    Whilst the doctor poured out the whisky and squirted the soda into the  glass, Inspector Dunbar, standing squarely in the middle of the  room, fixed his eyes upon the still form lying in the shadow of the  writing-table.    \"You will have been called in, doctor,\" he said, taking the proffered  tumbler, \"at the time of the crime?\"    \"Exactly!\" replied Cumberly. \"Mr. Leroux ran up to my flat and summoned  me to see the woman.\"    \"What time would that be?\"    \"Big Ben had just struck the final stroke of twelve when I came out on  to the landing.\"    \"Mr. Leroux would be waiting there for you?\"    \"He stood in my entrance-lobby whilst I slipped on my dressing-gow"]]]
