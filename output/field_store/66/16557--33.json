With a hulla-buloo,        Hail a big kangaroo--    But be sure that your weight she'll sustain--        Then with hop, and with skip,        She will take you a trip    With the speed of the very best steed;    And, this is a truth for which I can vouch,    There's no carriage can equal a kangaroo's pouch.    Oh! where is a friend so strong and true    As a dear big, bounding kangaroo?          \"Good bye! Good bye!\"        The lizards all cry,    Each drying its eyes with its tail.        \"Adieu! Adieu!        Dear kangaroo!\"    The scared little grasshoppers wail.        \"They're going express        To a distant address,\"    Says the bandicoot, ready to scoot;    And your path is well cleared for your progress, I vouch,    When you ride through the bush in a kangaroo's pouch.    Oh! where is a friend so strong and true    As a dear big, bounding kangaroo?          \"Away and away!\"        You will certainly say,    \"To the end of the farthest blue--        To the verge of the sky,        And the far hills high,    O take me with thee, kangaroo!        We will seek for the end,        Where the broad plains tend,    E'en as far as the evening star.    Why, the end of the world we can reach, I vouch,    Dear kangaroo, with me in your pouch.\"    Oh! where is a friend so strong and true    As a dear big, bounding kangaroo?          CHAPTER II      \"That is a nice song of yours,\" said the Kangaroo, \"and I like it very  much, but please stop singing now, as we are getting near the water-hole,  for it's not etiquette to make a noise near water at sundown.\"    Dot would have asked why everything must be so quiet; but as she peeped  out, she saw that the Kangaroo was making a very dangerous descent, and  she did not like to trouble her friend with questions just then. They  seemed to be going down to a great deep gully that looked almost like a  hole in the earth, the depth was so great, and the hills around came so  closely together. The way the Kangaroo was hopping was like going down  the side of a wall. Huge rocks were tumbled about here and there. Some  looked as if they would come rolling down upon them; and others appeared  as if a little jolt would send them crashing and tumbling into the  darkness below. Where the Kangaroo found room to land on its feet after  each bound puzzled Dot, for there seemed no foothold anywhere. It all  looked so dangerous to the little girl that she shut her eyes, so as not  to see the terrible places they bounded over, or rested on: she felt  sure that the Kangaroo must lose her balance, or hop just a little too  far or a little too near, and that they would fall together over the  side of that terrible wild cliff. At last she said:    \"Oh, Kangaroo, shall we get safely to the bottom do you think?\"    \"I never think,\" said the Kangaroo, \"but I know we shall. This is the  easiest way. If I went through the thick bush on the other side, I  should stand a chance of running my head against a tree at every leap,  unless I got a stiff neck with holding my head on one side looking out  of one eye all the time. My nose gets in the way when I look straight in  front,\" she explained. \"Don't be afraid,\" she continued. \"I know every  jump of the way. We kangaroos have gone this way ever since Australia  began to have kangaroos. Look here!\" she said, pausing on a big boulder  that hung right over the gully, \"we have made a history book for  ourselves out of these rocks; and so long as these rocks last, long,  long after the time when there will be no more kangaroos, and no more  humans, the sun, and the moon, and the stars will look down upon what  we have traced on these stones.\"    Dot peered out from her little refuge in the Kangaroo's pouch, and  saw the glow of the twilight sky reflected on the top of the boulder.  The rough surface of the stone shone with a beautiful polish like a  looking-glass, for the rock had been rubbed for thousands of years by  the soft feet and tails of millions of kangaroos; kangaroos that had  hopped down that way to get water. When Dot saw that, she didn't know  why it all seemed solemn, or why she felt such a very little girl. She  was a little sad, and the Kangaroo, after a short sigh, continued her  way.    As they neared the bottom of the gully the Kangaroo became extremely  cautious. She no longer hopped in the open, but made her way with little  leaps through the thick scrub. She peeped out carefully before each  movement. Her long, soft ears kept moving to catch every sound, and her  black sensitive little nose was constantly lifted, sniffing the air.  Every now and then she gave little backward starts, as if she were going  to retreat by the way she had come, and Dot, with her face pressed  against the Kangaroo's soft furry coat, could hear her heart beating so  fast that she knew she was very frightened.    They were not alone. Dot could hear whispers from unseen little  creatures everywhere in the scrub, and from birds in the trees. High up  in the branches were numbers of pigeons--sweet little Bronze-Wings; and  above all the other sounds she could hear their plaintive voices crying,  \"We're so frightened! we're so frightened! so thirsty and so frightened!  so thirsty and so frightened!\"    \"Why don't they drink at the water-hole?\" whispered Dot.    \"Because they're frightened,\" was the answer.    \"Frightened of what?\" asked Dot.    \"Humans!\" said the Kangaroo, in frightened tones; and as she spoke she  reared up upon her long legs and tail, so that she stood at least six  feet high, and peeped over the bushes; her nose working all round, and  her ears wagging.    \"I think it's safe,\" she said, as she squatted down again.    \"Friend Kangaroo,\" said a Bronze-Wing that had sidled out to the end  of a neighbouring branch, \"you are so courageous, will you go first to  the water, and let us know if it is all safe? We haven't tasted a drop  of water for two days,\" she said, sadly, \"and we're dying of thirst.  Last night, when we had waited for hours, to make certain there were  no cruel Humans about, we flew down for a drink--and we wanted, oh! so  little, just three little sips; but the terrible Humans, with their  'bang-bangs,' murdered numbers of us. Then we flew back, and some were  hurt and bleeding, and died of their wounds, and none of us have dared  to get a drink since.\" Dot could see that the poor pigeon was suffering  great thirst, for its wings were drooping, and its poor dry beak was  open.    The Kangaroo was very distressed at hearing the pigeon's story. \"It is  dreadful for you pigeons,\" she said, \"because you can only drink at  evening; we sometimes can quench our thirst in the day, I wish we could  do without water! The Humans know all the water-holes, and sooner or  later we all get murdered, or die of thirst. How cruel they are!\"    Still the pigeons cried on, \"we're so thirsty and so frightened;\" and  the Bronze-Wing asked the Kangaroo to try again, if she could either  smell or hear a Human near the water-hole.    \"I think we are safe,\" said the Kangaroo, having sniffed and listened as  before; \"I will now try a nearer view.\"    The news soon spread that the Kangaroo was going to venture near the  water, to see if all was safe. The light was very dim, and there was a  general whisper that the attempt to get a drink of water should not be  left later; as some feared such foes as dingoes and night birds, should  they venture into the open space at night. As the Kangaroo moved  stealthily forward, pushing aside the branches of the scrub, or standing  erect to peep here and there, there was absolute silence in the bush.  Even the pigeons ceased to say they were afraid, but hopped silently  from bough to bough, following the movements of the Kangaroo with eager  little eyes. The Brush Turkey and the Mound-Builder left their heaped-up  nests and joined the other thirsty creatures, and only by the crackling  of the dry scrub, or the falling of a few leaves, could one tell that so  many live creatures were together in that wild place.    Presently the Kangaroo had reached the last bushes of the scrub, behind  which she crouched.    \"There's not a smell or a sound,\" she said. \"Get out, Dot, and wait here  until I return, and the Bronze-Wings have had their drink; for, did they  see you, they would be too frightened to come down, and would have to  wait another night and day.\"    Dot got out of the pouch, and she was very sorry when she saw how  terrified her friend looked. She could see the fur on the Kangaroo's  chest moving with the frightened beating of her heart; and her beautiful  brown eyes looked wild and strange with fear.    Instantly, the Kangaroo leaped into the open. For a second she paused  erect, sniffing and listening, and then she hastened to the water. As  she stooped to drink, Dot heard a \"whrr, whrr, whrr,\" and, like falling  leaves, down swept the Bronze-Wings. It was a wonderful sight. The  water-hole shone in the dim light, with the great black darkness of the  trees surrounding it, and from all parts came the thirsty creatures of  the bush. The Bronze-Wings were all together. Hundred of little heads  bobbed by the edge of the pool, as the little bills were filled, and  the precious water was swallowed; then, together, a minute afterwards,  \"whrr, whrr, whrr,\" up they flew, and in one great sweeping circle  they regained their tree-tops. Like the bush creatures, Dot also was  frightened, and running to the water, hurriedly drank, and fled back  to the shelter of the bush, where the Kangaroo was waiting for her.    \"Jump in!\" said the Kangaroo, \"It's never safe by the water,\" and, a  minute after, Dot was again in the cosy pouch, and was hurrying away,  like all the others from the water where men are wont to camp, and kill  with their guns the poor creatures that come "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18900"],[0,"A Text-Book of the History of Painting (#3)"],[1," truth. The color was usually an attempt at  nature, though at times arbitrary or symbolic, as in the case of  certain gods rendered with blue, yellow, or green skins. The  backgrounds were always of flat color, arbitrary in hue, and  decorative only. The only composition was a balance by numbers, and  the processional scenes rose tier upon tier above one another in long  panels.    [Illustration: FIG. 3.--OFFERINGS TO THE DEAD, WALL PAINTING, EIGHTEENTH  DYNASTY. (FROM PERROT AND CHIPIEZ.)]    Such work would seem almost ludicrous did we not keep in mind its  reason for existence. It was, first, symbolic story-telling art, and  secondly, architectural decoration. As a story-teller it was effective  because of its simplicity and directness. As decoration, the repeated  expressionless face and figure, the arbitrary color, the absence of  perspective were not inappropriate then nor are they now. Egyptian  painting never was free from the decorative motive. Wall painting was  little more than an adjunct of architecture, and probably grew out of  sculpture. The early statues were colored, and on the wall the chisel,  like the flint of Primitive Man, cut the outline of the figure. At  first only this cut was filled with color, producing what has been  called the koil-anaglyphic. In the final stage the line was made by  drawing with chalk or coal on prepared stucco, and the color, mixed  with gum-water (a kind of distemper), was applied to the whole  enclosed space. Substantially the same method of painting was used  upon other materials, such as wood, mummy cartonnage, papyrus; and in  all its thousands of years of existence Egyptian painting never  advanced upon or varied to any extent this one method of work.    HISTORIC PERIODS: Egyptian art may be traced back as far as the Third  or Fourth Memphitic dynasty of kings. The date is uncertain, but it is  somewhere near 3,500 B.C. The seat of empire, at that time, was  located at Memphis in Lower Egypt, and it is among the remains of this    Memphitic Period that the earliest and best painting is found. In  fact, all Egyptian art, literature, language, civilization, seem at  their highest point of perfection in the period farthest removed from  us. In that earliest age the finest portrait busts were cut, and the  painting, found chiefly in the tombs and on the mummy-cases, was the  attempted realistic with not a little of spirited individuality. The  figure was rather short and squat, the face a little squarer than the  conventional type afterward adopted, the action better, and the  positions, attitudes, and gestures more truthful to local  characteristics. The domestic scenes--hunting, fishing, tilling,  grazing--were all shown in the one flat, planeless, shadowless method  of representation, but with better drawing and color and more variety  than appeared later on. Still, more or less conventional types were  used, even in this early time, and continued to be used all through  Egyptian history.    [Illustration: FIG. 4.--VIGNETTE ON PAPYRUS, LOUVRE. (FROM PERROT AND  CHIPIEZ.)]    The Memphitic Period comes down to the eleventh dynasty. In the  fifteenth dynasty comes the invasion of the so-called Hyksos, or  Shepherd Kings. Little is known of the Hyksos, and, in painting, the  next stage is the    Theban Period, which, culminated in Thebes, in Upper Egypt, with  Rameses II., of the nineteenth dynasty. Painting had then changed  somewhat both in subject and character. The time was one of great  temple and palace building, and, though the painting of _genre_  subjects in tombs and sepulchres continued, the general body of art  became more monumental and subservient to architecture. Painting was  put to work on temple and palace-walls, depicting processional scenes,  either religious or monarchical, and vast in extent. The figure, too,  changed slightly. It became longer, slighter, with a pronounced nose,  thick lips, and long eye. From constant repetition, rather than any  set rule or canon, this figure grew conventional, and was reproduced  as a type in a mechanical and unvarying manner for hundreds of years.  It was, in fact, only a variation from the original Egyptian type seen  in the tombs of the earliest dynasties. There was a great quantity of  art produced during the Theban Period, and of a graceful, decorative  character, but it was rather monotonous by repetition and filled with  established mannerisms. The Egyptian really never was a free worker,  never an artist expressing himself; but, for his day, a skilled  mechanic following time-honored example. In the    Saitic Period the seat of empire was once more in Lower Egypt, and art  had visibly declined with the waning power of the country. All  spontaneity seemed to have passed out of it, it was repetition of  repetition by poor workmen, and the simplicity and purity of the  technic were corrupted by foreign influences. With the Alexandrian  epoch Egyptian art came in contact with Greek methods, and grew  imitative of the new art, to the detriment of its own native  character. Eventually it was entirely lost in the art of the  Greco-Roman world. It was never other than conventional, produced by a  method almost as unvarying as that of the hieroglyphic writing, and in  this very respect characteristic and reflective of the unchanging  Orientals. Technically it had its shortcomings, but it conveyed the  proper information to its beholders and was serviceable and graceful  decoration for Egyptian days.         EXTANT PAINTINGS: The temples, palaces, and tombs of Egypt       still reveal Egyptian painting in almost as perfect a state       as when originally executed; the Ghizeh Museum has many fine       examples; and there are numerous examples in the museums at       Turin, Paris, Berlin, London, New York, and Boston. An       interesting collection belongs to the New York Historical       Society, and some of the latest \"finds\" of the Egypt       Exploration Fund are in the Boston Museum.

TIGRIS-EUPHRATES CIVILIZATION: In many respects the civilization along  the Tigris-Euphrates was like that along the Nile. Both valleys were  settled by primitive peoples, who grew rapidly by virtue of favorable  climate and soil, and eventually developed into great nations headed  by kings absolute in power. The king was the state in Egypt, and in  Assyria the monarch was even more dominant and absolute. For the  Pharaohs shared architecture, painting, and sculpture with the gods;  but the Sargonids seem to have arrogated the most of these things to  themselves alone.    Religion was perhaps as real in Assyria as in Egypt, but it was less  apparent in art. Certain genii, called gods or demons, appear in the  bas-reliefs, but it is not yet settled whether they represent gods or  merely legendary heroes or monsters of fable. There was no great  demonstration of religion by form and color, as in Egypt. The  Assyrians were Semites, and religion with them was more a matter of  the spirit than the senses--an image in the mind rather than an image  in metal or stone. The temple was not eloquent with the actions and  deeds of the gods, and even the tomb, that fruitful source of art in  Egypt, was in Chaldaea undecorated and in Assyria unknown. No one knows  what the Assyrians did with their dead, unless they carried them back  to the fatherland of the race, the Persian Gulf region, as the native  tribes of Mesopotamia do to this day.    ART MOTIVES: As in Egypt, there were two motives for art--illustration  and decoration. Religion, as we have seen, hardly obtained at all. The  king attracted the greatest attention. The countless bas-reliefs, cut  on soft stone slabs, were pages from the history of the monarch in  peace and war, in council, in the chase, or in processional rites.  Beside him and around him his officers came in for a share of the  background glory. Occasionally the common people had representations  of their lives and their pursuits, but the main subject of all the  valley art was the king and his doings. Sculpture and painting were  largely illustrations accompanying a history written in the  ever-present cuneiform characters.    [Illustration: FIG. 5.--ENAMELLED BRICK. NIMROUD. (FROM PERROT AND  CHIPIEZ.)]    But, while serving as history, like the picture-writings of the  Egyptians, this illustration was likewise decoration, and was designed  with that end in view. Rows upon rows of partly colored bas-reliefs  were arranged like a dado along the palace-wall, and above them  wall-paintings, or glazed tiles in patterns, carried out the color  scheme. Almost all of the color has now disappeared, but it must have  been brilliant at one time, and was doubtless in harmony with the  architecture. Both painting and sculpture were subordinate to and  dependent upon architecture. Palace-building was the chief pursuit,  and the other arts were called in mainly as adjuncts--ornamental  records of the king who built.    [Illustration: FIG. 6.--ENAMELLED BRICK. KHORSABAD. (FROM PERROT AND  CHIPIEZ.)]    THE TYPE, FORM, COLOR: There were only two distinct faces in Assyrian  art--one with and one without a beard.
