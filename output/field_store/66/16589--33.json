With the very general adoption of this style there has been an  increased interest in the few remaining fine old examples which are  scattered over the Eastern and Middle States, and the best of these are  now familiar to architects.    Few, however, know anything of the development of this style in the  Southern States, and the work now before us will be a revelation to  those who have not visited the neighborhood of Charleston and Savannah.    A large proportion of the plates is devoted to Charleston, which owes  its wealth and in fact the greater part of its existence to the  prosperous planters of former days, who made the city a winter resort.    The most notable house illustrated in the work is the William Bull  Pringle house, built by Miles Brewton in 1760. It has long been famous  as one of the finest houses in the country. Josiah Quincy, who was  entertained by its first owner, speaks in enthusiastic terms of its  beauty and the charm of its surroundings. Fourteen plates are devoted to  illustrating its various features. The two-story portico with a Doric  order below and Ionic above, relieved against the brick front laid in  Flemish bond, the simple but well-designed iron fence, flanked on either  side by a wall with massive brick posts covered with plaster, and all  overgrown with a tangle of foliage, make up a fascinating picture. The  view of the side gateway and a group of darky boys is wonderfully  picturesque, besides being very suggestive as an architectural fragment.    The detail is delicate and refined, but as a rule lacks the force and  vitality of the Northern work of the same period. The interior detail  shows a marked French influence, especially in the ceilings, mantels,  and stairway. The drawing-room, of which a double plate is given, is  probably without doubt the finest colonial room in the country, and is  certainly a fine piece of design all through.    One feature in planning which seems to be peculiar to this region, as it  is not found in the houses at the North, is the location of the  drawing-room, which is here on the second floor, usually extending  entirely across the front of the house. There is seldom, however, any  indication of this in the facade by a distinctive treatment of the  second story. But the effect is seen in the interior by the greater  importance naturally given to the staircase hall.    The Gibbs house, built in 1752, which is shown by several plates, is  also very attractive. The two interior doorways shown on one plate are  among the most refined that we can remember.    The entrance and staircase hall of the Gov. Bennett house will bear  comparison with anything of its class to be found, and the plates  showing it will be of especial value for interior work.    The Bull house is of a type apparently common in the older work of this  region. It is square and covered with a hip roof. The front is divided  into three bays, the centre and wider one crowned with a low gable or  pediment. The main floor is high, leaving a basement below and no  cellar; and the front door, an illustration of which we give herewith,  is reached by a double flight of steps protected by an iron railing.  Many of the houses are provided with high fences and massive gateposts.  A number of the plates give fine examples of these and several very  interesting pieces of iron work.    [Illustration: Doorway to the Bull House, Charleston.]    Of the churches, St. Michael's and St. Philip's in Charleston are  selected. The former was built in 1760, and is attributed to the English  architect, Gibbs, who is also credited with the old Archdale house, with  how good authority we do not know.    On the whole, the choice of material is excellent. There is a large  number of plates of detail which for architects' use are always the most  valuable, and the work of the photographer and printer has been done  unusually well.           *       *       *       *       *    _Catalogue of the Joint Exhibition of the Boston Society of Architects  and the Boston Architectural Club, April 15 to 21, 1895._ Boston:  Published for the exhibition by Bates & Guild. 96 pp., 36 illustrations.  35 cents.    A continuation of the general subject of exhibition catalogues touched  upon in our last issue as far as it relates to the catalogue of the  Boston Architectural Exhibition. The exhibition itself is quite small  comparatively speaking, including only three hundred and twenty-five  numbers, but, as the illustrations in the catalogue show, is widely  representative and of a high grade of excellence. The contributions are  very largely confined to members of the two societies under whose  management the exhibition is held. This tends to give a somewhat local  character to the exhibition as a whole. Still there is a sufficient  number of important contributions from outside to make a quite  respectable showing.    The selection of illustrations, the only ground upon which there is  excuse for reviewing the publication, is unquestionably good. There are  thirty-six in all, covering a wide range of subjects treated in a  variety of ways. The reproductions are unusually good, and the book is  neatly and well printed on good paper. The cover, designed by Mr. George  G. Will, is especially attractive and good in design.          Club Notes.      Recruits in the already very considerable list of architectural clubs  are still coming to the front. The latest to be heard from is the  Architectural Club of San Francisco, which was organized on Feb. 26 with  fourteen members, some of whom were members of the old Sketch Club of  San Francisco. It is growing in membership, and gives promise of a  bright future. Rooms have been secured in the Menisini Building, 231  Post Street. Meetings are held on the first Monday of each month, and a  paper is read and the designs submitted in the monthly competitions are  criticised and the awards announced. The first club exhibition will be  held April 26. Mr. Loring P. Rixford, Room 24, Menisini Building, 231  Post Street, San Francisco, is secretary.          Brochure Series Competitions.      From time to time, as opportunity offers, competitions in design will be  conducted by THE BROCHURE SERIES. An upright or cabinet piano case, the  subject of the first one, badly needs the attention of good designers.    The Henry F. Miller & Sons Piano Company of Boston have, for several  years, made steady advancement in the artistic qualities of their piano  cases. They have equipped their factory with a view to special work, and  have unusually good facilities for getting out pianos to order, carrying  out, architects' sketches or those of their own designers to harmonize  with different styles of interior decoration.    It is their idea to encourage the special designing of piano cases, and  to this end they have placed with the publishers fifty dollars to be  divided into prizes for such designs. Only sketches will be required,  their object being not to use the designs further than to publish the  best, but to get designers to give a little attention to this particular  problem, and so do a little towards creating an interest in the better  design of piano cases. Full particulars, including a structural diagram  and a statement of the technical requirements and limitations, will be  announced in our next issue.          Personal.      As usual at this season, a number of architects and draughtsmen are  planning to go abroad; some for only a few months, and others for a  longer time. Among these are Messrs. H. T. Pratt, Matthew Sullivan,  C. D. Maginnis, and H. C. Dunham, of Boston, and E. K. Taylor and H. L.  Jones of New York."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19270"],[0,"Directives from the Guardian (#3)"],[1,"ecclesiastical leaders to vehemently oppose and undermine the  Faith, the believers will then have a real chance to defend and vindicate  the Cause. Under present conditions it would be inadvisable for the  American community to give such issues too much prominence.\"            19: BAB, DECLARATION OF      \"In regard to the question submitted to your Assembly by the Baha'i group  at Maui, Hawaii, concerning the passage on page 88 of the book 'Baha'i  Administration,'    \"...The Guardian wishes me to inform you that the festivals of the  Declaration of the Bab and the birthday of 'Abdu'l-Baha referred to in  that passage as having been celebrated on the twenty-second of November,  1925, by the Baha'is of the Orient, are based on the lunar calendar. For  this reason the date of the celebration is not fixed, but shifts every  year. Eventually as the Master has explicitly stated, a uniform system  will have to be established by the International House of Justice.\"            20: BAB'S PHOTOGRAPH      \"May I also draw your attention to the fact that the Bab's photograph  which appeared in Nicolas' book, Siyyid 'Ali Muhammad dit le Bab, many  years ago, is not authentic, although it presents great similarity to the  original drawings of the Bab's portrait.\"            21: BAHA'I DISPENSATION (DURATION OF)      \"Concerning your question relative to the duration of the Baha'i  Dispensation. There is no contradiction between Baha'u'llah's statement in  the Iqan about the renewal of the City of God once every thousand years,  and that of the Guardian in the Dispensation to the effect that the Baha'i  cycle will extend over a period of at least 500,000 years. The apparent  contradiction is due to the confusion of the terms cycle and dispensation.  For while the Dispensation of Baha'u'llah will last for at least one  thousand years, His Cycle will extend still farther, to at least 500,000  years.    \"The Baha'i cycle is, indeed, incomparable in its greatness. It includes  not only the Prophets that will appear after Baha'u'llah, but all those  who have preceded Him ever since Adam. These should, indeed, be viewed as  constituting but preliminary stages leading gradually to the appearance of  this supreme Manifestation of God.\"            22: BAHA'IS (DESTINY OF)      \"I, for my part, am determined to reinforce the impulse that impels its  members forward to meet their destiny. The Founders of their Faith survey  from the Kingdom on high the range of their achievements, acclaim their  progress, and are ever ready to speed their eventual triumph.\"            23: BAHA'IS--NEW (ON ADMITTANCE OF NEW APPLICANTS)      \"He has noted with care what you had written him regarding the question of  admittance of applicants into the Cause. This is certainly a matter which  calls for the utmost tact, wisdom and consideration on the part of Baha'i  Assemblies. While, as he himself has repeatedly stressed, a uniform  procedure should be adopted and followed whereby every applicant should be  required to express his whole-hearted and unconditional acceptance of the  essential verities of the Cause, great care should also be taken not to  insist on matters of a secondary importance which the newcomer cannot, for  obvious reasons, fully grasp and apprehend at the beginning. Once the  applicant has been admitted in the Community with a clear understanding of  the duties and responsibilities, and essential implications which such  membership entails, there would be no difficulty for him in gradually  adjusting his whole ideas according to the requirements set forth in the  Teachings. The process of becoming a Baha'i is necessarily slow and  gradual. The essential is not that the beginner should have a full and  detailed knowledge of the Cause, a thing which is obviously impossible in  the vast majority of cases, but that he should, by an act of his own will,  be willing to uphold and follow the truth and guidance set forth in the  Teachings, and thus open his heart and mind to the reality of the  Manifestation.\"            24: BAHA'IS--NEW (ON PRESENTING THE MASTER'S WILL TO NEW APPLICANTS)      \"Concerning the best method of presenting the Master's Will to the  newcomers, Shoghi Effendi is of the opinion that the N.S.A. should first  make some suitable extracts from the Testament and to send these to all  the local Assemblies for their use, so that there may be full unity in  circulating the provisions of the Will among the new believers. The  problem of choosing such excerpts is left entirely to the discretion of  the N.S.A. The main thing, as it appears to the Guardian, is that the full  station of the Bab, Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha be clearly explained and  that the origin, nature and working of the Administrative Order of the  Faith be clearly stated. The full implications of such a recognition are  evidently beyond the comprehension of any new believer. Such a knowledge  can be acquired gradually and only when the essentials of the Faith have  been clearly recognized and adequately understood.\"            25: BAHA'IS--NEW (QUALIFICATIONS OF A NEW BELIEVER)      \"When a person becomes a Baha'i, he gives up the past only in the sense  that he is a part of this new and living Faith of God, and must seek to  pattern himself, in act and thought, along the lines laid down by  Baha'u'llah. The fact that he is by origin a Jew or a Christian, a black  man or a white man, is not important any more, but, as you say, lends  color and charm to the Baha'i community in that it demonstrates unity in  diversity.\"            26: BAHA'IS--NEW (THE \"TWO EXTREMES\" IN BRINGING IN NEW BAHA'IS)      \"The believers must discriminate between the two extremes of bringing  people into the Cause before they have fully grasped its fundamentals and  making it too hard for them, expecting too much of them, before they  accept them. This requires truly keen judgment, as it is unfair to people  to allow them to embrace a movement the true meaning of which they have  not fully grasped. It is equally unfair to expect them to be perfect  Baha'is before they can enter the Faith. Many teaching problems arise out  of these two extremes...\"            27: BAHA'IS (TWO KINDS OF)      \"There are two kinds of Baha'is, one might say: those whose religion is  Baha'i and those who live for the Faith. Needless to say if we can belong  to the latter category, if we can be in the vanguard of heroes, martyrs  and saints, it is more praiseworthy in the sight of God.\"            28: BAHA'I WAY OF LIFE (THE STRENGTH OF THE CAUSE)      \"It is good for the Baha'is to learn that being a Baha'i is essentially an  inner thing, or way of life, and not dependent on fixed patterns.  Important as our organized Institutions are, they are not the Faith  itself. The strength of the Cause grows no matter how much disrupted its  activities may temporarily be. This we see over and over again, in lands  where the Faith has been temporarily banned; at times when the believers  are persecuted and even killed; where they are serving all alone or  scattered and isolated. So it has been a stimulating experience for the  American believers to be without their schools for a few years, rather  than a depressing one.\"            29: BAHA'U'LLAH (IN ACCEPTING)      \"In accepting Baha'u'llah you have accepted Christ in His appearance as  the Father, as He Himself so clearly foretold. The Catholic Church does  not believe this; on the contrary, it still awaits the return of Christ.  If you decide, in order to be buried next to your dear husband, to return  to the Church, you either would have to, in good faith, deny Baha'u'llah  or you would be just using the church as a means to satisfy a desire of  your own, which would certainly not be an upright and conscientious thing  to do.    \"When you think that your husband's soul is now free of the limitations of  this world, and that he no doubt is beginning to see religious truth in  its true light and to appreciate the station of Baha'u'llah, you should  ask yourself whether he would wish you to leave the truth for this day and  re-enter the church just for the sake of your dust being near his dust.  Your spirit, when you pass away, will be near his spirit; of what  importance, then, is the body? He will pray for your guidance in this  matter.\"            30: BELIEVERS, NEW (ACCEPT CAUSE WITHOUT QUALIFICATIONS)      \"The believers, and particularly those who have not had sufficient  experience in teaching, should be very careful in the way they present the  teachings of the Cause. Sincerity, devotion and Faith are not the sole  conditions of successful teaching. Tactfulness, extreme caution and wisdom  are equally important. We should not be in a hurry when we announce the  message to the public and we should be careful to present the teachings in  their entirety and not to alter them for the sake of others. Allegiance to  the Faith cannot be partial and half-hearted. Either we should accept the  Cause without any qualification whatsoever or cease calling ourselves  Baha'is. The new believers should be made to realize that it is not  sufficient for them to accept some aspects of the teachings and reject  those which cannot suit their mentality in order to become fully  recognized and active followers of the Faith. In this way all sorts of  misunderstandings will vanish and the organic unity of the Cause will be  preserved.\"            31: BELIEVERS, REMOVAL OF      \"Concerning the removal of believers I feel that such a vitally important  matter should be given the most serious consideration and preferably be  referred to the National Assembly for further consideration and final  decision. We should be slow to accept and reluctant to remove. I fully  approve and whole-heartedly and unreservedly uphold the principle to which  you refer that personalities should not be made centers around which the  community may revolve but they should be subordinated under"]]]
