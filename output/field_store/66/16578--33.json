Thou canst read and write, but beyond that thy knowledge  runneth not. Your mind seems to be set on the water, and when you  are not in it you are on it. Therefore it appears, to me, to be  flying in the face of Providence to try to keep you on shore. Had  your poor mother lived, it would have been a different thing. Her  mind was set upon your becoming a clerk; but there, one might as  well try to make a silk purse from the ear of a sow. But I tell you  again, count not too much upon this promise. It may be years before  Mr. Francis Drake may be in a position to keep it.\"    Had Ned Hearne watched for Captain Drake's second voyage, he would,  indeed, as his father had said, have waited long. Three days after  the conversation, however, a horseman from Plymouth rode into the  little village, and inquired for the house of Master Hearne. Being  directed thither, he rode up in haste to the gate.    \"Here is a letter!\" he cried, \"for the son of the schoolmaster, who  goes by the name of the Otter.\"    \"I am he,\" Ned cried. \"What is it, and who can have written to me?\"    \"It is a letter from His Honor, the Worshipful Mr. Francis Drake.\"    Seizing the letter, Ned broke the seal, read a few lines, threw his  cap into the air with a shout of joy, and rushed in to his father.    \"Father,\" he said, \"Captain Drake has written to acquaint me that  one of the boys in his ship has been taken ill, and cannot go; and  that it has pleased him to appoint me to go in his place; and that  I am to be at Plymouth in three days, at the utmost, bringing with  me what gear I may require for the expedition.\"    The schoolmaster was a little taken aback at this sudden prospect  of departure, but he had always been wholly indulgent to his son,  and it was not in his nature to refuse to allow him to avail  himself of an opportunity which appeared to be an excellent one.  The danger of these expeditions was, no doubt, very great; but the  spoils were in proportion, and there was not a boy or man of the  seafaring population of Devon who would not gladly have gone with  the adventurous captains.          Chapter 2: Friends and Foes.        Three days after the receipt of the letter, Ned Hearne stood with  his bundle on the quay at Plymouth. Near him lay a large rowboat  from the ships, waiting to take off the last comers. A little way  behind, Captain Francis Drake and his brother, Captain John Drake,  talked with the notable people of Plymouth, who had come down to  bid them farewell; the more since this was a holiday, being Whitsun  Eve, the 24th May, and all in the town who could spare time had  made their way down to the Hove to watch the departure of the  expedition; for none could say how famous this might become, or how  great deeds would be accomplished by the two little craft lying  there. Each looker on thought to himself that it might be that, to  the end of his life, he should tell his children and his children's  children, with pride, \"I saw Mr. Drake start for his great voyage.\"    Small, indeed, did the fleet appear, in comparison to the work  which it had to do. It was composed of but two vessels. The first,  the Pacha, of seventy tons, carrying forty-seven men and boys, was  commanded by Captain Francis Drake himself. By her side was the  Swanne, of twenty-five tons, carrying twenty-six men and boys, and  commanded by Captain John Drake. This was truly but a small affair  to undertake so great a voyage.    In those days the Spaniards were masters of the whole of South  America, and of the Isles of the West Indies. They had many very  large towns full of troops, and great fleets armed to carry the  treasure which was collected there to Spain. It did seem almost  like an act of madness that two vessels, which by the side of those  of the Spaniards were mere cockleshells, manned in all by less than  eighty men, should attempt to enter a region where they would be  regarded, and rightly, as enemies, and where the hand of every man  would be against them.    Captain Drake and his men thought little of these things. The  success which had attended their predecessors had inspired the  English sailors with a belief in their own invincibility, when  opposed to the Spaniards. They looked, to a certain extent, upon  their mission as a crusade. In those days England had a horror of  Popery, and Spain was the mainstay and supporter of this religion.  The escape which England had had of having Popery forced upon it,  during the reign of Mary, by her spouse, Philip of Spain, had been  a narrow one; and even now, it was by no means certain that Spain  would not, sooner or later, endeavor to carry out the pretensions  of the late queen's husband. Then, too, terrible tales had come of  the sufferings of the Indians at the hands of the Spaniards; and it  was certain that the English sailors who had fallen into the hands  of Spain had been put to death, with horrible cruelty. Thus, then,  the English sailors regarded the Spaniards as the enemy of their  country, as the enemy of their religion, and as the enemy of  humanity. Besides which, it cannot be denied that they viewed them  as rich men, well worth plundering; and although, when it came to  fighting, it is probable that hatred overbore the thought of gain,  it is certain that the desire for gold was, in itself, the main  incentive to those who sailed upon these expeditions.    Amid the cheers of the townsfolk the boats pushed off, Mr. Francis  Drake and his brother waving their plumed hats to the burghers of  Plymouth, and the sailors giving a hurrah, as they bent to the  oars. Ned Hearne, who had received a kind word of greeting from Mr.  Drake, had taken his place in the bow of one of the boats, lost in  admiration at the scene; and at the thought that he was one of this  band of heroes, who were going out to fight the Spaniards, and to  return laden with countless treasure wrested from them. At the  thought his eyes sparkled, his blood seemed to dance through his  veins.    The western main, in those days, was a name almost of enchantment.  Such strange tales had been brought home, by the voyagers who had  navigated those seas, of the wonderful trees, the bright birds, the  beauties of nature, the gold and silver, and the abundance of all  precious things, that it was the dream of every youngster on the  seaboard some day to penetrate to these charmed regions. A week  since, and the realization of the dream had appeared beyond his  wildest hopes. Now, almost with the suddenness of a transformation  scene, this had changed; and there was he on his way out to the  Swanne, a part of the expedition itself. It was to the Swanne that  he had been allotted, for it was on board that ship that the boy  whose place he was to take had been seized with illness.    Although but twenty-five tons in burden, the Swanne made a far  greater show than would be made by a craft of that size in the  present day. The ships of the time lay but lightly on the water,  while their hulls were carried up to a prodigious height; and it is  not too much to say that the portion of the Swanne, above water,  was fully as large as the hull which we see of a merchantman of  four times her tonnage. Still, even so, it was but a tiny craft to  cross the Atlantic, and former voyages had been generally made in  larger ships.    Mr. Francis Drake, however, knew what he was about. He considered  that large ships required large crews to be left behind to defend  them, that they drew more water, and were less handy; and he  resolved, in this expedition, he would do no small part of his work  with pinnaces and rowboats; and of these he had three fine craft,  now lying in pieces in his hold, ready to fit together on arriving  in the Indies.    As they neared the ships the two boats separated, and Ned soon  found himself alongside of the Swanne. A ladder hung at her side,  and up this Ned followed his captain; for in those days the strict  etiquette that the highest goes last had not been instituted.    \"Master Holyoake,\" said Mr. John Drake, to a big and  powerful-looking man standing near, \"this is the new lad, whose  skill in swimming, and whose courage, I told you of yesternight. He  will, I doubt not, be found as willing as he is brave; and I trust  that you will put him in the way of learning his business as a  sailor. It is his first voyage. He comes on board a green hand, but  I doubt not that, ere the voyage be finished, he will have become a  smart young sailor.\"    \"I will put him through,\" John Holyoake, sailing master of the  ship, replied; for in those days the sailing master was the  navigator of the ship, and the captain was as often as not a  soldier, who knew nothing whatever about seamanship. The one sailed  the ship, the other fought it; and the admirals were, in those  days, more frequently known as generals, and held that position on  shore.    As Ned looked round the deck, he thought that he had never seen a  finer set of sailors. All were picked men, hardy and experienced,  and for the most part young. Some had made previous voyages to the  West Indies, but the greater portion were new to that country. They  looked the men on whom a captain could rely, to the last. Tall and  stalwart, bronzed with the sun, and with a reckless and fearless  expression about them, which boded ill to any foes upon whom they  might fall.    Although Ned had never been to sea on a long voyage, he had sailed  too often in the fishing boats of his native village to have any  qualm of seasickness, or to feel in any degree like a new hand. He  was, therefore, at once assigned to a place and duty.    An hour later the admiral, as Mr. Francis Drake was called, fired a  gun, the two vessels hoisted their broad sails and turned their  heads from shore, and the crews of both ships gave a parting cheer,  as they turned their faces to the south.    As Ned was not in the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19207"],[0,"The Firelight Fairy Book (#3)"],[1,"of a high lonely rock against whose steep sides the waves of the  underground ocean were forever foaming and breaking, and it was half in  ruins and was very poorly lighted.    The Prince took his place in the kitchen, and sought for an opportunity  to prevent the marriage of Dragondel and the Queen.    For four days of the precious week, however, the poor Prince was kept so  busy baking and making pastries for the coming of the bride that he did  not have an instant to ask questions or do anything else.    In the morning hours of the fifth day there was a terrible moaning and  roaring outside, and the cooks rushed to the kitchen windows. An unhappy  fishing boat had been swept by the wind too near Dragondel's castle, the  enchanted whirlpool had formed, and caught the boat in its awful circle.  Now it went slowly round the outer edge, now, going faster and faster,  it slid down the side of the awful funnel, and finally it vanished. An  instant later, the whirlpool had disappeared, leaving the sea roaring  and foaming.    The Prince shuddered.    \"Well you may shudder,\" said the chief cook, \"for such would have been  your fate if our master's brother had not carried with him the talisman  which rules the whirlpool.\"    \"Talisman? What talisman?\" said the Prince affecting stupidity.    \"Why the little golden hand, you fool,\" said the chief cook.    \"My! it must be a great big hand to be able to quiet that whirlpool,\"  said the Prince.    \"Big indeed, you ninny!\" growled the cook. \"Why, the magic hand is only  as big as a baby's hand. I've seen it many times. The master carries it  in his pocket, and puts it under his pillow while he sleeps.\"    So, later on, when his work was done, and everybody had gone to bed, the  Prince, in the hope of stealing the talisman, tried to make his way to  Dragondel's bedchamber. But when he reached the foot of the stairs which  led to the Enchanter's room, he found it guarded by two black panthers  which stared at him with insolent yellow eyes and switched their long  tails. The Prince went outdoors, to see if there was any hope of  climbing to the room along the outer wall, and found that the windows of  Dragondel's chamber overlooked a cliff falling thousands of feet sheer  to the dark sea. Far, far away, the Prince saw the glow of Lantern Land.  Only a short time remained to him in which to save his beloved lady of  the lanterns.    As he wandered about, very sick at heart, he saw a little black cat  running madly back and forth along the edge of a steep cliff from one of  whose crevices came a persistent, unhappy mewing. The poor cat was a  mother-cat, and was trying to rescue a kitten of hers that had fallen  down between the rocks. At great risk of being dashed to pieces himself,  the brave Prince climbed down the precipice, rescued the kitten, and  gave it back to its anxious mother.    \"Thank you, brave youth,\" said the old cat.    \"May it some day be within my power to help you as you have helped me.\"    \"You can help me this very moment,\" said the Prince. And he told the cat  who he was, why he had come to the castle, and of his desire to get  possession of the talisman.    \"I will help you get the talisman,\" said the cat. \"The panthers will let  me pass, for they are cousins of mine. But you must make another little  golden hand to take the place of the one I shall steal; for if Dragondel  misses the golden hand, he will summon his demons to find it, and we  shall both lose our lives. Go now to the kitchen, carve a small hand  with the fingers close together and the thumb lying close to the  fingers, gild it over with the gold dust you have had given you for the  pastry icings, and bring it to me tomorrow night at this very hour.\"    So the Prince worked the rest of the night carving and gilding the  little golden hand, and on the next night he gave it to the cat. The cat  took it in her mouth as she would have a mouse, walked coolly by the  panthers, and entered Dragondel's room. She had just succeeded in  getting the true hand out from under the magician's pillow when  Dragondel woke up. The cat was clever enough to pretend to be engaged in  a mouse-hunt, so the Enchanter paid no attention to her and fell asleep  once more. When the cat, however, got under Dragondel's couch again, the  two hands lay side by side and she could not remember just which one was  the talisman and which one the false hand. So because she had to act  quickly, she put one of the hands under the pillow, brought the other to  the Prince and told him her story. But so well matched were the little  hands, that even the Prince was far from certain that he had not got his  own hand back again.    And now came the seventh day, the day on which Dragondel, the blue dog,  and all the wicked Enchanter's friends were to sail to Lantern Land for  the marriage ceremony. The iron ship, made gay with a thousand small  scarlet lanterns, stood ready to carry them over. The Enchanter and his  company got in, and the vessel left the island.    The Prince stood watching the ship from the top of the cliffs. What  anxiety was in his heart! If Dragondel still possessed the true  talisman, he would cross the whirlpool safely, and marry the beautiful  Queen of Lantern Land.    The vessel sped on. It was now at some distance from the island.    \"All is lost,\" thought the Prince with a sinking heart; \"Dragondel has  the true talisman.\" And in his bitterness he was about to throw the  little golden hand which lay in his pocket down into the sea.    Suddenly the air became filled with a terrible moaning; the sea became  troubled; the whirlpool awoke. And the Prince saw the red lights of the  Enchanter's ship whirled round and round, faster and faster, till they  disappeared forever in the waters of the sunless sea.    As for the Prince, he soon found another boat, and taking with him the  talisman, his fellow servants, and the black cat and her kittens, he  returned to Lantern Land, married the Queen, and lived happily ever  after.             THE ADVENTURES OF FLORIAN    [Illustration: Boy walking through forest following a small ball.]      Once upon a time there lived in an old and ruinous house by the shore of  the wild sea, a widowed nobleman and his only child, a daughter named  Isabella. They were very poor in spite of their high birth, so poor that  one by one the fields and woods of their little domain had been sold in  order to buy the bare necessities of life. Knowing that his death would  leave Isabella quite alone in the world and practically penniless, her  father brought her up more like a boy than a girl; she could ride a  horse as gracefully as an Amazon, she could swim like a born mermaid,  and even outdo her father in his favorite sport of fencing. Yet so sweet  was the gentle nature which the girl had inherited from her mother, that  this strange upbringing never spoiled her in the least.    Late one October evening, when the fierce gusts of wind from the sea  shook the old house to its very foundation and set the ragged tapestries  swaying on the walls, Isabella's father died, leaving her only the  ruinous house, a handful of copper pence, and a single golden florin.  The sum of money was enough to keep body and soul together for a few  weeks, but what was Isabella to do when the little pittance was gone?  Her father had once counseled her to go to the King and ask for his  protection; but the King's castle was hundreds of miles distant, and  Isabella shrank from begging or the highway.    At last the brave girl resolved to make her own way in the world. Taking  the golden florin with her, she went to a neighboring town, and  purchased a suit of clothes such as pages and squires wear who are in  the service of noblemen. She then caused her black hair to be cut short,  boy-fashion, put on the boy's clothes she had purchased, and went into  the market-place to see if she could not find a situation in the service  of some great family.    Now, it was the custom in those days for masters and servants to meet by  a fountain in the market-place, the masters who were in need of servants  standing on one side of the fountain, the servants who were in search of  masters on the other.    When Isabella came into the market-place, there was no one standing on  the masters' side of the fountain, but on the other side, ready for the  first master who should appear, was a little group of noisy and impudent  squires and pages. Isabella, or, as she now called herself, Florian,  strode boldly over and joined this group, her heart beating high with  the thrill of the great adventure.    Suddenly a black knight, mounted on a black horse and leading another  horse by the bridle, clattered over the cobble-stones of the square, and  taking his place by the fountain, called on the pages to come to him. In  spite of the horseman's summons, however, the pages paid no attention to  him at all. Curious to know the reason of this disdain, Florian  questioned a fellow page, and was told that the knight was no other than  the Enchanter of the Black Rock, and that no page or squire would take  service with him because his castle was haunted by goblins, ghosts, and  all manner of terrifying spirits.    Now, Florian was no coward, and, as the saying is, beggars cannot be  choosers. So, much to the astonishment of the pages, Florian walked over  to the Enchanter, who sat fuming with anger and impatience, and offered  to go with him. The Knight bade Florian mount the horse which he was  holding; and amid the cat-calls and hooting of the pages, master and boy  galloped away.    All day long they rode, and when it was near the end of the afternoon  Florian found himself at the edge of a wild and desolate moor. Within  the great circle of the horizon, under the pale sky, not a tree, not a  house, not a shepherd's hut even was to be seen--nothing but the great  barren waste rolling, rising and falling to the very edge of the world."]]]
