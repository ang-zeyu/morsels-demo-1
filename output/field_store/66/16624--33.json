He obeyed with fear and trembling; they quaffed the liquor in  profound silence, and then returned to their game.    By degrees Rip's awe and apprehension subsided. He even ventured, when  no eye was fixed upon him, to taste the beverage, which he found had  much of the flavor of excellent Hollands. He was naturally a thirsty  soul, and was soon tempted to repeat the draught. One taste provoked  another; and he repeated his visits to the flagon so often that at  length his senses were overpowered, his eyes swam in his head, his head  gradually declined, and he fell into a deep sleep.      II    On waking he found himself on the green knoll whence he had first seen  the old man of the glen. He rubbed his eyes--it was a bright, sunny  morning. The birds were hopping and twittering among the bushes, and  the eagle was wheeling aloft, and breasting the pure mountain breeze.  \"Surely,\" thought Rip, \"I have not slept here all night.\" He recalled  the occurrences before he fell asleep. The strange man with a keg of  liquor--the mountain ravine--the wild retreat among the rocks--the  woe-begone party at ninepins--the flagon--\"Oh! that flagon! that wicked  flagon!\" thought Rip; \"what excuse shall I make to Dame Van Winkle?\"    He looked round for his gun, but in place of the clean, well-oiled  fowling piece, he found an old firelock lying by him, the barrel  incrusted with rust, the lock falling off, and the stock worm-eaten. He  now suspected that the grave revelers of the mountain had put a trick  upon him and, having dosed him with liquor, had robbed him of his gun.  Wolf, too, had disappeared, but he might have strayed away after a  squirrel or partridge. He whistled after him, and shouted his name, but  all in vain; the echoes repeated his whistle and shout, but no dog was  to be seen.    He determined to revisit the scene of the last evening's gambol, and if  he met with any of the party, to demand his dog and gun. As he rose to  walk, he found himself stiff in the joints, and wanting in his usual  activity. \"These mountain beds do not agree with me,\" thought Rip, \"and  if this frolic should lay me up with a fit of the rheumatism, I shall  have a blessed time with Dame Van Winkle.\" With some difficulty he got  down into the glen; he found the gully up which he and his companion had  ascended the preceding evening; but to his astonishment a mountain  stream was now foaming down it, leaping from rock to rock, and filling  the glen with babbling murmurs. He, however, made shift to scramble up  its sides, working his toilsome way through thickets of birch,  sassafras, and witch-hazel, and sometimes tripped up or entangled by the  wild grapevines that twisted their coils from tree to tree, and spread a  kind of network in his path.    At length he reached to where the ravine had opened through the cliffs  to the amphitheater; but no traces of such opening remained. The rocks  presented a high, impenetrable wall, over which the torrent came  tumbling in a sheet of feathery foam, and fell into a broad, deep basin,  black from the shadows of the surrounding forest. Here, then, poor Rip  was brought to a stand. He again called and whistled after his dog; he  was only answered by the cawing of a flock of idle crows sporting high  in air about a dry tree that overhung a sunny precipice; and who, secure  in their elevation, seemed to look down and scoff at the poor man's  perplexities. What was to be done?--the morning was passing away, and  Rip felt famished for want of his breakfast. He grieved to give up his  dog and gun; he dreaded to meet his wife; but it would not do to starve  among the mountains. He shook his head, shouldered the rusty firelock,  and, with a heart full of trouble and anxiety, turned his steps  homeward.    As he approached the village he met a number of people, but none whom he  knew, which somewhat surprised him, for he had thought himself  acquainted with every one in the country round. Their dress, too, was of  a different fashion from that to which he was accustomed. They all  stared at him with equal marks of surprise, and whenever they cast their  eyes upon him, invariably stroked their chins. The constant recurrence  of this gesture induced Rip, involuntarily, to do the same, when, to his  astonishment, he found his beard had grown a foot long!    He had now entered the skirts of the village. A troop of strange  children ran at his heels, hooting after him, and pointing at his gray  beard. The dogs, too, not one of which he recognized for an old  acquaintance, barked at him as he passed. The very village was altered;  it was larger and more populous. There were rows of houses which he had  never seen before, and those which had been his familiar haunts had  disappeared. Strange names were over the doors--strange faces at the  windows--everything was strange. His mind now misgave him; he began to  doubt whether both he and the world around him were not bewitched.  Surely this was his native village, which he had left but the day  before. There stood the Catskill Mountains--there ran the silver Hudson  at a distance--there was every hill and dale precisely as it had always  been. Rip was sorely perplexed. \"That flagon last night,\" thought he,  \"has addled my poor head sadly!\"    It was with some difficulty that he found the way to his own house,  which he approached with silent awe, expecting every moment to hear the  shrill voice of Dame Van Winkle. He found the house gone to decay--the  roof fallen in, the windows shattered, and the doors off the hinges. A  half-starved dog that looked like Wolf was skulking about it. Rip called  him by name, but the cur snarled, showed his teeth, and passed on. This  was an unkind cut indeed. \"My very dog,\" sighed Rip, \"has forgotten me!\"    He entered the house, which, to tell the truth, Dame Van Winkle had  always kept in neat order. It was empty, forlorn, and apparently  abandoned. He called loudly for his wife and children--the lonely  chambers rang for a moment with his voice, and then all again was  silence.      III    He now hurried forth, and hastened to his old resort, the village  inn--but it, too, was gone. A large, rickety wooden building stood in  its place, with great gaping windows, some of them broken and mended  with old hats and petticoats, and over the door was painted, \"The Union  Hotel, by Jonathan Doolittle.\" Instead of the great tree that used to  shelter the quiet little Dutch inn of yore, there now was reared a  tall, naked pole, with something on the top that looked like a red  nightcap, and from it was fluttering a flag, on which was a singular  assemblage of stars and stripes; all this was strange and  incomprehensible. He recognized on the sign, however, the ruby face of  King George, under which he had smoked so many a peaceful pipe; but even  this was singularly changed. The red coat was changed for one of blue  and buff, a sword was held in the hand instead of a scepter, the head  was decorated with a cocked hat, and underneath was painted in large  characters, GENERAL WASHINGTON.    There was, as usual, a crowd of folk about the door, but none that Rip  recollected. The very character of the people seemed changed. There was  a busy, bustling tone about it, instead of the accustomed drowsy  tranquility. He looked in vain for the sage Nicholas Vedder, with his  broad face, double chin, and long pipe, uttering clouds of tobacco smoke  instead of idle speeches; or Van Bummel, the schoolmaster, doling forth  the contents of an ancient newspaper. In place of these, a lean fellow,  with his pockets full of handbills, was haranguing vehemently about  rights of citizens--elections--members of congress--Bunker's  Hill--heroes of seventy-six--and other words, which were a perfect  jargon to the bewildered Van Winkle.    The appearance of Rip, with his long, grizzled beard, his rusty fowling  piece, his uncouth dress, and an army of women and children at his  heels, soon attracted the attention of the tavern politicians. They  crowded round him, eyeing him from head to foot with great curiosity.  The orator bustled up to him, and, drawing him partly aside, inquired  \"On which side he voted?\" Rip stared in vacant stupidity. Another short  but busy little fellow pulled him by the arm, and, rising on tiptoe,  inquired in his ear, \"Whether he was Federal or Democrat?\" Rip was  equally at a loss to comprehend the question; when a knowing,  self-important old gentleman, in a sharp cocked hat, made his way  through the crowd, putting them to the right and left with his elbows as  he passed, and planting himself before Van Winkle, with one arm akimbo,  the other resting on his cane, his keen eyes and sharp hat penetrating,  as it were, into his very soul, demanded, in an austere tone, \"What  brought him to the election with a gun on his shoulder, and a mob at his  heels; and whether he meant to breed a riot in the village?\"--\"Alas!  gentlemen,\" cried Rip, somewhat dismayed, \"I am a poor, quiet man, a  native of the place, and a loyal subject of the king, God bless him!\"    Here a general shout burst from the bystanders--\"A tory! a tory! a spy!  a refugee! hustle him! away with him!\" It was with great difficulty that  the self-important man in the cocked hat restored order; and having  assumed a tenfold [v]austerity of brow, demanded again of the unknown  culprit, what he came there for, and whom he was seeking! The poor man  humbly assured him that he meant no harm, but merely came there in  search of some of his neighbors.    \"Well--who are they? Name them.\"    Rip bethought himself a moment, and inquired, \"Where's Nicholas Vedder?\"    There was a silence for a little while, when an old man replied, in a  thin, piping voice, \"Nicholas Vedder! why, he is dead and gone these  eighteen years! There was a wooden tombstone in the churchyard that used  to tell all about him, but that's rotten and gone, too.\"    \"Where"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19722"],[0,"A Child's Garden of Verses (#3)"],[1,"dining room;      See the pictures on the walls,      Heroes, fights and festivals      And in a corner find the toys      Of the old Egyptian boys.

At night, I go on board and say        Good night to all my friends on shore;      I shut my eyes and sail away        And see and hear no more.        And sometimes things to bed I take,        As prudent sailors have to do;      Perhaps a slice of wedding-cake,        Perhaps a toy or two.        All night across the dark we steer:        But when the day returns at last      Safe in my room, beside the pier,        I find my vessel fast.

Here is the mill with the humming of thunder,        Here is the weir with the wonder of foam,      Here is the sluice with the race running under--        Marvelous places, though handy to home!        Sounds of the village grow stiller and stiller,        Stiller the note of the birds on the hill;      Dusty and dim are the eyes of the miller,        Deaf are his ears with the moil of the mill.        Years may go by, and the wheel in the river        Wheel as it wheels for us, children, to-day.      Wheel and keep roaring and foaming for ever        Long after all of the boys are away.        Home from the Indies and home from the ocean,        Heroes and soldiers we all shall come home;      Still we shall find the old mill wheel in motion,        Turning and churning that river to foam.

[Illustration]    [Illustration]          THE UNSEEN PLAYMATE          When children are playing alone on the green,      In comes the playmate that never was seen.      When children are happy and lonely and good,      The Friend of the Children comes out of the wood.        Nobody heard him and nobody saw,      His is a picture you never could draw,      But he's sure to be present, abroad or at home,      When children are happy and playing alone.        He lies in the laurels, he runs on the grass,      He sings when you tinkle the musical glass;      Whene'er you are happy and cannot tell why,      The Friend of the Children is sure to be by!        He loves to be little, he hates to be big,      'Tis he that inhabits the caves that you dig;      'Tis he when you play with your soldiers of tin      That sides with the Frenchman and never can win.        'Tis he, when at night you go off to your bed,      Bids you go to your sleep and not trouble your head;      For wherever they're lying, in cupboard or shelf,      'Tis he will take care of your playthings himself.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]          MY SHIP AND I.          O it's I that am the captain of a tidy little ship,        Of a ship that goes a-sailing on the pond;      And my ship it keeps a-turning all around and all about;      But when I'm a little older, I shall find the secret out        How to send my vessel sailing on beyond.        For I mean to grow as little as the dolly at the helm,        And the dolly I intend to come alive;      And with him beside to help me, it's a-sailing I shall go,      It's a-sailing on the water, when the jolly breezes blow      And the vessel goes a divie-divie dive.        O it's then you'll see me sailing through the rushes and the reeds,        And you'll hear the water singing at the prow;      For beside the dolly sailor, I'm to voyage and explore,      To land upon the island where no dolly was before,        And to fire the penny cannon in the bow.    [Illustration]          THE WIND          I saw you toss the kites on high      And blow the birds about the sky;      And all around I heard you pass,      Like ladies' skirts across the grass--        O wind, a-blowing all day long!        O wind, that sings so loud a song!        I saw the different things you did,      But always you yourself you hid.      I felt you push, I heard you call,      I could not see yourself at all--        O wind, a-blowing all day long,        O wind, that sings so loud a song!        O you that are so strong and cold,      O blower, are you young or old?      Are you a beast of field and tree,      Or just a stronger child than me?        O wind, a-blowing all day long,        O wind, that sings so loud a song!    [Illustration: \"_I felt you push, I heard you call._\"]    [Illustration]          A GOOD BOY          I woke before the morning, I was happy all the day,      I never said an ugly word, but smiled and stuck to play.        And now at last the sun is going down behind the wood,      And I am very happy, for I know that I've been good.        My bed is waiting cool and fresh, with linen smooth and fair,      And I must off to sleepsin-by, and not forget my prayer.        I know that, till to-morrow I shall see the sun arise,      No ugly dream shall fright my mind, no ugly sight my eyes.        But slumber hold me tightly, till I waken in the dawn,      And hear the thrushes singing in the lilacs round the lawn.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]          GOOD AND BAD CHILDREN          Children, you are very little,      And your bones are very brittle;      If you would grow great and stately,      You must try to walk sedately.        You must still be bright and quiet,      And content with simple diet;      And remain, through all bewild'ring,      Innocent and honest children.        Happy hearts and happy faces,      Happy play in grassy places--      That was how, in ancient ages,      Children grew to kings and sages.        But the unkind and the unruly,      And the sort who eat unduly,      They must never hope for glory--      Theirs is quite a different story!        Cruel children, crying babies,      All grow up as geese and gabies,      Hated, as their age increases,      By their nephews and their nieces.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]          PICTURE-BOOKS IN WINTER          Summer fading, winter comes--      Frosty mornings, tingling thumbs,      Window robins, winter rooks,      And the picture story-books.        Water now is turned to stone      Nurse and I can walk upon;      Still we find the flowing brooks      In the picture story-books.        All the pretty things put by      Wait upon the childrens' eye,      Sheep and shepherds, trees and crooks,      In the picture story-books.        We may see how all things are,      Seas and cities, near and far,      And the flying fairies' looks,      In the picture story-books.        How am I to sing your praise,      Happy chimney-corner days,      Sitting safe in nursery nooks,      Reading picture story-books?    [Illustration]    [Illustration]    [Illustration]          THE SWING          How do you like to go up in a swing,        Up in the air so blue?      Oh, I do think it the pleasantest thing        Ever a child can do!        Up in the air and over the wall,        Till I can see so wide,      Rivers and trees and cattle and all        Over the countryside--        Till I look down on the garden green,        Down on the roof so brown--      Up in the air I go flying again,        Up in the air and down!    [Illustration]          A THOUGHT          It is very nice to think       The world is full of meat and drink      With little children saying grace       In every Christian kind of place.          ARMIES IN THE FIRE          The lamps now glitter down the street;      Faintly sound the falling feet      And the blue even slowly falls      About the garden trees and walls.        Now in the falling of the gloom      The red fire paints the empty room;      And warmly on the roof it looks,      And flickers on the backs of books.        Armies march by tower and spire      Of cities blazing, in the fire;--      Till as I gaze with staring eyes,      The armies fade, the lustre dies.        Then once again the glow returns;      Again the phantom city burns;      And down the red-hot valley, lo!      The phantom armies marching go!        Blinking embers, tell me true      Where are those armies marching to,      And what the burning city is      That crumbles in your furnaces!    [Illustration]          MY KINGDOM          Down by a shining water well      I found a very little dell,          No higher than my head.      The heather and the gorse about      In summer bloom were coming out,          Some yellow and some red.        I called the little pool a sea;      The little hills were big to me;          For I am very small.      I made a boat, I made a town,      I searched the caverns up and down,          And named them one and all.        And all about was mine, I said,      The little sparrows overhead,          The little minnows, too.      This was the world and I was king;      For me the bees came by to sing,          For me the swallows flew.        I played there were no deeper seas,      Nor any wider plains than these,          Nor other kings than me.      At last I heard my mother call      Out from the house at evenfall,          To call me home to tea.        And I must rise and leave my dell,      And leave my dimpled water well,          And leave my heather blooms.      Alas! and as my home I neared,      How very big my nurse appeared,          How great and cool the rooms!
