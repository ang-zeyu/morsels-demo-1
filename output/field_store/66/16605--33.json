Paulinus, perhaps a Briton by  birth, was chosen for this office, and was consecrated Bishop of York  before he set out. He has been identified with a certain Rum the son of  Urien. This enterprise met with great and immediate success, in which  political reasons probably played a considerable part; and on Easterday  627, the most important date in the ecclesiastical history of York, the  king Edwin, his family, and many of his court were baptised there in a  wooden chapel temporarily erected on the site of the present minster.  Immediately afterwards Edwin begun to build a church of stone, dedicated  to St. Peter, on the same site. The baptism of the king was followed by  a wholesale conversion of thousands of his subjects, and it is stated  that Paulinus was forced to stay over a month in one place to baptise  the crowds who flocked to him. Paulinus was confirmed in his appointment  to the see by the king, and immediately after received the pall,  together with Honorius of Canterbury, which authorised him to assemble  councils and to consecrate bishops. The pall was not given to any of his  successors until Egbert (732 A.D.). In view of the subsequent struggles  for precedence between the sees of Canterbury and York, the following  passage in a letter from the Pope to Edwin is of interest:--\"We have  ordered,\" the Pope says, \"two palls, one for each of the metropolitans,  that is for Honorius and Paulinus, that in case one of them is called  from this life, the other may, in virtue of this our authority, appoint  a bishop in his place.\" (Bede, \"Eccl. Hist.,\" Smith edit., book ii.,  cap. 17, p. 98.)    [Illustration: St. Mary's Abbey.]    This early prosperity of the northern Church did not last long. In 633  Edwin was defeated and killed at a battle near Hatfield, and a period of  anarchy and persecution followed. Thereupon Paulinus, with Ethelburga,  the queen, fled to Kent, leaving behind him only one evangelist, by name  James the Deacon. It is probable that the greater part of Northumbria  thereupon fell back into paganism, and by the flight of Paulinus the  Catholic Church, or that part of it immediately under the influence and  control of the bishops of Rome, lost its hold on the north, which it was  not to regain without a struggle. The anarchy came to an end with the  accession of Oswald, a Christian, who had been converted, not by  Paulinus, but by the Celtic Church of Iona. It was this circumstance  which led to the establishment of the influence of that Church in  Northumbria. Oswald did not look to Rome or Canterbury for evangelists  when he set to work to establish Christianity in his kingdom, but to  Iona, whence, in 635 A.D., was dispatched a bishop, Aidan, who settled  at Lindisfarne (Holy Island). From this time there were two influences  at work among the Christians in Northumbria--that of the older and more  national British Church which had survived the flood of heathen  invasion; and that of the later Catholic Church, which originated with  the mission of Augustine.    The conflict between these two influences reached its height in the time  of Alfred. Oswald completed the church began by Edwin: it remained under  the rule of Aidan, as no evangelists were sent from the south to take  the place of Paulinus, though it is said that James the Deacon continued  his missionary work in the North Riding. In 642 Oswald was killed in  battle, and Deira and Bernicia were again split up into two kingdoms.  With this division came also religious difficulties between the Church  of Iona and the Catholic Church of the south. These difficulties  culminated in the Synod of Whitby, 664, at which the Catholic party, led  by the great Wilfrid, perhaps the greatest of all bishops of York,  defeated their opponents. After the council, Colman, then Bishop of  Lindisfarne, resigned, and his successor, Tuda by name, was killed with  many of his monks, by a pestilence at Lindisfarne. The ground therefore  seemed to be cleared for Wilfrid. At this time Oswy was king of  Bernicia, and Alchfrid his son governed Deira, probably as an  independent province. Alchfrid induced Wilfrid to accept the see of  York. Wilfrid at once set to work to strengthen the position of the  Catholic Church and to destroy the influence of the Church of Iona in  his diocese. He refused to be consecrated by a bishop of the Church of  Iona, sent for that purpose to Gaul. He probably was determined not to  acknowledge the supremacy of any other English see over his own. He was  absent for three years, and Oswy, who favoured the Church of Iona, took  advantage of his absence to appoint Ceadda (Chad) to the see of York. On  his return, after being duly consecrated, Wilfrid retired without a  struggle to his own monastery at Ripon. In 669, Theodore, the Archbishop  of Canterbury, intervened to make peace between the two factions, and at  his instigation Ceadda resigned the see in favour of Wilfrid, who at  once began his great period of activity in the diocese. Whatever may be  our sentimental liking for the older and more national Church of Iona,  there can be no doubt that the Catholic Church was the chief support of  culture, learning, and civilisation in Europe, and Wilfrid was a worthy  representative of it. During his episcopate the see of York probably  played the most important part it has ever taken in the history of  England. At that time, more than any other, the future of learning,  civilisation, and humanity was in the hands of the priests, and the  English _toto divisi ab orbe_ were kept in touch with the slowly  reviving culture of Europe by the cosmopolitan Church of Rome. Wilfrid  was undoubtedly the best representative of that culture in England. It  was his object not only to Catholicise the north of England, but to  educate it. He travelled continually through his vast diocese with a  train of builders, artists, and teachers. His architectural activity in  particular was very great. He repaired the minster at York, which had  fallen almost into ruins, and built large churches at Hexham and Ripon.  But he was not allowed to continue his work unopposed. Egfrith had  become king of the whole of Northumbria, and a quarrel arose between him  and Wilfrid. At last the king induced Theodore, who had formerly  interfered in Wilfrid's favour, but who was now perhaps jealous of his  great activity and fame, to assert his supremacy over the north and to  divide the great diocese of Northumbria into four bishoprics, York,  Lindisfarne, Hexham, and Witherne. Theodore had received the pall;  Wilfrid had not. It was therefore contended that Theodore had authority  over him. Wilfrid retired to Rome to claim the support of the Pope. It  was given to him, but when he returned to York, in 680, he was  imprisoned and afterwards banished. Soon after Egfrith died, and  Theodore, again intervening, obtained a reconciliation between Wilfrid  and the new king Alchfrid. Wilfrid again became Bishop of York, but  another quarrel caused him again to resign his see, and this time for  good. During all this period there is no doubt that the Bishops of York  were subordinate to those of Canterbury. The constant disorders to which  the kingdom of Northumbria was subjected for a century, and the quarrels  between bishop and king, lessened the power, both civil and  ecclesiastical, of the kingdom. It was not till 734 that a bishop of  York, Egbert, received the pall, which had been granted only to  Paulinus, and from that time the northern archbishops seem to have been  independent of Canterbury, especially after York fell into the hands of  the Danes in 867. It is possible that Gregory, who directed that York  and Canterbury should each appoint twelve suffragan bishops, intended to  make the sees equal in every respect. The anarchy and divisions of the  northern kingdom prevented this plan from being carried out. The kings  of Northumbria themselves, from time to time, acknowledged the authority  of Canterbury, and during the hundred years between Paulinus and Egbert  that York was without a metropolitan archbishop, the Primate of  Canterbury, without a rival, increased his power. With the advent of the  Danes, however, Northumbria was naturally much isolated from the south,  and the diocese of York, though smaller and poorer than that of  Canterbury, was a rival power. In fact, until the year 1072 the  archbishops of York either held themselves or appointed others to the  diocese of Worcester. It was not until the Conquest that the  independence of the northern bishops was seriously questioned. Under the  Danish rule two of the archbishops were probably of that race--Wolfstan,  appointed in 928, and Oskytel, his successor. The Danish supremacy was  put an end to in 954, when Eadred incorporated Northumbria into the  kingdom of England. From 867 to 1000, or after, York was ruled by an  earl, either under the Danes or the kings of England. The city was  important, not only as a strongly fortified place, but as a centre of  commerce, and it had a large population. It had as many as 30,000  inhabitants in the tenth century. There are traces of the Danish  supremacy in the language and faces of the people; in York itself Danish  beads, glass, jet and amber, and carved horns have been found.    At the time of the Conquest, Aeldred was archbishop of York. After  Hastings he swore allegiance to William. For this act he was bitterly  reproached. It is said that he exacted a promise from William that he  would treat his English and his Norman subjects alike. He crowned  William at Westminster. In 1068 Edwin and Morcar, Earls of Mercia and  Yorkshire, broke into rebellion. They soon submitted, but the people of  York had been roused, and remained in rebellion. On the approach of the  Conqueror, however, they also submitted."]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19423"],[0,"The Story of Porcelain (#3)"],[1," and  moreover, some of the very dishes themselves.\"    Theo seemed astonished.    \"Later the Romans made much beautiful pottery; but it was never as  beautiful as that of the Greeks. Sometime, however, Theo, you should  go to one of our museums and see some Samian ware, the finest of Roman  clay work. The red in it is almost as vivid as sealing-wax, and it has  a wonderful polish not unlike that on modern Egyptian ware. No one has  ever been able to discover from what clay this marvelous pottery was  made. Some historians think the ware was first made by wandering  Greek artisans. The Romans also made a very beautiful black ware now  known as Upchurch pottery because of the location in England in which  it was found. This black color, scientists have decided, was not  produced by mixing a pigment with the clay as did the Greeks, but  resulted from an ingenious use of oxide of iron which, when burned by  a reducing fire, turned black; the Romans also gave us Castor ware, a  pottery moulded from a dark clay and having on it figures traced in a  lighter color.\"    \"Did anybody else in Europe make as beautiful pottery as the Greeks  and Romans?\" inquired Theo.    \"Perhaps not so beautiful,\" answered Mr. Croyden. \"Yet before we hear  either of Greek or Roman we find the Egyptians and Assyrians, nations  famous for their skill in the arts as well as their prowess in war,  making pottery and tiles. These have been preserved to us in tombs  and pyramids, for these races, you know, were accustomed to pay great  honor to their dead. It was a fortunate custom, too, since by means of  it much history has come down to us which would otherwise have been  destroyed. Unquestionably the Saxons, Scandinavians, Gauls, and  Teutons also made pottery, but their attempts were of a cruder  sort. Dishes, vases, toys have been exhumed in their countries, all  displaying characteristic clay designs. But no country in the world  has ever equaled the pottery of the Greeks.\"    \"Did the Greeks----\" began Theo; but his father cut him short.    \"See here, young man,\" he declared, drawing out his watch, \"this is no  time of night for you to be setting forth on a history of Greek  pottery. You are going to bed.\"    [Illustration: \"I HAD FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT BED\"]    Theo rose with a laugh.    \"I had forgotten all about bed,\" he said.    \"That speaks pretty well for your charm as an historian, Croyden,\"  observed Dr. Swift. \"The boy could scarcely keep his eyes open at  dinner.\"    \"Can't you tell me about Greek pottery some other time, sir?\" asked  Theo.    \"I'd be glad to, sonny,\" Mr. Croyden returned. \"I never dreamed a boy  would be interested in such a dull subject.\"    \"It isn't dull when you tell it,\" came naively from Theo.    \"That is the biggest compliment I ever had in my life,\" exclaimed the  fisherman with pleasure. \"You shall hear more of Greek pottery  to-morrow if by that time you still want to. Good-night. The most  beautiful thing I can wish you is that you dream of Greek vases all  night long.\"          [Illustration]          CHAPTER II    MR. CROYDEN KEEPS HIS PROMISE      When Theo awoke the next day the novelty of his surroundings drove  every thought of Greek pottery from his mind. As he peeped out of his  window he could see slanting rifts of early sunlight flecking with  gold the trunks of the great pines. From the chimney of the  cookhouse a spiral of blue smoke was ascending and as it rose it  carried into the air with it a pleasant odor of burning wood and  frying bacon.    Theo did not dally with his dressing, you may be sure; he was far too  hungry, and too eager to attack the program for the day.    \"Put on thick boots, son,\" called Dr. Swift from his room. \"The  weather is fine. It is an ideal morning to tramp across Owl's Nest  Carry and fish in the lake beyond there.\"    \"What time is it, Father?\" inquired Theo. \"I forgot to wind my watch  last night.\"    \"Six o'clock. We shall have a three mile walk, and plenty of time to  get in some fishing before the sun is high. Then we can paddle  up-stream to the camp at the farther end of Owl Lake and cook our  lunch. How does that plan please you?\"    \"Hurrah!\" cried Theo. \"Is there a camp like this over there?\"    \"Oh, no. Just a lean-to which serves as a shelter, if people want to  spend the night and be on hand for early morning fishing. Sometimes,  too, I have gone over in the late afternoon and fished until dark,  afterward turning in on the pine boughs for the night. It is only a  crude little camp, but it is perfectly comfortable. You will like Owl  Lake. It is smaller than this one, but it has a very pretty shore  bordered with a stretch of white sandy beach.\"    \"It must be a great place for swimming.\"    \"It is. Just now, however, the water is too cold. Later in the season  when things get warmed up it is the finest bathing place  imaginable. Are you ready for breakfast now?\"    \"Yes, sir.\"    \"Then you'd better run along. I will join you in a few moments. I must  go first and see Manuel about the lunch.\"    \"All right, sir.\"    Through the crisp morning air Theo bounded across to the dining-cabin,  where he found Mr. Croyden.    A bright fire burned on the hearth and the table with its heaping  plates of hot johnny-cake looked most inviting.    \"Hello, youngster!\" called the older man, glancing up with a  smile. \"How do you find yourself to-day? All lamed up after your jolt  over the carry?\"    \"Not a bit, Mr. Croyden,\" laughed Theo. \"I'm not lame at all. I'm just  hungry.\"    \"A perfectly normal condition. So long as you can eat I guess there is  not much the matter with you.\"    \"Oh, I can always eat,\" grinned Theo. \"Mother says my appetite never  goes back on me.\"    \"Well, fall to. It looks as if Franz had prepared for the worst,\"  chuckled Mr. Croyden. \"What are you and your dad up to to-day?\"    \"We are going to Owl Lake to fish.\"    \"That isn't a bad beginning. It is not a long tramp, and the fish are  biting well over there. I have tried it several times and had  excellent luck. You are wise to start in gradually and not attempt  too long a jaunt at first. There is everything in getting into  training, as your father well knows.\"    There was a bang of the door, and Dr. Swift entered.    \"Good-morning, Doctor,\" said Mr. Croyden. \"So you and your son are to  try your skill at Owl to-day?\"    \"Yes. That seemed to be a good starter.\"    \"An excellent one.\"    \"Why don't you come along with us?\"    \"I?\"    \"Yes; that is, unless you have other plans. We should be glad to have  you. The more the merrier.\"    \"I wish you would come, Mr. Croyden,\" urged Theo.    \"That is very kind of you,\" returned Mr. Croyden, hesitating a  little. \"I had not planned my day. Are you sure you want so many?\"    \"Three is not many. Come along, by all means,\" declared  Dr. Swift. \"Manuel says the lake has not yet been fished much and that  the trout are biting well. Get Tony, your guide, to pack up your  tackle and bring some lunch. I am afraid we have not enough for all  hands.\"    Mr. Croyden sprang to his feet.    \"I'll do that,\" he replied. \"What time are you starting?\"    \"Just as soon as I have succeeded in getting Theo to take a little  nourishment,\" returned the Doctor.    This task Dr. Swift evidently did not find difficult, for within a  half hour the party were setting forth through the woods.    The luncheon, tackle, and sweaters had been put into a canoe, which  Tony and Manuel raised to their shoulders as if it were a feather.    \"There is a punt over at Owl that we can use, so we shall need only  one canoe,\" explained Manuel as he strode along.    The carry was not a rough one, but to Theo, accustomed to the  smoothness of city pavements, it seemed very rough indeed. He was  continually stepping into holes or climbing over fallen tree-trunks,  and although a good walker, the pace the guides set made him  pant. Even Dr. Swift was forced to confess that he was out of breath  and was obliged now and then to stop and rest. Mr. Croyden, on the  contrary, swung along the narrow trail with the ease of an Indian.    \"You will get into trim in a few days,\" he observed encouragingly to  Theo. \"I myself am always stiff and slow until I get limbered up.\"    When, however, Owl Lake finally came into sight both Theo and his  father instantly forgot their fatigue.    There stretched the tiny sheet of water, a gem of flashing blue whose  calm surface mirrored the pines and delicate birches bordering its  margin.    The punt and canoe were launched, the tackle unpacked, and amid a  silence broken only by the dip of oar and paddle the fishermen drifted  out into the stillness.    Ah, it was a day never to be forgotten! Certainly Theo would never  forget it, for it was during the first half-hour of this Arabian  Night's dream that he proudly landed a beautiful lake trout, the first  one he had ever caught.    From the moment he felt the tug at his line until his catch was safely  in the bottom of the boat his excitement was tremendous. How the  little creature pulled! How it swept away with the bait into deep  water! With Manuel, Dr. Swift, Tony, and Mr. Croyden all coaching  him, and almost as frenzied as he, poor Theo hardly knew where he  was. But he obeyed the insistent command of: \"_Play him! Play him!_\"  and play him he did. Even with the captive's final leap into the air  the trout did not succeed in freeing itself from the hook. Keeping his  prize well away from the boat that the line might not slacken Theo at  last reeled in his victim.    He gasped when the feat was accomplished.    The second time he knew better what to do; and before the sun was high  and the fish had ceased to bite he landed five beauties.    In the meantime both his father and Mr. Croyden had been so absorbed  in watching his pleasure that they had almost forgotten their own  lines, and it was not until a big land-loch struck that the Doctor  remembered he, too, was fishing.
