AN INDIAN RAID          Did you see some Indians passing,        Just a short while back?      Looks as if they must be massing        For a fierce attack!        Buckskin fringes, turkey-feather        Huge head-dresses and      Bows and arrows, altogether        Quite a frightful band!        From the lilac-bushes springing,        See them rushing! Ugh!      Awful war-whoops wildly ringing!        There'll be scalping, too!        In their fearful frenzy leaping,        It is very plain      Soon around us they'll be heaping        Mountains of the slain!        Soon their victims will be falling--        But, above the noise,      Hark! I hear somebody calling,        \"Come to dinner, boys!\"          THE FIRST SLEIGH-RIDE          O happy time of fleecy rime        And falling flakes, and O      The glad surprise in baby eyes        That never saw the snow!        Down shining ways the flying sleighs        Go jingling by, and see!      Beside the gate the horses wait        And neigh for you and me!          SLEEPY TIME          Hey, baby! Ho, baby! here upon my knee,      See the firelight flicker over you and me!        See the tiny people basking in the glow,      Peering through the ruddy little coals, and so        How they dance and scamper! Merry fairy folk!      Little sparks for spangles, little wings of smoke!        Come baby, come baby, nestle in my arms;      Hear the purring flames now sing their sleepy charms.        All the firelight fairies, all the drowsy elves,      In the downy ashes cover up themselves.        And I fold the little blanket over you;      Bye baby, my baby, let us slumber too.          WHEN BETTIE AND ANNE WENT WALKING              When they took their dollies walking,          They were both so busy talking,      (They had not met for half an hour and so had much to say)          That they heedlessly kept going          Down the shady streets, not knowing,      Till they wanted to come back again, they could not find the way!            In their fright they felt forlorner          Every time they turned a corner,      And they wailed to one another, \"Oh, whatever shall we do?          A big bear might come to bite us,          Or a dreadful dog to fight us,      Or the wicked gipsies get us! _Oh, boo-hoo! Boo-hoo! Boo-hoo!_\"            But this story, though a sad one,          Has an end that's not a bad one,      For at last somebody found them as they bade the world good-by;          They took their dollies home again,          And vowed they'd never roam again,      And their mothers hugged and kissed them, saying, \"There, my dears,              don't cry!\"          THE BLUEBIRD          To-day at dawn there twinkled through      The pearly mist a flash of blue        So dazzling bright I thought the sky        Shone through the rifted clouds on high,                Till, by and by,      A note so honey-sweet I heard,      I knew that bright flash was a bird!          THE ORGAN-GRINDER          Hark! I hear the organ-grinder        Coming down the street,      And the sudden clatter-patter        Of the children's feet!        Come, oh, let us run to meet him!        Did you ever hear      Tunes so gay as he is playing,        Or so sweet and clear?        See the brown-faced little monkey,        Impudent and bold,      With his little scarlet jacket        Braided all in gold!        And his tiny cap and tassel        Bobbing to and fro,      Look, oh, look! he plucks it off now,        Bowing very low.        And he's passing it politely--        Can it be for _pay_?      O dear me! I have no penny!        Let us run away!          THE NEW MOON          Pretty new moon, little new moon,        Now, as first I look at you,      I must make a wish, for wise folks        Say it surely will come true!        Little new moon, pretty new moon,        I wish--but I must not tell!      For if any one should hear it,        Wise folks say it breaks the spell!          SHOWERY TIME          The April rain-drops tinkle        In cuckoo-cups of gold,      And warm south winds unwrinkle        The buds the peach-boughs hold.        In countless fluted creases        The little elm-leaves show,      While white as carded fleeces        The dogwood blossoms blow.        A rosy robe is wrapping        The early red-bud trees;      But still the haws are napping,        Nor heed the honey-bees.        And still in lazy sleeping        The apple-buds are bound,      But tulip-tips are peeping        From out the garden ground.        And yonder, gayly swinging        Upon the turning vane,      A robin redbreast singing        Makes merry at the rain!          EASTER DAY          Christ the Lord is risen to-day!      Angels rolled the stone away      From the tomb wherein He lay!        Little children, come and sing,      \"Glory, glory to the King,      Christ the Lord of everything!\"          THE SANDMAN          The Sandman! hark, I hear him!        He's coming up the stair,      And everybody near him        Is nodding, I declare!        He's peeping in the door now,        And first of all he spies,      As he has done before now,        The little children's eyes!        Then quickly does he throw it,        His golden sleepy-sand,      And all, before they know it,        Are off for sleepy-land!          DANDELION CURLS          Ah, ha, ha, now! who comes here      Wreathed in flowers of gold and queer      Tiny tangled curls of green      Gayly bobbing in between?        Pretty token of the spring!      Hark! we hear the bluebirds sing      When we thus see little girls      Decked in dandelion curls.          POP-CORN                   _Pop! Pop!--Poppetty-pop!_      Shake and rattle and rattle and shake      The golden grains as they bounce and break      To fluffy puffiness--_Poppetty-pop!_      Bursting and banging the popper's top!               _Poppetty-pop!                    Pop! Pop!_        The yellow kernels, oh, see them grow      White as cotton or flakes of snow!                 _Pop! Pop!_      O-ho, how they frolic and fly about      And turn themselves suddenly inside out!      _Pop-pop-poppetty! Pop-pop-pop!_      The popper's full and we'll have to stop;      Pile the bowl with the tempting treat,      Children, come, it is time to eat!          THE RASH LITTLE SPARROW            Rash little sparrow          Up in the nest;      Feathers not long enough,      Wee wings not strong enough!          Poor little sparrow!          Poor little breast!          WHAT IF?          When I see the new moon lightly       Through cloud ripples slip,      Then I'm sure that shining brightly       It's a fairy ship!        What if in it we were sailing       Far and far away,      With a wake of silver trailing,       Till the golden day?        Why, we'd fly back home together       Safely from the sky,      For the moon's a fairy feather       When the sun is high!          EASTER EGGS          Seven little nests of hay      We have made, for Easter day      Is to-morrow, and you know      We must have them ready, so      When the Rabbit comes she'll see      We expected her, that we      Children tried our very best      Each to make the nicest nest.        One is in the lilac-bush,      Near the ground--last year a thrush      Built a nest there--let me see,      Two are by the apple-tree,      In the clover--that makes three--      One beside the playhouse door,      --Three plus one, that must be four--      Two are in the tulip-bed--      Was it seven that I said?      Oh, yes! six I've counted, and      One is in our pile of sand.           *       *       *       *       *        Come and see! Oh, hurry, hurry!      For the Rabbit, kind and furry,      Has been here again and laid      Eggs in every nest we made!      Purple, orange, red, and blue,      Pink and green and yellow, too,      Like a bunch of finest flowers      Ever seen, and all are ours!      And oh, _look!_ What _do_ you think!      Here our names are in white ink,      All spelled nicely so we know      Just where every egg should go!      Is it not surprising, quite,      How well Easter Rabbits write?          THE BIRDS' BATH          In our garden we have made        Such a pretty little pool,      Lined with pebbles neatly laid,        Filled with water clean and cool.        [Illustration: THE BIRDS' BATH]        When the sun shines warm and high        Robins cluster round its brink,      Never one comes flying by        But will flutter down to drink.        Then they splash and splash and splash,        Spattering little showers bright      All around, till off they flash        Singing sweetly their delight.          NOVEMBER MORNING          A tingling, misty marvel        Blew hither in the night,      And now the little peach-trees        Are clasped in frozen light.        Upon the apple-branches        An icy film is caught,      With trailing threads of gossamer        In pearly patterns wrought.        The autumn sun, in wonder,        Is gayly peering through      This silver-tissued network        Across the frosty blue.        The weather-vane is fire-tipped,        The honeysuckle shows      A dazzling icy splendor,        And crystal is the rose.        Around the eaves are fringes        Of icicles that seem      To mock the summer rainbows        With many-colored gleam.        Along the walk, the pebbles        Are each a precious stone;      The grass is tasseled hoarfrost,        The clover jewel-sown.        Such sparkle, sparkle, sparkle        Fills all the frosty air,      Oh, can it be that darkness        Is ever anywhere!          THE RUNAWAY          A frantic clatter of horses' feet!      A runaway's coming down the street!            Flurry, scurry,            Children, hurry!      Drop your playthings! Quick! don't wait!

For a long while previously there had been war between Babylonia and the  \"Land of the Bow,\" whose rulers seem to have established themselves  in the city of Kis. At one time we find the Babylonian prince  En-sag(sag)-ana capturing Kis and its king; at another time it is a king  of Kis who makes offerings to the god of Nippur, in gratitude for his  victories. To this period belongs the famous \"Stela of the Vultures\"  found at Tello, on which is depicted the victory of E-dingir-ana-gin,  the King of Lagas (Tello), over the Semitic hordes of the Land of the  Bow. It may be noted that the recent discoveries have shown how correct  Professor Maspero has been in assigning the kings of Lagas to a period  earlier than that of Sargon of Akkad.    Professor Hilprecht would place E-dingir-ana-gin after Lugal-zaggisi,  and see in the Stela of the Vultures a monument of the revenge taken  by the Sumerian rulers of Lagas for the conquest of the country by the  inhabitants of the north. But it is equally possible that it marks  the successful reaction of Chaldsea against the power established by  Lugal-zaggisi. However this may be, the dynasty of Lagas (to which  Professor Hilprecht has added a new king, En-Khegal) reigned in peace  for some time, and belonged to the same age as the first dynasty of Ur.  This was founded by a certain Lugal-kigubnidudu, whose inscriptions have  been found at Niffer. The dynasty which arose at Ur in later days (cir.  b.c. 2700), under Ur-Gur and Bungi, which has hitherto been known as  \"the first dynasty of Ur,\" is thus dethroned from its position, and  becomes the second. The succeeding dynasty, which also made Ur its  capital, and whose kings, Ine-Sin, Pur-Sin IL, and Gimil-Sin, were  the immediate predecessors of the first dynasty of Babylon (to which  Kharnmurabi belonged), must henceforth be termed the third.    Among the latest acquisitions from Tello are the seals of the _patesi_,  Lugal-usumgal, which finally remove all doubt as to the identity of  \"Sargani, king of the city,\" with the famous Sargon of Akkad. The  historical accuracy of Sargon's annals, moreover, have been fully  vindicated. Not only have the American excavators found the contemporary  monuments of him and his son Naram-Sin, but also tablets dated in the  years of his campaigns against \"the land of the Amorites.\" In short,  Sargon of Akkad, so lately spoken of as \"a half-mythical\" personage, has  now emerged into the full glare of authentic history.    That the native chronologists had sufficient material for reconstructing  the past history of their country, is also now clear. The early  Babylonian contract-tablets are dated by events which officially  distinguished the several years of a king's reign, and tablets have been  discovered compiled at the close of a reign which give year by year the  events which thus characterised them. One of these tablets, for example,  from the excavations at Niffer, begins with the words: (1) \"The year  when Par-Sin (II.) becomes king. (2) The year when Pur-Sin the king  conquers Urbillum,\" and ends with \"the year when Gimil-Sin becomes King  of Ur, and conquers the land of Zabsali\" in the Lebanon.    Of special interest to the biblical student are the discoveries made  by Mr. Pinches among some of the Babylonian tablets which have recently  been acquired by the British Museum. Four of them relate to no less a  personage than Kudur-Laghghamar or Chedor-laomer, \"King of Elam,\" as  well as to Eri-Aku or Arioch, King of Larsa, and his son Dur-makh-ilani;  to Tudghula or Tidal, the son of Gazza[ni], and to their war against  Babylon in the time of Khamrnu[rabi]. In one of the texts the question  is asked, \"Who is the son of a king's daughter who has sat on the throne  of royalty? Dur-makh-ilani, the son of Eri-Aku, the son of the lady  Kur... has sat on the throne of royalty,\" from which it may perhaps be  inferred that Eri-Aku was the son of Kudur-Laghghamar's daughter; and in  another we read, \"Who is Kudur-Laghghamar, the doer of mischief? He  has gathered together the Umman Manda, has devastated the land of Bel  (Babylonia), and [has marched] at their side.\" The Umman Manda were the  \"Barbarian Hordes\" of the Kurdish mountains, on the northern frontier of  Elam, and the name corresponds with that of the Goyyim or \"nations\" in  the fourteenth chapter of Genesis. We here see Kudur-Laghghamar acting  as their suzerain lord. Unfortunately, all four tablets are in a  shockingly broken condition, and it is therefore difficult to discover  in them a continuous sense, or to determine their precise nature.    They have, however, been supplemented by further discoveries made by  Dr. Scheil at Constantinople. Among the tablets preserved there, he has  found letters from Kharnmurabi to his vassal Sin-idinnam of Larsa,  from which we learn that Sin-idinnam had been dethroned by the Elamites  Kudur-Mabug and Eri-Aku, and had fled for refuge to the court of  Kharnmurabi at Babylon. In the war which subsequently broke out between  Kharnmurabi and Kudur-Laghghamar, the King of Elam (who, it would seem,  exercised suzerainty over Babylonia for seven years), Sin-idinnam  gave material assistance to the Babylonian monarch, and Khammurabi  accordingly bestowed presents upon him as a \"recompense for his valour  on the day of the overthrow of Kudur-Laghghamar.\"    I must also refer to a fine scarab--found in the rubbish-mounds of the  ancient city of Kom Ombos, in Upper Egypt--which bears upon it the  name of Sutkhu-Apopi. It shows us that the author of the story of the  Expulsion of the Hyksos, in calling the king Ra-Apopi, merely, like an  orthodox Egyptian, substituted the name of the god of Heliopolis for  that of the foreign deity. Equally interesting are the scarabs brought  to light by Professor Flinders Petrie, on which a hitherto unknown  Ya'aqob-hal or Jacob-el receives the titles of a Pharaoh.    In volumes VII., VIII., and IX., Professor Maspero concludes his  monumental work on the history of the ancient East. The overthrow of the  Persian empire by the Greek soldiers of Alexander marks the beginning of  a new era. Europe at last enters upon the stage of history, and becomes  the heir of the culture and civilisation of the Orient. The culture  which had grown up and developed on the banks of the Euphrates and Nile  passes to the West, and there assumes new features and is inspired with  a new spirit. The East perishes of age and decrepitude; its strength is  outworn, its power to initiate is past. The long ages through which it  had toiled to build up the fabric of civilisation are at an end; fresh  races are needed to carry on the work which it had achieved. Greece  appears upon the scene, and behind Greece looms the colossal figure of  the Roman Empire.    During the past decade, excavation has gone on apace in Egypt and  Babylonia, and discoveries of a startling and unexpected nature have  followed in the wake of excavation. Ages that seemed prehistoric step  suddenly forth into the daydawn of history; personages whom a sceptical  criticism had consigned to the land of myth or fable are clothed once  more with flesh and blood, and events which had been long forgotten  demand to be recorded and described. In Babylonia, for example, the  excavations at Niffer and Tello have shown that Sargon of Akkad, so far  from being a creature of romance, was as much a historical monarch as  Nebuchadrezzar himself; monuments of his reign have been discovered, and  we learn from them that the empire he is said to have founded had a very  real existence. Contracts have been found dated in the years when he was  occupied in conquering Syria and Palestine, and a cadastral survey that  was made for the purposes of taxation mentions a Canaanite who had been  appointed \"governor of the land of the Amorites.\" Even a postal service  had already been established along the high-roads which knit the several  parts of the empire together, and some of the clay seals which franked  the letters are now in the Museum of the Louvre.    At Susa, M. de Morgan, the late director of the Service of Antiquities  in Egypt, has been excavating below the remains of the Achremenian  period, among the ruins of the ancient Elamite capital. Here he  has found numberless historical inscriptions, besides a text in  hieroglyphics which may cast light on the origin of the cuneiform  characters. But the most interesting of his discoveries are two  Babylonian monuments that were carried off by Elamite conquerors from  the cities of Babylonia. One of them is a long inscription of about 1200  lines belonging to Manistusu, one of the early Babylonian kings, whose  name has been met with at Niffer; the other is a monument of Naram-Sin,  the Son of Sargon of Akkad, which it seems was brought as booty to Susa  by Simti-silkhak, the grandfather, perhaps, of Eriaku or Arioch.    In Armenia, also, equally important inscriptions have been found by  Belck and Lehmann. More than two hundred new ones have been added to the  list of Vannic texts. It has been discovered from them that the kingdom  of Biainas or Van was founded by Ispuinis and Menuas, who rebuilt  Yan itself and the other cities which they had previously sacked and  destroyed. The older name of the country was Kumussu, and it may be that  the language spoken in it was allied to that of the Hittites, since a  tablet in hieroglyphics of the Hittite type has been unearthed at Toprak  Kaleh. One of the newly-found inscriptions of Sarduris III. shows that  the name of the Assyrian god, hitherto read Ramman or Rimmon, was  really pronounced Hadad. It describes a war of the Vannic king against  Assur-nirari, son of Hadad-nirari (_A-da-di-ni-ra-ri_) of Assyria, thus  revealing not only the true form of the Assyrian name, but also the  parentage of the last king of the older Assyrian dynasty.
