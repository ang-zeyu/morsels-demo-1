Yet,  hard as conditions were in Gavrillac, they were not so hard as in many  other parts of France, not half so hard, for instance, as with the  wretched feudatories of the great Lord of La Tour d'Azyr, whose vast  possessions were at one point separated from this little village by the  waters of the Meu.    The Chateau de Gavrillac owed such seigneurial airs as might be claimed  for it to its dominant position above the village rather than to any  feature of its own. Built of granite, like all the rest of Gavrillac,  though mellowed by some three centuries of existence, it was a squat,  flat-fronted edifice of two stories, each lighted by four windows with  external wooden shutters, and flanked at either end by two square towers  or pavilions under extinguisher roofs. Standing well back in a garden,  denuded now, but very pleasant in summer, and immediately fronted by a  fine sweep of balustraded terrace, it looked, what indeed it was, and  always had been, the residence of unpretentious folk who found more  interest in husbandry than in adventure.    Quintin de Kercadiou, Lord of Gavrillac--Seigneur de Gavrillac was all  the vague title that he bore, as his forefathers had borne before him,  derived no man knew whence or how--confirmed the impression that his  house conveyed. Rude as the granite itself, he had never sought the  experience of courts, had not even taken service in the armies of his  King. He left it to his younger brother, Etienne, to represent the  family in those exalted spheres. His own interests from earliest years  had been centred in his woods and pastures. He hunted, and he cultivated  his acres, and superficially he appeared to be little better than any of  his rustic metayers. He kept no state, or at least no state commensurate  with his position or with the tastes of his niece Aline de Kercadiou.  Aline, having spent some two years in the court atmosphere of Versailles  under the aegis of her uncle Etienne, had ideas very different from  those of her uncle Quintin of what was befitting seigneurial dignity.  But though this only child of a third Kercadiou had exercised, ever  since she was left an orphan at the early age of four, a tyrannical rule  over the Lord of Gavrillac, who had been father and mother to her, she  had never yet succeeded in beating down his stubbornness on that  score. She did not yet despair--persistence being a dominant note in  her character--although she had been assiduously and fruitlessly at work  since her return from the great world of Versailles some three months  ago.    She was walking on the terrace when Andre-Louis and M. de Vilmorin  arrived. Her slight body was wrapped against the chill air in a white  pelisse; her head was encased in a close-fitting bonnet, edged with  white fur. It was caught tight in a knot of pale-blue ribbon on the  right of her chin; on the left a long ringlet of corn-coloured hair had  been permitted to escape. The keen air had whipped so much of her cheeks  as was presented to it, and seemed to have added sparkle to eyes that  were of darkest blue.    Andre-Louis and M. de Vilmorin had been known to her from childhood. The  three had been playmates once, and Andre-Louis--in view of his spiritual  relationship with her uncle--she called her cousin. The cousinly  relations had persisted between these two long after Philippe de  Vilmorin had outgrown the earlier intimacy, and had become to her  Monsieur de Vilmorin.    She waved her hand to them in greeting as they advanced, and stood--an  entrancing picture, and fully conscious of it--to await them at the end  of the terrace nearest the short avenue by which they approached.    \"If you come to see monsieur my uncle, you come inopportunely,  messieurs,\" she told them, a certain feverishness in her air. \"He is  closely--oh, so very closely--engaged.\"    \"We will wait, mademoiselle,\" said M. de Vilmorin, bowing gallantly over  the hand she extended to him. \"Indeed, who would haste to the uncle that  may tarry a moment with the niece?\"    \"M. l'abbe,\" she teased him, \"when you are in orders I shall take you  for my confessor. You have so ready and sympathetic an understanding.\"    \"But no curiosity,\" said Andre-Louis. \"You haven't thought of that.\"    \"I wonder what you mean, Cousin Andre.\"    \"Well you may,\" laughed Philippe. \"For no one ever knows.\" And then,  his glance straying across the terrace settled upon a carriage that was  drawn up before the door of the chateau. It was a vehicle such as was  often to be seen in the streets of a great city, but rarely in the  country. It was a beautifully sprung two-horse cabriolet of walnut,  with a varnish upon it like a sheet of glass and little pastoral scenes  exquisitely painted on the panels of the door. It was built to carry two  persons, with a box in front for the coachman, and a stand behind for  the footman. This stand was empty, but the footman paced before the  door, and as he emerged now from behind the vehicle into the range of M.  de Vilmorin's vision, he displayed the resplendent blue-and-gold livery  of the Marquis de La Tour d'Azyr.    \"Why!\" he exclaimed. \"Is it M. de La Tour d'Azyr who is with your  uncle?\"    \"It is, monsieur,\" said she, a world of mystery in voice and eyes, of  which M. de Vilmorin observed nothing.    \"Ah, pardon!\" he bowed low, hat in hand. \"Serviteur, mademoiselle,\" and  he turned to depart towards the house.    \"Shall I come with you, Philippe?\" Andre-Louis called after him.    \"It would be ungallant to assume that you would prefer it,\" said M. de  Vilmorin, with a glance at mademoiselle. \"Nor do I think it would serve.  If you will wait...\"    M. de Vilmorin strode off. Mademoiselle, after a moment's blank pause,  laughed ripplingly. \"Now where is he going in such a hurry?\"    \"To see M. de La Tour d'Azyr as well as your uncle, I should say.\"    \"But he cannot. They cannot see him. Did I not say that they are  very closely engaged? You don't ask me why, Andre.\" There was an arch  mysteriousness about her, a latent something that may have been elation  or amusement, or perhaps both. Andre-Louis could not determine it.    \"Since obviously you are all eagerness to tell, why should I ask?\" quoth  he.    \"If you are caustic I shall not tell you even if you ask. Oh, yes, I  will. It will teach you to treat me with the respect that is my due.\"    \"I hope I shall never fail in that.\"    \"Less than ever when you learn that I am very closely concerned in the  visit of M. de La Tour d'Azyr. I am the object of this visit.\" And she  looked at him with sparkling eyes and lips parted in laughter.    \"The rest, you would seem to imply, is obvious. But I am a dolt, if you  please; for it is not obvious to me.\"    \"Why, stupid, he comes to ask my hand in marriage.\"    \"Good God!\" said Andre-Louis, and stared at her, chapfallen.    She drew back from him a little with a frown and an upward tilt of her  chin. \"It surprises you?\"    \"It disgusts me,\" said he, bluntly. \"In fact, I don't believe it. You  are amusing yourself with me.\"    For a moment she put aside her visible annoyance to remove his doubts.  \"I am quite serious, monsieur. There came a formal letter to my uncle  this morning from M. de La Tour d'Azyr, announcing the visit and its  object. I will not say that it did not surprise us a little...\"    \"Oh, I see,\" cried Andre-Louis, in relief. \"I understand. For a moment I  had almost feared...\" He broke off, looked at her, and shrugged.    \"Why do you stop? You had almost feared that Versailles had been wasted  upon me. That I should permit the court-ship of me to be conducted like  that of any village wench. It was stupid of you. I am being sought in  proper form, at my uncle's hands.\"    \"Is his consent, then, all that matters, according to Versailles?\"    \"What else?\"    \"There is your own.\"    She laughed. \"I am a dutiful niece... when it suits me.\"    \"And will it suit you to be dutiful if your uncle accepts this monstrous  proposal?\"    \"Monstrous!\" She bridled. \"And why monstrous, if you please?\"    \"For a score of reasons,\" he answered irritably.    \"Give me one,\" she challenged him.    \"He is twice your age.\"    \"Hardly so much,\" said she.    \"He is forty-five, at least.\"    \"But he looks no more than thirty. He is very handsome--so much you will  admit; nor will you deny that he is very wealthy and very powerful; the  greatest nobleman in Brittany. He will make me a great lady.\"    \"God made you that, Aline.\"    \"Come, that's better. Sometimes you can almost be polite.\" And she moved  along the terrace, Andre-Louis pacing beside her.    \"I can be more than that to show reason why you should not let this  beast befoul the beautiful thing that God has made.\"    She frowned, and her lips tightened. \"You are speaking of my future  husband,\" she reproved him.    His lips tightened too; his pale face grew paler.    \"And is it so? It is settled, then? Your uncle is to agree? You are to  be sold thus, lovelessly, into bondage to a man you do not know. I had  dreamed of better things for you, Aline.\"    \"Better than to be Marquise de La Tour d'Azyr?\"    He made a gesture of exasperation. \"Are men and women nothing more than  names? Do the souls of them count for nothing? Is there no joy in life,  no happiness, that wealth and pleasure and empty, high-sounding titles  are to be its only aims? I had set you high--so high, Aline--a thing  scarce earthly. There is joy in your heart, intelligence in your mind;  and, as I thought, the vision that pierces husks and shams to claim the  core of reality for its own. Yet you will surrender all for a parcel of  make-believe. You will sell your soul and your body to be Marquise de La  Tour d'Azyr.\"    \"You are indelicate,\" said she, and though she frowned her eyes laughed.  \"And you go headlong to conclusions. My uncle will not consent to more  than to allow my consent to be sought. We understand"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19487"],[0,"Bell's Cathedrals: The Cathedral Church of Hereford (#3)"],[1,"that the Bishop of Worcester,  his great-uncle, asked him as a child as to his choice of a profession,  and that he answered he would like to be a soldier. \"Then, sweetheart,\"  his uncle is said to have exclaimed, \"thou shalt be a soldier to serve the  King of Kings, and fight under the banner of the glorious martyr, St.  Thomas.\" Regular attendance at mass was his custom from earliest years.  Both at Oxford and Paris he distinguished himself, gaining his degree of  M.A. at the Sorbonne, and on his return accepted, at the request of the  university of Oxford and with the consent of the King, the office of  chancellor. In this capacity he showed singular courage and determination  in repressing a brawl between the southern scholars and those of the  north, in which we are told he escaped with a whole skin, but not with a  whole coat.    He was chosen to fill the post of Chancellor of England under Simon de  Montfort, at whose death, however, he was deprived of the office. It was  some years after this that he became Bishop of Hereford, and was  consecrated at Canterbury, September 8th, 1275. No Welsh bishop attended  the consecration.    After he became a bishop he still wore his hair-shirt and showed ever  intense devotion in his celebration of divine service. He was remarkable  in the steadfastness and ability he displayed in maintaining the rights of  the see. Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, claiming a certain \"chace\"  near Malvern Forest, whence came the Bishop's supply of game, found a  relentless opponent in Bishop Cantilupe. The Bishop was prepared with the  customary \"pugil\" or champion (who received 6s. 8d. per annum), though his  services were not required. The Earl was excommunicated, and appealing to  the law in a trial Bishop Cantilupe eloquently maintained his right to  capture \"buck, doe, fawn, wild cat, hare, and all birds pertaining  thereto,\" and as a result of the verdict being in his favour, caused a  long trench to be dug on the crest of the Malvern Hills as a boundary  line, which is still traceable.    Llewellyn, King of Wales, was made to restore three manors of which he had  obtained unlawful possession; and Lord Clifford, for cattle-lifting and  maltreating the Bishop's tenants, was compelled to walk barefoot to the  high altar in the cathedral, while the Bishop personally chastised him  with a rod.    Many cases did he fight out successfully, but his greatest struggle was on  a question of testamentary jurisdiction with Peckham, Archbishop of  Canterbury, by whom he was ultimately excommunicated and obliged to leave  the country, attended by Swinfield, his faithful chaplain.    He obtained a decree in his favour from Pope Martin IV., but died on the  homeward journey on August 25th, 1282. He was buried in the church of St.  Severus, near Florence; but his bones having been divided from the flesh  by boiling, were later carried to England and solemnly placed in the Lady  Chapel of the cathedral. It is said that the Earl of Gloucester, with whom  Bishop Cantilupe had had the dispute about the chace, attended the  ceremony, and that blood began to flow from the bones when he approached  the casket containing them; upon which the Earl immediately restored the  property he had taken unjustly from the church.    Forty years later Bishop Cantilupe was canonised. It is said, amongst  other evidences of his saintliness, that he never allowed his sister to  kiss him. Three hundred sick people are said to have been cured at the  place of his interment, and so many candles were presented by the crowds  of visitors that Luke de Bray, the treasurer of the cathedral, had a  dispute with the prebendaries as to the value of the wax, two-thirds being  finally assigned to the treasurer and one-third to the prebendaries.    After five years Bishop Cantilupe's bones were removed to the Chapel of  St. Katherine, in the north-west transept, on Maundy Thursday, April 6th,  1287, in presence of King Edward I. They were again twice moved in the  sixteenth century to the Lady Chapel and back again to the north-west  transept.    The building of the chapter-house may have spread over some part of  Cantilupe's episcopate, and probably part of the cloisters were erected  about this time.    The miracles said to have been wrought at the shrine of St. Cantilupe are  both many and various. More than sixty-six dead people are said to have  been restored to life. The saint's intervention appears to have been  extended even to animals, as we find that King Edward I. twice sent sick  falcons to be cured at this tomb. So great was the reverence for the saint  that the See of Hereford was allowed by the Crown to change its armorial  bearings for the arms of Cantilupe, which all its bishops have since  borne.    Bishop Cantilupe was succeeded by his devoted chaplain, Richard Swinfield,  an excellent preacher and a man of agreeable manners. Bishop Swinfield,  like his predecessor, stoutly vindicated the rights and discipline of his  diocese, once against a layman for taking forcible possession of a vacant  benefice, another time against a lady for imprisoning a young clergyman in  her castle on a false charge, and also against the people of Ludlow for  violating the right of sanctuary, and in many cases against abuses of all  sorts. On one occasion Pontius de Cors, a nephew of Bishop Aquablanca, who  had obtained from the Pope the provision of the prebend of Hinton,  interrupted the installation of Robert de Shelving appointed by Bishop  Swinfield, gained admission to the cathedral with an accomplice, and was  formally installed by him in spite of the remonstrance of the Chapter. He  held his place by force of arms during that day and the next, but later  submitted to the Bishop.    Bishop Swinfield was probably the builder of the nave-aisles and of the  two easternmost transepts. This amounted to a remodelling of the work of  De Vere. The bases of his piers and responds were retained and may still  be seen, and upon the former octagonal columns were erected to carry the  vaulting. The windows were altered throughout. It was in his time that the  \"_Mappa Mundi_,\" the curious map of the world designed by Richard of  Haldingham of Battle in Sussex, a prebendary of Hereford in 1305, now  preserved in the cathedral, came into possession of the Chapter.    Richard Haldingham was a great friend of Bishop Swinfield, and when it was  necessary for him to send representatives to a provincial Council in  London, A.D. 1313, Haldingham was deputed to attend with Adam of Orleton,  a place belonging to the Mortimers of Wigmore in the north-east of  Herefordshire.    Three years later (1316), on the death of Bishop Swinfield at his chief  residence, Bosbury, Adam of Orleton succeeded him in the bishopric.    King Edward II. was not jubilant over the appointment of a friend of Roger  Mortimer to this important position, and, failing to persuade Adam to  decline the bishopric, he appealed to the Pope, begging him to cancel the  appointment, but with no more success. The fortunes of the Bishop of  Hereford became identified with the Queen, whom he joined on her return  from France with her eldest son. It was at Hereford that this youth, then  fourteen years of age, was appointed guardian of the kingdom under the  direction of his mother.    The King, who had sought refuge in Wales, was captured at Neath Abbey, and  the great seal taken from him by Bishop Adam Orleton, while the  Chancellor, Hugh Despenser, was conveyed to Hereford, where he was crowned  with nettles and dressed in a shirt upon which was written passages from  Psalm lii. beginning, \"Why boastest thou thyself, thou tyrant: that thou  canst do mischief.\" Amid the howlings of a great multitude who mocked his  name by shrieking \"Hue!\" he was finally hanged on a gallows 50 feet high  and then quartered. Among the prisoners were two wearing holy orders, and  these the Bishop of Hereford claimed as his perquisite.      [Illustration: A GARGOYLE IN THE CLOISTERS. DRAWN BY A. HUGH FISHER.]              A GARGOYLE IN THE CLOISTERS. DRAWN BY A. HUGH FISHER.      Bishop Adam, wary, unscrupulous, but at the same time vigorous and of  unusual ability, played a great part in politics to the end of the  wretched King's life. Some historians still believe that he recommended  the murder; he certainly supported the deposition in Parliament, and went  to Kenilworth as one of the commissioners to force the King's resignation.  If thus interested in secular politics, he was no less watchful and  vigilant in the affairs of his bishopric and the cathedral.    The great central tower, destined centuries later to be a source of such  anxiety and a problem of such difficulty to the restorer, was even at this  early date showing signs of dilapidation, and Bishop Orleton obtained from  Pope John XXII. a grant of the great tithes of Shenyngfeld (Swinfield) and  Swalefeld (Swallowfield) in Berkshire, in answer to the following  petition:--\"That they, being desirous of rebuilding a portion of the fabric  of the Church of Hereford, had caused much super-structure of sumptuous  work to be built, to the adornment of the House of God, upon an ancient  foundation; which in the judgment of masons or architects, who were  considered skilful in their art, was thought to be firm and sound, at the  cost of 20,000 marcs sterling and more, and that on account of the  weakness of the aforesaid foundation, the building, which was placed upon  it now, threatened such ruin, that by a similar judgment no other remedy  could be applied short of an entire renovation of the fabric from the  foundation,--which, on account of the expenses incurred in prosecution of  the canonisation of Thomas de Cantilupe, Bishop of Hereford, of blessed  memory, they were unable to undertake.\" The \"sumptuous work\" alluded to  was evidently the central tower and the north transept; which latter had  been built, as mentioned before, for "]]]
