[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21656"],[0,"The Princess of the School (#3)"],[1," this wretched little shop in the village!\"    \"Except bacon and kippers!\" grinned Roland.    \"I can't knit with kippers!\"    \"Fact is, we're all bored stiff!\" drawled Everard from the sofa,  flinging away the book he was reading, and stretching his arms in the  luxury of a long-drawn yawn. \"What should you say to a turn in the car?  Wouldn't it be rather sport, don't you think?\"    \"If Grandfather would spare Milner to take us!\" said Lilias doubtfully.    \"We don't want Milner. _I'll_ drive you! I can manage a car as well as  he can, any day. Don't get excited, you kids! _No_, Bevis, I shall  certainly _not_ allow you to try to drive! There's only going to be one  man at that job, and that's myself!\"    \"Shall we go and ask Grandfather?\" suggested Dulcie.    \"Right you are! No, not the whole of us,\" (as there was a general family  move). \"Three's enough!\"    So a deputation, consisting of Everard, Lilias, and Dulcie, promptly  presented themselves at the study door and tapped for admission. As  there was no reply to a second rap, they opened the door and walked into  the room. Grandfather was rather deaf, and sometimes, when he had  ignored a summons, he would say: \"Well, why didn't you come in?\" He was  generally to be found writing letters at this hour in the morning, but  to-day the revolving chair was empty. He had apparently begun his usual  correspondence, for his desk was littered with papers. Leaning up  against the ink-pot there was a photograph. The young people, who had  walked across the room towards the window, could not fail to notice it,  for it was tilted in such a prominent place that it at once attracted  their attention. It represented a very pretty dark-eyed young lady,  holding a baby on her lap, with a slight background of Greek columns.  The decidedly foreign look about it was justified by the photographer's  name in the corner: \"Carlo Salviati, Palermo.\" Over the top was written  in ink, in a man's handwriting: \"My wife and Leslie, from Tristram.\"    \"Who is it?\" asked Everard, gazing at the portrait with curiosity.  \"She's rather decent looking. Never seen her here, though, that I can  remember!\"    \"It's a ducky little baby! But who is Tristram?\" said Dulcie.    \"We had an Uncle Tristram once,\" answered Lilias doubtfully.    \"Why, but he died years and years ago, when we were all kids!\" returned  Everard.    \"I know. He was the only Tristram in the family, though. I can't  imagine who these two can be. Leslie, too! Why, that's Grandfather's  name! Was the baby christened after him?\"    \"We'll ask Cousin Clare sometime,\" said Dulcie, so interested that she  could scarcely tear herself away. \"I really want to know most fearfully  who they are.\"    \"Oh, don't bother about photos at present! Let's find Grandfather!\"  urged Everard. \"Perhaps he's gone down to the stables, or he may be in  the gun-room.\"    On further inquiry, however, they ascertained that a telegram had  arrived for Mr. Ingleton, on the receipt of which he had consulted Miss  Clare, had ordered the smaller car, and they had both been driven away  by Milner, the chauffeur, and were not expected back until seven or  eight o'clock in the evening. This was news indeed. For a whole day the  heads of the establishment would be absent, and the younger generation  had the place to themselves. For the next eight hours they could do  practically as they pleased.    Everard stood for a moment thinking. He did not reveal quite all that  passed through his mind, but the first instalment was sufficient for the  family.    \"We'll get out the touring car, take some lunch with us, and have a  joy-ride.\"    Five delighted faces smiled their appreciation.    \"Oh, Everard! Dare we?\" Dulcie's objection was consciously faint.    \"Why not? When Grandfather's away, I consider I've a right to take his  place and use the car if I want. I'm master here in his absence! I'll  make it all right with him; don't you girls alarm yourselves! Tear off  and put on your coats, and tell Atkins to pack us a basket of lunch, and  to put some coffee in the thermos flasks.\"    With Everard willing to assume the full responsibility the girls could  not resist such a tempting offer, while the younger boys were, of  course, only too ready to follow where their elders led. Elton, the  groom, made some slight demur when Everard went down to the motor-house  and began to get out the big touring-car, but the boy behaved with such  assurance that he concluded he must be acting with his grandfather's  permission. Moreover, Elton was in charge of the horses, and not the  cars, and Milner, the chauffeur, who might reasonably have raised  objections, was away driving his master.    The cook, who perhaps considered it was no business of hers to offer  remonstrances, and that the house would be quieter without the young  folks, hastily packed a picnic hamper and filled the thermos flasks. A  rejoicing crew carried them outside and stowed them in the car.    It seemed a delightful adventure to go off in this way entirely on  their own. There was some slight wrangling over seats, but Everard  settled it in his lofty fashion.    \"You'll sit where I tell you. I'll have Lilias in front, and the rest of  you may pack in behind. If you don't like it, you can stop at home. No,  I'm not going to have you kids interfering here, so you needn't think  it.\"    Everard had been taught by the chauffeur to drive, and could manage a  car quite tolerably well. He possessed any amount of confidence, which  is a good or bad quality according to circumstances. He ran the large  touring \"Daimler\" successfully through the park, and turned her out at  the great iron gateway on to the highroad. Everybody was in the keenest  spirits. It was a lovely day, wonderfully mild for January, and the  sunshine was so pleasant that they hardly needed the thick fur rugs.  There seemed a hint of spring in the air; already hazel catkins hung  here and there in the hedgerows, thrushes and robins were singing  cheerily, and wayside cottages were covered with the blossom of the  yellow jessamine. It was a joy to spin along the good smooth highroad in  the luxurious car. Everard was a quick driver, and kept a pace which  sometimes exceeded the speed limit. Fortunately his brothers and sisters  were not nervous, or they might have held their breath as he dashed  round corners without sounding his horn, pelted down hills, and on  several occasions narrowly avoided colliding with farm carts. A reckless  boy of seventeen, without much previous experience, does not make the  most careful of motorists. As a matter of fact it was the first time  Master Everard had driven without the chauffeur at his elbow, and,  though he got on very well, his performance was not unattended with  risks.    Towards one o'clock the crew at the back began to clamor for lunch, and  to suggest a halt when some suitable spot should be reached. The  difficulty was to find a place, for they were driving so fast that by  the time the younger boys had called out the possibilities of some wood  or small quarry, the car had flown past, and, sooner than turn back,  Everard would say: \"Oh, we'll stop somewhere else!\"    By unanimous urging, however, he was at last persuaded to halt at a  picturesque little bridge in a sheltered hollow, where they had the  benefit of the sunshine and escaped the wind. A small brook wandered  below between green banks where autumn brambles still showed brown  leaves, and actually a shriveled blackberry or two remained. There was a  patch of grass by the roadside, and here Everard put the car, to be out  of reach of passing traffic, while its occupants spread the rugs on the  low wall of the bridge, and began to unpack their picnic baskets. Cook  had certainly done her best for them: there were ham sandwiches and  pieces of cold pie, and jam turnovers, and slices of cake, and some  apples and oranges, and plenty of hot coffee in the thermos flasks.    \"It's ever so much nicer to have one's meals out-of-doors, even in  January!\" declared Bevis, munching a damson tartlet, and dropping stones  into the brook below. \"I believe it's warm enough to wade. That water  doesn't look cold, somehow!\"    \"No, you don't!\" said Lilias briskly. \"You needn't think, just because  Miss Mason isn't here, you can do all the mad things you like. It's no  use beginning to unlace your boots, for I shan't let you wade, or  Clifford either! The idea! In January!\"    \"Why not?\" sulked Bevis. \"I didn't ask _you_, Lilias. Everard won't say  no!\"    \"You can please yourselves,\" answered his eldest brother, \"but _I'm_  going to take the car on now. If you stay and wade, you'll have to walk  home, that's all! I certainly shan't came back for you.\"    At so awful a threat the youngsters, who had really meant business where  the water was concerned, hurriedly relaced their boots, and ran to take  their places in the car; the girls finished packing the remains of the  picnic in the basket, and followed, and soon the engine was started  again, and they were once more flying along the road.    Everard had brought out the family for a joy-ride without any very  particular idea of where they were going, though he was steering  generally in the direction of the Cleland Hills. To his mind the chief  fun of the expedition lay in simply taking any road that looked  interesting, without regard to sign-posts. The others trusted implicitly  to his powers of path-finding, and had really not the slightest idea in  what part of the country they were traveling. After quite a long time,  however, it occurred to Lilias to ask where they were, and how long it  would take them to get home again.    \"We've come such a roundabout route, I scarcely know,\" replied Everard.  \"Those are the Cleland Hills in front of us, though, and if we bowl  straight ahead, and go over them, we shall get to Clacton Bridge; then  we can get the straight highroad back to Cheverley.\"    \"We shan't"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21677"],[0,"Milton (#3)"],[1," his epic, trusting to the same inspiration, he  challenges the supremacy of the ancients by his                      adventrous song    That with no middle flight intends to soar    Above the Aonian mount, while it pursues    Things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme.    \"This man cuts us all out, and the Ancients too,\" Dryden is reported to  have said. But this man intended to do no less, and formally announced  his intention. It is impossible to outface Milton, or to abash him with  praise. His most enthusiastic eulogists are compelled merely to echo the  remarks of his earliest and greatest critic, himself. Yet with all this,  none of the later critics, not the most cavalier nor the dullest, has  dared to call him vain. His estimate of himself, offered as simple fact,  has been accepted in the same spirit, and one abyss of ineptitude still  yawns for the heroic folly, or the clownish courage, of the New  Criticism.          CHAPTER I  JOHN MILTON      John Milton, the son of a middle-aged scrivener, was born on Friday,  December the 9th, 1608, at his father's house in Bread Street, Cheapside;  and died on Sunday, November the 8th, 1674, in a small house, with but  one room on a floor, in Artillery Walk, Bunhill Fields, London. Of his  father the records that remain show him to have been a convinced member  of the Puritan party in the Church, a man of liberal culture and  intelligence, a lover of music (which taste Milton inherited), a wise and  generous friend to the son who became a poet. We owe it to his wisdom  rather than to his prosperity that Milton was allowed to live at home  without any ostensible profession until he was thirty years of age and  more.    For the first sixteen years of his life Milton was educated partly at  home, by a Presbyterian tutor called Thomas Young, partly at St. Paul's  School, which he attended for some years as a day-scholar. From his  twelfth year onward he was an omnivorous reader, and before he left  school had written some boyish verses, void of merit. The next fourteen  years of his life, after leaving school, were spent at Cambridge, in  Buckinghamshire, and in foreign travel, so that he was thirty years old  before he lived continuously in London again.    We know pretty well how he spent his time at Cambridge and at Horton,  sedulously turning over the Greek and Latin classics, dreaming of  immortality. We know less about his early years in London, where there  were wider and better opportunities of gaining an insight into \"all  seemly and generous arts and affairs.\" London was a great centre of  traffic, a motley crowd of adventurers and traders even in those days,  and the boy Milton must often have wandered down to the river below  London Bridge to see the ships come in. His poems are singularly full of  figures drawn from ships and shipping, some of them bookish in their  origin, others which may have been suggested by the sight of ships. Now  it is Satan, who, after his fateful journey through chaos, nears the  world,      And like a weather-beaten vessel holds    Gladly the port, though shrouds and tackle torn.    Now it is Dalila, whom the Chorus behold approaching.      Like a stately ship    Of Tarsus, bound for the isles    Of Javan or Gadire,    With all her bravery on, and tackle trim,    Sails filled, and streamers waving,    Courted by all the winds that hold them play.    Or, again, it is Samson reproaching himself,      Who, like a foolish pilot, have shipwracked    My vessel trusted to me from above,    Gloriously rigged.    The bulk of Satan is compared to the great sea-beast Leviathan, beheld  off the coast of Norway by      The pilot of some small night-founder'd skiff.    In his approach to the happy garden the Adversary is likened to                          them who sail    Beyond the Cape of Hope, and now are past    Mozambic, off at sea north-east winds blow    Sabaean odours from the spicy shore    Of Araby the Blest, with such delay    Well pleased they slack their course, and many a league    Cheered with the grateful smell old Ocean smiles;    So entertained those odorous sweets the Fiend.    And when he draws near to Eve in the rose-thicket,                      sidelong he works his way,    As when a ship, by skilful steersman wrought,    Nigh river's mouth, or foreland, where the wind    Veers oft, as oft so steers, and shifts her sail.    There is nothing here that is not within the reach of any inland reader,  but Milton's choice of nautical similitudes may serve to remind us how  much of the interest of Old London centred round its port. Here were to  be heard those tales of far-sought adventure and peril which gave even to  the boisterous life of Elizabethan London an air of triviality and  security. Hereby came in \"the variety of fashions and foreign stuffs,\"  which Fynes Moryson, writing in Milton's childhood, compares to the stars  of heaven and the sands of the sea for number. All sorts of characters,  nationalities, and costumes were daily to be seen in Paul's Walk,  adjoining Milton's school. One sort interests us pre-eminently. \"In the  general pride of England,\" says Fynes Moryson, \"there is no fit  difference made of degrees; for very Bankrupts, Players, and Cutpurses go  apparelled like gentlemen.\" Shakespeare was alive during the first seven  years of Milton's life, and was no doubt sometimes a visitor to the  Mermaid, a stone's throw from the scrivener's house. Perhaps his cloak  brushed the child Milton in the street. Milton was born in the golden age  of the drama, and a score of masterpieces were put upon the London stage  while he was in his cradle. But the golden age passed rapidly; the  quality of the drama degenerated and the opposition to it grew strong  before he was of years to attend a play. Perhaps he never saw a play by  the masters during his boyhood, and his visits              to the well-trod stage anon,    If Jonson's learned sock be on,    Or sweetest Shakespeare, Fancy's child,    Warble his native woodnotes wild,    were either excursions of the imagination or belong to his later  occasional sojourns in London. In his _Eikonoklastes_ he quotes certain  lines from _Richard III._, and here and there in his prose, as well as in  his verse, there are possibly some faint reminiscences of Shakespearian  phrases. So, for instance, in _The Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce_,  he seems to echo a famous speech of Macbeth, while he claims that his  remedy of free divorce \"hath the virtue to soften and dispel rooted and  knotty sorrows, and without enchantment.\" But these are doubtless the  memories of reading. In the _Apology for Smectymnuus_, when he has to  reply to the charge that he \"haunted playhouses\" during his college days,  he retorts the charge, it is true, rather than denies it. Yet the retort  bespeaks a certain severity and preciseness in judging of plays and their  actors, which can hardly have found gratification in the licenses and  exuberances of the contemporary drama. It was not difficult, he remarks,  to see plays, \"when in the Colleges so many of the young divines, and  those in next aptitude to divinity, have been seen so often upon the  stage, writhing and unboning their clergy limbs to all the antic and  dishonest gestures of Trinculoes, buffoons, and bawds.\" \"If it be  unlawful,\" he continues, \"to sit and behold a mercenary comedian  personating that which is least unseemly for a hireling to do, how much  more blameful is it to endure the sight of as vile things acted by  persons either entered, or presently to enter into the ministry; and how  much more foul and ignominious for them to be the actors!\"    It was, at least, a happy chance that the first of Milton's verses to  appear in print should have been _An Epitaph on the Admirable Dramatick  Poet, W. Shakespeare_, contributed to the Second Folio in 1632. The main  interests of the household at the Spread Eagle in Bread Street must have  been far enough remote from the doings of the companies of players. John  Milton the elder would probably have agreed with Sir Thomas Bodley, who  called plays \"riffe-raffes,\" and declared that they should never come  into his library. The Hampton Court Conference, the Synod of Dort, the  ever-widening divisions in the Church, between Arminian and Calvinist,  between Prelatist and Puritan, were probably subjects of a nearer  interest, even to the poet in his youth, than the production of new or  old plays upon the stage. Milton's childhood was spent in the very  twilight of the Elizabethan age; it was greatly fortunate for him, and  for us, that he caught the after-glow of the sunset upon his face. He  read Spenser while Spenser was still the dominant influence in English  poetry. \"He hath confessed to me,\" said Dryden, \"that Spenser was his  original,\"--an incredible statement unless we understand \"original\" in  the sense of his earliest admiration, his poetic godfather who first won  him to poetry. He read Shakespeare and Jonson in the first editions. He  read Sylvester's translation of _Du Bartas, His Divine Weekes and  Workes_; and perhaps thence conceived the first vague idea of a poem on a  kindred subject. It is necessary to insist on his English masters,  because, although the greater part of his time and study was devoted to  the classics, the instrument that he was to use was learned in a native  school. His metre, his magnificent vocabulary, his unerring phraseology,  took learning and practice. He attached a high value to his study of  English poetry. When he spoke of \"our sage and serious Spenser (whom I  dare be known to think a better teacher than Scotus or Aquinas),\" he was  conscious that he was maintaining what seemed a bold paradox in an age  when scholasticism still controlled education. It is pleasant to think of  Milton during these early years, whether in London or at Christ's  College, in his \"calm and pleasing solitariness, fed with cheerful and  confident thoughts,\" "]]]
