But although I was afraid that attendance on a few public lectures,  such as I could give, would hardly benefit a candidate who was not  already fully prepared to pass through the fiery ordeal of the three  London examinations, I could not on the other hand shut my eyes  completely to the fact that, after all, universities were not meant  entirely, or even chiefly, as stepping-stones to an examination, but  that there is something else which universities can teach and ought to  teach--nay, which I feel quite sure they were originally meant to  teach--something that may not have a marketable value before a Board  of Examiners, but which has a permanent value for the whole of our  life, and that is a real interest in our work, and, more than that, a  love of our work, and, more than that, a true joy and happiness in our  work. If a university can teach that, if it can engraft that one small  living germ in the minds of the young men who come here to study and  to prepare themselves for the battle of life, and, for what is still  more difficult to encounter, the daily dull drudgery of life, then, I  feel convinced, a university has done more, and conferred a more  lasting benefit on its pupils than by helping them to pass the most  difficult examinations, and to take the highest place among Senior  Wranglers or First-Class men.    Unfortunately, that kind of work which is now required for passing one  examination after another, that process of cramming and crowding which  has of late been brought to the highest pitch of perfection, has often  the very opposite effect, and instead of exciting an appetite for  work, it is apt to produce an indifference, if not a kind of  intellectual nausea, that may last for life.    And nowhere is this so much to be feared as in the case of candidates  for the Indian Civil Service. After they have passed their first  examination for admission to the Indian Civil Service, and given proof  that they have received the benefits of a liberal education, and  acquired that general information in classics, history, and  mathematics, which is provided at our public schools, and forms no  doubt the best and surest foundation for all more special and  professional studies in later life, they suddenly find themselves torn  away from their old studies and their old friends, and compelled to  take up new subjects which to many of them seem strange, outlandish,  if not repulsive. Strange alphabets, strange languages, strange names,  strange literatures and laws have to be faced, \"to be got up\" as it is  called, not from choice, but from dire necessity. The whole course of  study during two years is determined for them, the subjects fixed, the  books prescribed, the examinations regulated, and there is no time to  look either right or left, if a candidate wishes to make sure of  taking each successive fence in good style, and without an accident.    I know quite well that this cannot be helped. I am not speaking  against the system of examinations in general, if only they are  intelligently conducted; nay, as an old examiner myself, I feel bound  to say that the amount of knowledge produced ready-made at these  examinations is to my mind perfectly astounding. But while the answers  are there on paper, strings of dates, lists of royal names and  battles, irregular verbs, statistical figures and whatever else you  like, how seldom do we find that the heart of the candidates is in the  work which they have to do. The results produced are certainly most  ample and voluminous, but they rarely contain a spark of original  thought, or even a clever mistake. It is work done from necessity, or,  let us be just, from a sense of duty, but it is seldom, or hardly  ever, a labor of love.    Now why should that be? Why should a study of Greek or Latin--of the  poetry, the philosophy, the laws and the art of Greece and Italy--seem  congenial to us, why should it excite even a certain enthusiasm, and  command general respect, while a study of Sanskrit, and of the ancient  poetry, the philosophy, the laws, and the art of India is looked upon,  in the best case, as curious, but is considered by most people as  useless, tedious, if not absurd?    And, strange to say, this feeling exists in England more than in any  other country. In France, Germany, and Italy, even in Denmark, Sweden,  and Russia, there is a vague charm connected with the name of India.  One of the most beautiful poems in the German language is the  _Weisheit der Brahmanen_, the \"Wisdom of the Brahmans,\" by Rueckert, to  my mind more rich in thought and more perfect in form than even  Goethe's _West-oestlicher Divan_. A scholar who studies Sanskrit in  Germany is supposed to be initiated in the deep and dark mysteries of  ancient wisdom, and a man who has travelled in India, even if he has  only discovered Calcutta, or Bombay, or Madras, is listened to like  another Marco Polo. In England a student of Sanskrit is generally  considered a bore, and an old Indian civil servant, if he begins to  describe the marvels of Elephanta or the Towers of Silence, runs the  risk of producing a count-out.    There are indeed a few Oriental scholars whose works are read, and who  have acquired a certain celebrity in England, because they were really  men of uncommon genius, and would have ranked among the great glories  of the country, but for the misfortune that their energies were  devoted to Indian literature--I mean Sir William Jones, \"one of the  most enlightened of the sons of men,\" as Dr. Johnson called him, and  Thomas Colebrooke. But the names of others who have done good work in  their day also, men such as Ballantyne, Buchanan, Carey, Crawfurd,  Davis, Elliot, Ellis, Houghton, Leyden, Mackenzie, Marsden, Muir,  Prinsep, Rennell, Turnour, Upham, Wallich, Warren, Wilkins, Wilson,  and many others, are hardly known beyond the small circle of Oriental  scholars; and their works are looked for in vain in libraries which  profess to represent with a certain completeness the principal  branches of scholarship and science in England.    How many times, when I advised young men, candidates for the Indian  Civil Service, to devote themselves before all things to a study of  Sanskrit, have I been told, \"What is the use of our studying Sanskrit?  There are translations of _S_akuntala, Manu, and the Hitopade_s_a, and  what else is there in that literature that is worth reading? Kalidasa  may be very pretty, and the Laws of Manu are very curious, and the  fables of the Hitopade_s_a are very quaint; but you would not compare  Sanskrit literature with Greek, or recommend us to waste our time in  copying and editing Sanskrit texts which either teach us nothing that  we do not know already, or teach us something which we do not care to  know?\"    This seems to me a most unhappy misconception, and it will be the  chief object of my lectures to try to remove it, or at all events to  modify it, as much as possible. I shall not attempt to prove that  Sanskrit literature is as good as Greek literature. Why should we  always compare? A study of Greek literature has its own purpose, and a  study of Sanskrit literature has its own purpose; but what I feel  convinced of, and hope to convince you of, is that Sanskrit  literature, if studied only in a right spirit, is full of human  interests, full of lessons which even Greek could never teach us, a  subject worthy to occupy the leisure, and more than the leisure, of  every Indian civil servant; and certainly the best means of making any  young man who has to spend five-and-twenty years of his life in India,  feel at home among the Indians, as a fellow-worker among  fellow-workers, and not as an alien among aliens. There will be  abundance of useful and most interesting work for him to do, if only  he cares to do it, work such as he would look for in vain, whether in  Italy or in Greece, or even among the pyramids of Egypt or the palaces  of Babylon.    You will now understand why I have chosen as the title of my lectures,  \"What can India teach us?\" True, there are many things which India has  to learn from us; but there are other things, and, in one sense, very  important things, which we too may learn from India.    If I were to look over the whole world to find out the country most  richly endowed with all the wealth, power, and beauty that nature can  bestow--in some parts a very paradise on earth--I should point to  India. If I were asked under what sky the human mind has most full  developed some of its choicest gifts, has most deeply pondered on the  greatest problems of life, and has found solutions of some of them  which well deserve the attention even of those who have studied Plato  and Kant--I should point to India. And if I were to ask myself from  what literature we, here in Europe, we who have been nurtured almost  exclusively on the thoughts of Greeks and Romans, and of one Semitic  race, the Jewish, may draw that corrective which is most wanted in  order to make our inner life more perfect, more comprehensive, more  universal, in fact more truly human, a life, not for this life only,  but a transfigured and eternal life--again I should point to India.    I know you will be surprised to hear me say this. I know that more  particularly those who have spent many years of active life in  Calcutta, or Bombay, or Madras, will be horror-struck at the idea that  the humanity they meet with there, whether in the bazaars or in the  courts of justice, or in so-called native society, should be able to  teach _us_ any lessons.    Let me therefore explain at once to my friends who may have lived in  India for years, as civil servants, or officers, or missionaries, or  merchants, and who ought to know a great deal more of that country  than one who has never set foot on the soil of Aryavarta, that we are  speaking of two very different Indias. I am thinking chiefly of India  such as it was a thousand, two"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20848"],[0,"An Elementary Study of Chemistry (#3)"],[1,"small evaporating dish and gently heated (Fig. 2) until the water has  disappeared, or _evaporated_. The solid left in the dish is identical in  every way with the original salt. Both the iron and the salt have thus  been recovered in their original condition. It is evident that no new  substance has been formed by rubbing the salt and iron together. The  product is called a _mechanical mixture_. Such mixtures are very common  in nature, almost all minerals, sands, and soils being examples of this  class of substances. It is at once apparent that there is no law  regulating the composition of a mechanical mixture, and no two mixtures  are likely to have exactly the same composition. The ingredients of a  mechanical mixture can usually be separated by mechanical means, such as  sifting, sorting, magnetic attraction, or by dissolving one constituent  and leaving the other unchanged.    [Illustration: Fig. 2]    DEFINITION: _A mechanical mixture is one in which the constituents  retain their original properties, no chemical action having taken place  when they were brought together._    ~Chemical compounds.~ If iron filings and powdered sulphur are thoroughly  ground together in a mortar, a yellowish-green substance results. It  might easily be taken to be a new body; but as in the case of the iron  and salt, the ingredients can readily be separated. A magnet draws out  the iron. Water does not dissolve the sulphur, but other liquids do, as,  for example, the liquid called carbon disulphide. When the mixture is  treated with carbon disulphide the iron is left unchanged, and the  sulphur can be obtained again, after filtering off the iron, by  evaporating the liquid. The substance is, therefore, a mechanical  mixture.    If now a new portion of the mixture is placed in a dry test tube and  carefully heated in the flame of a Bunsen burner, as shown in Fig. 3, a  striking change takes place. The mixture begins to glow at some point,  the glow rapidly extending throughout the whole mass. If the test tube  is now broken and the product examined, it will be found to be a hard,  black, brittle substance, in no way recalling the iron or the sulphur.  The magnet no longer attracts it; carbon disulphide will not dissolve  sulphur from it. It is a new substance with new properties, resulting  from the chemical union of iron and sulphur, and is called iron  sulphide. Such substances are called _chemical compounds_, and differ  from mechanical mixtures in that the substances producing them lose  their own characteristic properties. We shall see later that the two  also differ in that the composition of a chemical compound never varies.    [Illustration: Fig. 3]    DEFINITION: _A chemical compound is a substance the constituents of  which have lost their own characteristic properties, and which cannot be  separated save by a chemical change._    ~Elements.~ It has been seen that iron sulphide is composed of two  entirely different substances,--iron and sulphur. The question arises,  Do these substances in turn contain other substances, that is, are they  also chemical compounds? Chemists have tried in a great many ways to  decompose them, but all their efforts have failed. Substances which have  resisted all efforts to decompose them into other substances are called  _elements_. It is not always easy to prove that a given substance is  really an element. Some way as yet untried may be successful in  decomposing it into other simpler forms of matter, and the supposed  element will then prove to be a compound. Water, lime, and many other  familiar compounds were at one time thought to be elements.    DEFINITION: _An element is a substance which cannot be separated into  simpler substances by any known means._    ~Kinds of matter.~ While matter has been grouped in three classes for the  purpose of study, it will be apparent that there are really but two  distinct kinds of matter, namely, compounds and elements. A mechanical  mixture is not a third distinct kind of matter, but is made up of  varying quantities of either compounds or elements or both.    ~Alchemy.~ In olden times it was thought that some way could be found to  change one element into another, and a great many efforts were made to  accomplish this transformation. Most of these efforts were directed  toward changing the commoner metals into gold, and many fanciful ways  for doing this were described. The chemists of that time were called  _alchemists_, and the art which they practiced was called _alchemy_. The  alchemists gradually became convinced that the only way common metals  could be changed into gold was by the wonderful power of a magic  substance which they called the _philosopher's stone_, which would  accomplish this transformation by its mere touch and would in addition  give perpetual youth to its fortunate possessor. No one has ever found  such a stone, and no one has succeeded in changing one metal into  another.    ~Number of elements.~ The number of substances now considered to be  elements is not large--about eighty in all. Many of these are rare, and  very few of them make any large fraction of the materials in the  earth's crust. Clarke gives the following estimate of the composition of  the earth's crust:        Oxygen       47.0%       Calcium           3.5%      Silicon      27.9        Magnesium         2.5      Aluminium     8.1        Sodium            2.7      Iron          4.7        Potassium         2.4                  Other elements       1.2%    A complete list of the elements is given in the Appendix. In this list  the more common of the elements are marked with an asterisk. It is not  necessary to study more than a third of the total number of elements to  gain a very good knowledge of chemistry.    ~Physical state of the elements.~ About ten of the elements are gases at  ordinary temperatures. Two--mercury and bromine--are liquids. The others  are all solids, though their melting points vary through wide limits,  from caesium which melts at 26 deg. to elements which do not melt save in the  intense heat of the electric furnace.    ~Occurrence of the elements.~ Comparatively few of the elements occur as  uncombined substances in nature, most of them being found in the form of  chemical compounds. When an element does occur by itself, as is the case  with gold, we say that it occurs in the _free state_ or _native_; when  it is combined with other substances in the form of compounds, we say  that it occurs in the _combined state_, or _in combination_. In the  latter case there is usually little about the compound to suggest that  the element is present in it; for we have seen that elements lose their  own peculiar properties when they enter into combination with other  elements. It would never be suspected, for example, that the reddish,  earthy-looking iron ore contains iron.    ~Names of elements.~ The names given to the elements have been selected in  a great many different ways. (1) Some names are very old and their  original meaning is obscure. Such names are iron, gold, and copper. (2)  Many names indicate some striking physical property of the element. The  name bromine, for example, is derived from a Greek word meaning a  stench, referring to the extremely unpleasant odor of the substance. The  name iodine comes from a word meaning violet, alluding to the beautiful  color of iodine vapor. (3) Some names indicate prominent chemical  properties of the elements. Thus, nitrogen means the producer of niter,  nitrogen being a constituent of niter or saltpeter. Hydrogen means water  former, signifying its presence in water. Argon means lazy or inert, the  element being so named because of its inactivity. (4) Other elements are  named from countries or localities, as germanium and scandium.    ~Symbols.~ In indicating the elements found in compounds it is  inconvenient to use such long names, and hence chemists have adopted a  system of abbreviations. These abbreviations are known as _symbols_,  each element having a distinctive symbol. (1) Sometimes the initial  letter of the name will suffice to indicate the element. Thus I stands  for iodine, C for carbon. (2) Usually it is necessary to add some other  characteristic letter to the symbol, since several names may begin with  the same letter. Thus C stands for carbon, Cl for chlorine, Cd for  cadmium, Ce for cerium, Cb for columbium. (3) Sometimes the symbol is an  abbreviation of the old Latin name. In this way Fe (ferrum) indicates  iron, Cu (cuprum), copper, Au (aurum), gold. The symbols are included in  the list of elements given in the Appendix. They will become familiar  through constant use.    ~Chemical affinity the cause of chemical combination.~ The agency which  causes substances to combine and which holds them together when combined  is called _chemical affinity_. The experiments described in this  chapter, however, show that heat is often necessary to bring about  chemical action. The distinction between the cause producing chemical  action and the circumstances favoring it must be clearly made. Chemical  affinity is always the cause of chemical union. Many agencies may make  it possible for chemical affinity to act by overcoming circumstances  which stand in its way. Among these agencies are heat, light, and  electricity. As a rule, solution also promotes action between two  substances. Sometimes these agencies may overcome chemical attraction  and so occasion the decomposition of a compound.      EXERCISES    1.
