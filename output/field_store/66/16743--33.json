Plateau (_Pogg. Ann._, 141, 44) and Quincke (_Wiedmann's. Ann._, 35,  592) have made very complete researches on the emulsification and  foaming of liquids and on the formation of bubbles. The former considers  that there are two properties of a liquid which play an important part  in the phenomenon, (1) it must have considerable viscosity, and (2) its  surface tension must be low. Quincke holds similar views, but considers  that no pure liquid will foam.    Soap solution admirably fulfils Plateau's second condition, its surface  tension being only about 40 per cent. of that of water, while its  cohesion is also very small; and it is doubtless to this property that  its emulsifying power is chiefly due. So far as viscosity is concerned,  this can have but little influence, for a 1 per cent. solution of sodium  oleate, which has a viscosity very little different from that of pure  water, is an excellent emulsifying agent.    Hillyer, to whose work reference has already been made, investigated the  whole question of detergent action very exhaustively, and, as the result  of a very large number of experiments, concludes that the cleansing  power of soap is largely or entirely to be explained by the power which  it has of emulsifying oily substances, of wetting and penetrating into  oily textures, and of lubricating texture and impurities so that these  may be removed easily. It is thought that all these properties may be  explained by taking into account the low cohesion of the soap solutions,  and their strong attraction or affinity to oily matter, which together  cause the low surface tension between soap solution and oil.          CHAPTER II.    CONSTITUTION OF OILS AND FATS, AND THEIR SAPONIFICATION.         _Researches of Chevreul and Berthelot--Mixed Glycerides--Modern       Theories of Saponification--Hydrolysis accelerated by (1) Heat       or Electricity, (2) Ferments; Castor-seed Ferment, Steapsin,       Emulsin, and (3) Chemical Reagents; Sulphuric Acid, Twitchell's       Reagent, Hydrochloric Acid, Lime, Magnesia, Zinc Oxide, Soda       and Potash._      The term oil is of very wide significance, being applied to substances  of vastly different natures, both organic and inorganic, but so far as  soap-making materials are concerned, it may be restricted almost  entirely to the products derived from animal and vegetable sources,  though many attempts have been made during the last few years to also  utilise mineral oils for the preparation of soap. Fats readily become  oils on heating beyond their melting points, and may be regarded as  frozen oils.    Although Scheele in 1779 discovered that in the preparation of lead  plaster glycerol is liberated, soap at that time was regarded as a mere  mechanical mixture, and the constitution of oils and fats was not  properly understood. It was Chevreul who showed that the manufacture of  soap involved a definite chemical decomposition of the oil or fat into  fatty acid and glycerol, the fatty acid combining with soda, potash, or  other base, to form the soap, and the glycerol remaining free. The  reactions with stearin and palmitin (of which tallow chiefly consists)  and with olein (found largely in olive and cotton-seed oils) are as  follows:--              CH_{2}OOC_{18}H_{35}                             CH_{2}OH            |                                                |            CHOOC_{18}H_{35} + 3NaOH = 3NaOOC_{18}H_{35} +   CHOH            |                                                |            CH_{2}OOC_{18}H_{35}                             CH_{2}OH                stearin         sodium       sodium            glycerol                             hydroxide     stearate                CH_{2}OOC_{16}H_{31}                             CH_{2}OH            |                                                |            CHOOC_{16}H_{31} + 3NaOH = 3NaOOC_{16}H_{31} +   CHOH            |                                                |            CH_{2}OOC_{16}H_{31}                             CH_{2}OH                 palmitin        sodium      sodium            glycerol                              hydroxide    palmitate              CH_{2}OOC_{18}H_{33}                           CH_{2}OH            |                                              |            CHOOC_{18}H_{33} + 3NaOH = 3NaOOC_{18}H_{33} + CHOH            |                                              |            CH_{2}OOC_{18}H_{33}                           CH_{2}OH              olein              sodium    sodium            glycerol                              hydroxide  oleate    Berthelot subsequently confirmed Chevreul's investigations by directly  synthesising the fats from fatty acids and glycerol, the method he  adopted consisting in heating the fatty acids with glycerol in sealed  tubes. Thus, for example:--      3C_{18}H_{35}O_{2}H + C_{3}H_{5}(OH)_{3} = C_{3}H_{5}(C_{18}H_{35}O_{2})_{3}    stearic acid           glycerol              tristearin    Since glycerol is a trihydric alcohol, _i.e._, contains three hydroxyl  (OH) groups, the hydrogen atoms of which are displaceable by acid  radicles, the above reaction may be supposed to take place in three  stages. Thus, we may have:--        (1) C_{18}H_{35}O_{2}H + C_{3}H_{5}(OH)_{3} =             C_{3}H_{5}(OH)_{2}C_{18}H_{35}O_{2} + H_{2}O                                              monostearin        (2) C_{18}H_{35}O_{2}H + C_{3}H_{5}(OH)_{2}C_{18}H_{35}O_{2} =             C_{3}H_{5}(OH)(C_{18}H_{35}O_{2})_{2} + H_{2}O                                              distearin        (3) C_{18}H_{35}O_{2}H + C_{3}H_{5}(OH)(C_{18}H_{35}O_{2})_{2} =             C_{3}H_{5}(C_{18}H_{35}O_{2})_{3} + H_{2}O                                              tristearin    There are two possible forms of monoglyceride and diglyceride, according  to the relative position of the acid radicle, these being termed alpha  and beta respectively, and represented by the following formulae, where R  denotes the acid radicle:--    _Monoglyceride_:--                       CH_{2}OR                     CH_{2}OH                     |                            |            (alpha)  CHOH           and (beta)    CHOR                     |                            |                     CH_{2}OH                     CH_{2}OH    _Diglyceride_:--                       CH_{2}OR                     CH_{2}OR                     |                            |            (alpha)  CHOH           and (beta)    CHOR                     |                            |                     CH_{2}OR                     CH_{2}OH    According to the relative proportions of fatty acid and glycerol used,  and the temperature to which they were heated, Berthelot succeeded in  preparing mono-, di- and triglycerides of various fatty acids.    Practically all the oils and fats used in soap-making consist of  mixtures of these compounds of glycerol with fatty acids, which  invariably occur in nature in the form of triglycerides.    It was formerly considered that the three acid radicles in any naturally  occurring glyceride were identical, corresponding to the formula--              CH_{2}OR            |            CHOR            |            CH_{2}OR    where R denotes the acid radicle. Recent work, however, has shown the  existence of several so-called _mixed glycerides_, in which the  hydroxyls of the same molecule of glycerol are displaced by two or  sometimes three different acid radicles.    The first mixed glyceride to be discovered was oleodistearin,  C_{3}H_{5}(OC_{18}H_{35}O)(OC_{18}H_{35}O)_{2}, obtained by Heise in 1896  Mkani fat. Hansen has since found that tallow contains oleodipalmitin,  from C_{3}H_{5}(OC_{18}H_{35}O)(OC_{16}H_{31}O), stearodipalmitin,  C_{3}H_{5}(OC_{18}H_{35}O)(OC_{16}H_{31}O), oleopalmitostearin,  C_{3}H_{5}(OC_{18}H_{33}O)(OC_{16}H_{31}O)(OC_{18}H_{35}O) and  palmitodistearin, CH(OC_{16}H_{31}O)(OC_{18}H_{35}O)_{2}, the latter of  which has also been obtained by Kreis and Hafner from lard, while Holde  and Stange have shown that olive oil contains from 1 to 2 per cent. of  oleodidaturin, C_{3}H_{5}(OC_{18}H_{33}O)(OC_{17}H_{33}O)_{2}, and  Hehner and Mitchell have obtained indications of mixed glycerides in  linseed oil (which they consider contains a compound of glycerol with  two radicles of linolenic acid and one radicle of oleic acid), also in  cod-liver, cod, whale and shark oils.    In some cases the fatty acids are combined with other bases than  glycerol. As examples may be cited beeswax, containing myricin or  myricyl palmitate, and spermaceti, consisting chiefly of cetin or cetyl  palmitate, and herein lies the essential difference between fats and  waxes, but as these substances are not soap-making materials, though  sometimes admixed with soap to accomplish some special object, they do  not require further consideration.

But,  unlike them, he was clumsy, awkward, loose-jointed, and a bad shot.  Nevertheless Henri was an immense favourite in the settlement, for his  good-humour knew no bounds.  No one ever saw him frown.  Even when  fighting with the savages, as he was sometimes compelled to do in  self-defence, he went at them with a sort of jovial rage that was almost  laughable.  Inconsiderate recklessness was one of his chief  characteristics, so that his comrades were rather afraid of him on the  war-trail or in the hunt, where caution, and frequently _soundless_  motion, were essential to success or safety.  But when Henri had a  comrade at his side to check him he was safe enough, being humble-minded  and obedient.  Men used to say he must have been born under a lucky  star, for, notwithstanding his natural inaptitude for all sorts of  backwoods life, he managed to scramble through everything with safety,  often with success, and sometimes with credit.    To see Henri stalk a deer was worth a long day's journey.  Joe Blunt  used to say he was \"all jints together, from the top of his head to the  sole of his moccasin.\"  He threw his immense form into the most  inconceivable contortions, and slowly wound his way, sometimes on hands  and knees, sometimes flat, through bush and brake, as if there was not a  bone in his body, and without the slightest noise.  This sort of work  was so much against his plunging nature, that he took long to learn it,  but when, through hard practice and the loss of many a fine deer, he  came at length to break himself in to it, he gradually progressed to  perfection, and ultimately became the best stalker in the valley.  This,  and this alone, enabled him to procure game, for, being short-sighted,  he could hit nothing beyond fifty yards, except a buffalo or a barn  door.    Yet that same lithe body, which seemed as though totally unhinged, could  no more be bent, when the muscles were strung, than an iron post.  No  one wrestled with Henri unless he wished to have his back broken.  Few  could equal and none could beat him at running or leaping except Dick  Varley.  When Henri ran a race even Joe Blunt laughed outright, for arms  and legs went like independent flails.  When he leaped, he hurled  himself into space with a degree of violence that seemed to insure a  somersault--yet he always came down with a crash on his feet.  Plunging  was Henri's forte.  He generally lounged about the settlement, when  unoccupied, with his hands behind his back, apparently in a reverie, and  when called on to act, he seemed to fancy he must have lost time, and  could only make up for it by _plunging_.  This habit got him into many  awkward scrapes, but his herculean power as often got him out of them.  He was a French-Canadian, and a particularly bad speaker of the English  language.    We offer no apology for this elaborate introduction of Henri, for he was  as good-hearted a fellow as ever lived, and deserves special notice.    But to return.  The sort of rifle practice called \"driving the nail,\" by  which this match was to be decided, was, and we believe still is, common  among the hunters of the far west.  It consisted in this,--an ordinary  large-headed nail was driven a short way into a plank or a tree, and the  hunters, standing at a distance of fifty yards or so, fired at it until  they succeeded in driving it home.  On the present occasion the major  resolved to test their shooting by making the distance seventy yards.    Some of the older men shook their heads.    \"It's too far,\" said one; \"ye might as well try to snuff the nose o' a  mosquito.\"    \"Jim Scraggs is the only man as'll hit that,\" said another.    The man referred to was a long, lank, lantern-jawed fellow with a  cross-grained expression of countenance.  He used the long, heavy,  Kentucky rifle, which, from the ball being little larger than a pea, was  called a pea-rifle.  Jim was no favourite, and had been named Scraggs by  his companions on account of his appearance.    In a few minutes the lots were drawn, and the shooting began.  Each  hunter wiped out the barrel of his piece with his ramrod as he stepped  forward; then, placing a ball in the palm of his left hand, he drew the  stopper of his powder-horn with his teeth, and poured out as much powder  as sufficed to cover the bullet.  This was the regular _measure_ among  them.  Little time was lost in firing, for these men did not \"hang\" on  their aim.  The point of the rifle was slowly raised to the object, and,  the instant the sight covered it, the ball sped to its mark.  In a few  minutes the nail was encircled by bullet-holes, scarcely two of which  were more than an inch distant from the mark, and one--fired by Joe  Blunt--entered the tree close beside it.    \"Ah, Joe!\" said the major, \"I thought you would have carried off the  prize.\"    \"So did not I, sir,\" returned Blunt, with a shake of his head.  \"Had it  a-bin a half-dollar at a hundred yards, I'd ha' done better, but I never  _could_ hit the nail.  It's too small to _see_.\"    \"That's cos ye've got no eyes,\" remarked Jim Scraggs, with a sneer, as  he stepped forward.    All tongues were now hushed, for the expected champion was about to  fire.  The sharp crack of the rifle was followed by a shout, for Jim had  hit the nail-head on the edge, and part of the bullet stuck to it.    \"That wins if there's no better,\" said the major, scarce able to conceal  his disappointment.  \"Who comes next?\"    To this question Henri answered by stepping up to the line, straddling  his legs, and executing preliminary movements with his rifle, that  seemed to indicate an intention on his part to throw the weapon bodily  at the mark.  He was received with a shout of mingled laughter and  applause.  After gazing steadily at the mark for a few seconds, a broad  grin overspread his countenance, and, looking round at his companions,  he said--\"Ha! mes boys, I cannot behold de nail at all!\"    \"Can ye `behold' the _tree_?\" shouted a voice, when the laugh that  followed this announcement had somewhat abated.    \"Oh! oui,\" replied Henri quite coolly; \"I can see _him_, an' a goot  small bit of de forest beyond.\"    \"Fire at it, then.  If ye hit the tree ye desarve the rifle--leastwise  ye ought to get the pup.\"    Henri grinned again, and fired instantly, without taking aim.    The shot was followed by an exclamation of surprise, for the bullet was  found close beside the nail!    \"It's more be good luck than good shootin',\" remarked Jim Scraggs.    \"Possiblement,\" answered Henri modestly, as he retreated to the rear and  wiped out his rifle; \"mais I have kill most of my deer by dat same goot  luck.\"    \"Bravo!  Henri,\" said Major Hope as he passed; \"you _deserve_ to win,  anyhow.  Who's next?\"    \"Dick Varley,\" cried several voices; \"where's Varley?  Come on,  youngster, an' take yer shot.\"    The youth came forward with evident reluctance.  \"It's of no manner o'  use,\" he whispered to Joe Blunt as he passed, \"I can't depend on my old  gun.\"    \"Never give in,\" whispered Blunt encouragingly.  Poor Varley's want of  confidence in his rifle was merited, for, on pulling the trigger, the  faithless lock missed fire.    \"Lend him another gun,\" cried several voices.  \"'Gainst rules laid down  by Major Hope,\" said Scraggs.    \"Well, so it is; try again.\"    Varley did try again, and so successfully, too, that the ball hit the  nail on the head, leaving a portion of the lead sticking to its edge.    Of course this was greeted with a cheer, and a loud dispute began as to  which was the better shot of the two.    \"There are others to shoot yet,\" cried the major.  \"Make way.  Look  out.\"    The men fell back, and the few hunters who had not yet fired took their  shots, but without coming nearer the mark.    It was now agreed that Jim Scraggs and Dick Varley, being the two best  shots, should try over again; and it was also agreed that Dick should  have the use of Blunt's rifle.  Lots were again drawn for the first  shot, and it fell to Dick, who immediately stepped out, aimed somewhat  hastily, and fired.    \"Hit again!\" shouted those who had run forward to examine the mark.  \"_Half_ the bullet cut off by the nail-head!\"    Some of the more enthusiastic of Dick's friends cheered lustily, but the  most of the hunters were grave and silent, for they knew Jim's powers,  and felt that he would certainly do his best.  Jim now stepped up to the  line, and, looking earnestly at the mark, threw forward his rifle.    At that moment our friend Crusoe--tired of tormenting his mother--  waddled stupidly and innocently into the midst of the crowd of men, and,  in so doing, received Henri's heel and the full weight of his  elephantine body on its fore-paw.  The horrible and electric yell that  instantly issued from his agonised throat could only be compared, as Joe  Blunt expressed it, \"to the last dyin' screech o' a bustin' steam  biler!\"  We cannot say that the effect was startling, for these  backwoodsmen had been born and bred in the midst of alarms, and were so  used to them that a \"bustin' steam biler\" itself, unless it had blown  them fairly off their legs, would not have startled them.  But the  effect, such as it was, was sufficient to disconcert the aim of Jim  Scraggs, who fired at the same instant, and missed the nail by a  hair's-breadth.    Turning round in towering wrath, Scraggs aimed a kick at the poor pup,  which, had it taken effect, would certainly have terminated the innocent  existence of that remarkable dog on the spot, but quick as lightning  Henri interposed the butt of his rifle, and Jim's shin met it with a  violence that caused him to howl with rage and pain.    \"Oh! pardon me, broder,\" cried Henri, shrinking back, with the drollest  expression of mingled pity and glee.    Jim's discretion, on this occasion, was superior to his valour; he  turned away with a coarse expression of anger and left the ground."]]]
