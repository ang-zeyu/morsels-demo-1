[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20842"],[0,"Dreams (#3)"],[1,"emarked--to talk in a dream with a certain person, to dream a  whole conversation, and then, all of a sudden, a singular phenomenon  strikes the attention of the dreamer. He perceives that he does not  speak, that he has not spoken, that his interlocutor has not uttered a  single word, that it was a simple exchange of thought between them, a  very clear conversation, in which, nevertheless, nothing has been heard.  The phenomenon is easily enough explained. It is in general necessary  for us to hear sounds in a dream. From nothing we can make nothing. And  when we are not provided with sonorous material, a dream would find it  hard to manufacture sonority.    There is much more to say about the sensations of touch than about those  of hearing, but I must hasten. We could talk for hours about the  singular phenomena which result from the confused sensations of touch  during sleep. These sensations, mingling with the images which occupy  our visual field, modify them or arrange them in their own way. Often in  the midst of the night the contact of our body with its light clothing  makes itself felt all at once and reminds us that we are lightly  clothed. Then, if our dream is at the moment taking us through the  street, it is in this simple attire that we present ourselves to the  gaze of the passers-by, without their appearing to be astonished by it.  We are ourselves astonished in the dream, but that never appears to  astonish other people. I cite this dream because it is frequent. There  is another which many of us must have experienced. It consists of  feeling oneself flying through the air or floating in space. Once having  had this dream, one may be quite sure that it will reappear; and every  time that it recurs the dreamer reasons in this way: \"I have had before  now in a dream the illusion of flying or floating, but this time it is  the real thing. It has certainly proved to me that we may free ourselves  from the law of gravitation.\" Now, if you wake abruptly from this dream,  you can analyze it without difficulty, if you undertake it immediately.  You will see that you feel very clearly that your feet are not touching  the earth. And, nevertheless, not believing yourself asleep, you have  lost sight of the fact that you are lying down. Therefore, since you are  not lying down and yet your feet do not feel the resistance of the  ground, the conclusion is natural that you are floating in space. Notice  this also: when levitation accompanies the flight, it is on one side  only that you make an effort to fly. And if you woke at that moment you  would find that this side is the one on which you are lying, and that  the sensation of effort for flight coincides with the real sensation  given you by the pressure of your body against the bed. This sensation  of pressure, dissociated from its cause, becomes a pure and simple  sensation of effort and, joined to the illusion of floating in space, is  sufficient to produce the dream.    It is interesting to see that these sensations of pressure, mounting, so  to speak, to the level of our visual field and taking advantage of the  luminous dust which fills it, effect its transformation into forms and  colors. M. Max Simon tells of having a strange and somewhat painful  dream. He dreamt that he was confronted by two piles of golden coins,  side by side and of unequal height, which for some reason or other he  had to equalize. But he could not accomplish it. This produced a feeling  of extreme anguish. This feeling, growing moment by moment, finally  awakened him. He then perceived that one of his legs was caught by the  folds of the bedclothes in such a way that his two feet were on  different levels and it was impossible for him to bring them together.  From this the sensation of inequality, making an irruption into the  visual field and there encountering (such at least is the hypothesis  which I propose) one or more yellow spots, expressed itself visually by  the inequality of the two piles of gold pieces. There is, then, immanent  in the tactile sensations during sleep, a tendency to visualize  themselves and enter in this form into the dream.    More important still than the tactile sensations, properly speaking, are  the sensations which pertain to what is sometimes called internal touch,  deep-seated sensations emanating from all points of the organism and,  more particularly, from the viscera. One cannot imagine the degree of  sharpness, of acuity, which may be obtained during sleep by these  interior sensations. They doubtless already exist as well during waking.  But we are then distracted by practical action. We live outside of  ourselves. But sleep makes us retire into ourselves. It happens  frequently that persons subject to laryngitis, amygdalitis, etc., dream  that they are attacked by their affection and experience a disagreeable  tingling on the side of their throat. When awakened, they feel nothing  more, and believe it an illusion; but a few hours later the illusion  becomes a reality. There are cited maladies and grave accidents, attacks  of epilepsy, cardiac affections, etc., which have been foreseen and, as  it were, prophesied in dreams. We need not be astonished, then, that  philosophers like Schopenhauer have seen in the dream a reverberation,  in the heart of consciousness, of perturbations emanating from the  sympathetic nervous system; and that psychologists like Schemer have  attributed to each of our organs the power of provoking a  well-determined kind of dream which represents it, as it were,  symbolically; and finally that physicians like Artigues have written  treatises on the semeiological value of dreams, that is to say, the  method of making use of dreams for the diagnosis of certain maladies.  More recently, M. Tissie, of whom we have just spoken, has shown how  specific dreams are connected with affections of the digestive,  respiratory, and circulatory apparatus.    I will summarize what I have just been saying. When we are sleeping  naturally, it is not necessary to believe, as has often been supposed,  that our senses are closed to external sensations. Our senses continue  to be active. They act, it is true, with less precision, but in  compensation they embrace a host of \"subjective\" impressions which pass  unperceived when we are awake--for then we live in a world of  perceptions common to all men--and which reappear in sleep, when we live  only for ourselves. Thus our faculty of sense perception, far from being  narrowed during sleep at all points, is on the contrary extended, at  least in certain directions, in its field of operations. It is true that  it often loses in energy, in _tension_, what it gains in extension. It  brings to us only confused impressions. These impressions are the  materials of our dreams. But they are only the materials, they do not  suffice to produce them.    They do not suffice to produce them, because they are vague and  indeterminate. To speak only of those that play the principal role, the  changing colors and forms, which deploy before us when our eyes are  closed, never have well-defined contours. Here are black lines upon a  white background. They may represent to the dreamer the page of a book,  or the facade of a new house with dark blinds, or any number of other  things. Who will choose? What is the form that will imprint its decision  upon the indecision of this material? This form is our memory.    Let us note first that the dream in general creates nothing. Doubtless  there may be cited some examples of artistic, literary and scientific  production in dreams. I will recall only the well-known anecdote told of  Tartini, a violinist-composer of the eighteenth century. As he was  trying to compose a sonata and the muse remained recalcitrant, he went  to sleep and he saw in a dream the devil, who seized his violin and  played with master hand the desired sonata. Tartini wrote it out from  memory when he woke. It has come to us under the name of \"The Devil's  Sonata.\" But it is very difficult, in regard to such old cases, to  distinguish between history and legend. We should have auto-observations  of certain authenticity. Now I have not been able to find anything more  than that of the contemporary English novelist, Stevenson. In a very  curious essay entitled \"A Chapter on Dreams,\" this author, who is  endowed with a rare talent for analysis, explains to us how the most  original of his stories have been composed or at least sketched in  dreams. But read the chapter carefully. You will see that at a certain  time in his life Stevenson had come to be in an habitual psychical state  where it was very hard for him to say whether he was sleeping or waking.  That appears to me to be the truth. When the mind creates, I would say  when it is capable of giving the effort of organization and synthesis  which is necessary to triumph over a certain difficulty, to solve a  problem, to produce a living work of the imagination, we are not really  asleep, or at least that part of ourselves which labors is not the same  as that which sleeps. We cannot say, then, that it is a dream. In sleep,  properly speaking, in sleep which absorbs our whole personality, it is  memories and only memories which weave the web of our dreams. But often  we do not recognize them. They may be very old memories, forgotten  during waking hours, drawn from the most obscure depths of our past;  they may be, often are, memories of objects that we have perceived  distractedly, almost unconsciously, while awake. Or they may be  fragments of broken memories which have been picked up here and there  and mingled by chance, composing an incoherent and unrecognizable whole.  Before these bizarre assemblages of images which present no plausible  significance, our intelligence (which is far from surrendering the  reasoning faculty during sleep, as has been asserted) seeks an  explanation, tries to fill the lacunae. It fills them by"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20846"],[0,"Handwork in Wood (#3)"],[1,"hazardous job, Fig. 15.    As each load comes down to the _banking grounds_, Fig. 14, or log  dump, it is stopped opposite long parallel skids. The wrapping chains  are unhooked and the lower log on the skid side is worked out with  cant-hooks till the whole load flattens out. The logs are then  \"decked\" on immense piles, sometimes a mile long and filling the whole  river from bank to bank. A decking chain 300 feet long is sometimes  required to roll the logs to their proper places. Here the logs rest  till the spring freshets come. This completes the transportation by  land.    [Illustration: Fig. 14. Banking Grounds.]    With the coming of the spring thaw, the river bed is filled with a  freshet of water which seizes and carries the logs down stream. Many  on the banks, however, have to be started on their way, and this is  called \"breaking out the roll ways.\" They often start on their water  journey with a great crash.    [Illustration: Fig. 15. The Sleigh Haul.]    [Illustration: Fig. 16. Sacking the Rear.]    Now comes _the drive_, an arduous and often perilous task. Some of the  men are stationed along the shores to prevent the logs from lodging  or floating into bays or setbacks. Some stand at the heads of bars or  islands, where with pike poles they shove off the logs that might stop  there and form a jam; others follow \"sacking the rear\" to clean out  such logs as may have become stranded. This \"sacking the rear\"  takes most of the time, Fig. 16. While \"on the drive\" men often work  fourteen hours a day, a good part of the time up to their waists in  ice water. Their boots are shod with \"caulks,\" or spikes, to keep  them from slipping on the logs, and they carry either pike poles or  peaveys, Fig. 17. The latter are similar to cant-hooks, except that  they have sharp pikes at their ends. So armed, they have to \"ride  any kind of a log in any water, to propel a log by jumping on it, by  rolling it squirrel fashion with the feet, by punting it as one would  a canoe; to be skilful in pushing, prying, and poling other logs from  the quarter deck of the same cranky craft.\" Altho the logs are carried  by the river, they have to be \"driven\" with amazing skill and bravery.    [Illustration: Fig. 17. Log Driving on the Ausable River.]    The climax of hardship and courage is reached when a \"_jam_\" is  formed, Fig. 18. Sometimes one or two logs are caught in such a way  as to be locked or jammed and then soon other logs begin to accumulate  behind them, till the whole river is full of a seemingly inextricable  mass. Sometimes these jams can be loosened by being pulled apart, one  log at a time. A hundred men can pull out an amazing number of logs  in a day. The problem always is to set free or cut out certain \"key\"  logs, which lock the whole mass. Following is a description by Stewart  Edward White of the breaking of such a jam:        The crew were working desperately. Down on the heap somewhere,      two logs were crossed in such a manner as to lock the whole.      They sought those logs.        Thirty feet above the bed of the river six men clamped their      peaveys into the soft pine; jerking, pulling, lifting, sliding      the great logs from their places. Thirty feet below, under      the threatening face, six other men coolly picked out and set      adrift one by one, the timbers not inextricably imbedded. From      time to time the mass creaked, settled, perhaps even moved      a foot or two; but always the practised rivermen, after a      glance, bent more eagerly to their work. * * * Suddenly the      six men below the jam scattered. * * * holding their peaveys      across their bodies, they jumped lightly from one floating log      to another in the zig-zag to shore. * * *    [Illustration: Fig. 18. Log Jam. Adirondack Mountains, New York.]        In the meantime a barely perceptible motion was communicating      itself from one particle to another thru the center of the      jam. * * * The crew redoubled its exertion, clamping its      peaveys here and there, apparently at random, but in reality      with the most definite of purposes. A sharp crack exploded      immediately underneath. There could no longer exist any doubt      as to the motion, altho it was as yet sluggish, glacial. Then      in silence a log shifted--in silence and slowly--but with      irresistible force * * * other logs in all directions      up-ended. * * *        Then all at once down by the face something crashed, the      entire stream became alive. It hissed and roared, it shrieked,      groaned, and grumbled. At first slowly, then more rapidly, the      very fore-front of the center melted inward and forward and      downward, until it caught the fierce rush of the freshet and      shot out from under the jam. Far up-stream, bristling and      formidable, the tons of logs, grinding savagely together,      swept forward. * * *        Then in a manner wonderful to behold, thru the smother of foam      and spray, thru the crash and yell of timbers, protesting the      flood's hurrying, thru the leap of destruction, the drivers      zigzagged calmly and surely to the shore.    Sometimes cables have to be stretched across the chasm, and special  rigging devised to let the men down to their dangerous task and more  especially to save them from danger when the crash comes.    [Illustration: Fig. 20. Splash-Dam.]    [Illustration: Fig. 21. Logs in Boom. Glens Falls, New York.]    In case such efforts are unavailing, it is necessary to \"shoot\" the  jam with dynamite. Another device resorted to where the supply of  water is insufficient is the _splash-dam_, Fig. 20. The object is to  make the operator independent of freshets, by accumulating a head of  water and then, by lifting the gates, creating an artificial freshet,  sufficient to float the timber down stream.    [Illustration: Fig. 22. A Sorting Jack.]    Thus by one means and another, the logs are driven along until caught  by a boom, Fig. 21, which consists of a chain of logs stretched across  the river, usually at a mill. Since the river is a common carrier, the  drives of a number of logging companies may float into the mill pond  together. But each log is stamped on both ends, so that it can be  sorted out, Fig. 22, and sent into the boom of its owner.      MECHANICAL METHODS IN LUMBERING.    The operations described above are those common in the lumber regions  of the northeast and the Lake States. But special conditions produce  special methods. A very effective device where streams are small is  the flume, Fig. 23. This is a long wooden trough thru which water is  led, and the logs floated end on. It is sometimes many miles long; in  one case in California twenty-five miles.    In the South where there is no snow, logs are largely brought out to  the railway or river by being hung under immense two-wheeled trucks,  called slip-tongue carts, drawn by mules, Fig. 24. The wheels are  nearly eight feet in diameter.    [Illustration: Fig. 23. Six Mile Flume. Adirondack Mountains, New  York.]    Some kinds of wood are so heavy that they will not float at all, and  some sink so readily that it does not pay to transport them by river.  In such cases temporary railways are usually resorted to.    [Illustration: Fig. 24. Hauling Logs by Mules. Oscilla, Georgia.]    On the Pacific coast, where the forests are dense, the trees of  enormous size, and no ice road is possible, still other special  methods have been devised. On so great a scale are the operations  conducted that they may properly be called engineering feats. Consider  for a moment the size of the trees: red fir ranges from five to  fifteen feet in diameter, is commonly two hundred fifty feet high, and  sometimes three hundred twenty-five feet high. The logs are commonly  cut twenty-five feet long, and such logs often weigh thirty to forty  tons each, and the logs of a single tree may weigh together one  hundred fifty tons. The logging of such trees requires special  appliances. Until recently all the improved methods were in forms of  transportation, the felling still being done by hand with very long  saws, Fig. 25, but now even the felling and sawing of logs in the  forest is partly done by machinery.    [Illustration: Fig. 25. A Twenty-Five Foot Saw used for Crosscutting  Big Logs.]    [Illustration: Fig. 26. Hauling Big Logs by Donkey Engine.]    To work the saw, power is supplied by a steam or gasoline engine  mounted upon a truck which can be taken readily from place to place.  As the maximum power required is not over ten-horse-power, the  apparatus is so light that it can be moved about easily. The saw can  be adjusted to cut horizontally, vertically, or obliquely, and hence  is used for sawing into lengths as well as for felling.    _Falling beds._ Since the weight of a two hundred fifty foot fir is  such that if the impact of its fall be not gradually checked the force  with which it strikes the ground may split the trunk, a bed for its  fall is prepared by the swampers. Usually piles of brush are placed as  buffers along the \"falling line\" so that the trunk will strike these.  If the tree stands on the hill side, it is thrown up hill, in order to  shorten the fall.    After the felling comes the trimming of branches and knots and  \"rossing\" of bark, to lessen the friction in sliding along the  skidway.    _The skidway._ By the skidway in the Puget Sound region is meant a  corduroy road. This is constructed of trunks of trees ranging from a  foot to two feet in diameter. These are \"rossed,\" that is, stripped of  their bark and laid across the road, where they are held in place by  pegs driven into the ground, and by strips spiked upon the tops of the  logs. If possible they are laid in swampy places to keep the surface  damp and slippery. At turns in the road, pulleys are hung, thru which  the hauling cables pass. The skidway runs to the railway siding or  water's edge. Over these skidways the logs"]]]
