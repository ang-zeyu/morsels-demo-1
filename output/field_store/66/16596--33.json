Who, I may ask, when viewing  the international character of the Cause, its far-flung ramifications, the  increasing complexity of its affairs, the diversity of its adherents, and  the state of confusion that assails on every side the infant Faith of God,  can for a moment question the necessity of some sort of administrative  machinery that will insure, amid the storm and stress of a struggling  civilization, the unity of the Faith, the preservation of its identity,  and the protection of its interests? To repudiate the validity of the  assemblies of the elected ministers of the Faith of Baha'u'llah would be  to reject those countless Tablets of Baha'u'llah and 'Abdu'l-Baha wherein  They have extolled the station of the \"trustees of the Merciful,\"  enumerated their privileges and duties, emphasized the glory of their  mission, revealed the immensity of their task, and warned them of the  attacks they must needs expect from the unwisdom of their friends as well  as from the malice of their enemies. It is surely for those to whose hands  so priceless a heritage has been committed to prayerfully watch lest the  tool should supersede the Faith itself, lest undue concern for the minute  details arising from the administration of the Cause obscure the vision of  its promoters, lest partiality, ambition, and worldliness tend in the  course of time to becloud the radiance, stain the purity, and impair the  effectiveness of the Faith of Baha'u'llah.          Situation in Egypt      I have already referred in my previous communications of January 10, 1926,  and February 12, 1927, to the perplexing yet highly significant situation  that has arisen in Egypt as a result of the final judgment of the Muslim  ecclesiastical court in that country pronounced against our Egyptian  brethren, denouncing them as heretics, expelling them from their midst,  and refusing them the application and benefits of the Muslim Law. I have  also acquainted you with the difficulties with which they are faced, and  the plans which they have conceived, in order to obtain from the Egyptian  civil authorities a recognition of the independent status of their Faith.  It must be explained, however, that in the Muslim countries of the Near  and Middle East, with the exception of Turkey which has lately abolished  all ecclesiastical courts under its rule, every recognized religious  community has, in matters of personal status such as marriage, divorce and  inheritance, its own ecclesiastical court, totally independent of the  civil and criminal tribunals, there being in such instances no civil code  promulgated by the government and embracing all the different religious  communities. Hitherto regarded as a sect of Islam, the Baha'is of Egypt,  who for the most part are of Muslim origin, and unable therefore to refer  for purposes of marriage and divorce to the recognized religious tribunals  of any other denomination, find themselves in consequence in a delicate  and anomalous position. They have naturally resolved to refer their case  to the Egyptian Government, and have prepared for this purpose a petition  to be addressed to the head of the Egyptian Cabinet. In this document they  have set forth the motives compelling them to seek recognition from their  rulers, have asserted their readiness and their qualifications to exercise  the functions of an independent Baha'i court, have assured them of their  implicit obedience and loyalty to the State, and of their abstinence from  interference in the politics of their country. They have also decided to  accompany the text of their petition with a copy of the judgment of the  Court, with selections from Baha'i writings, and with the document that  sets forth the principles of their national constitution which, with few  exceptions, is identical with the Declaration and By-laws promulgated by  your Assembly.    I have insisted that the provisions of their constitution should, in all  its details, conform to the text of the Declaration of Trust and By-laws  which you have established, endeavoring thereby to preserve the uniformity  which I feel is essential in all Baha'i National Constitutions. I would  like, therefore, in this connection to request of you what I have already  intimated to them, that whatever amendments you may decide to introduce in  the text of the Declaration and By-laws should be duly communicated to me,  that I may take the necessary steps for the introduction of similar  changes in the text of all other National Baha'i Constitutions.    It will be readily admitted that in view of the peculiar privileges  granted to recognized religious Communities in the Islamic countries of  the Near and Middle East, the request which is to be submitted by the  Baha'i Egyptian National Assembly to the Government of Egypt is more  substantial and far-reaching than what has already been granted by the  Federal Authorities to your Assembly. For their petition is chiefly  concerned with a formal request for recognition by the highest civil  authorities in Egypt of the Egyptian National Spiritual Assembly as a  recognized and independent Baha'i court, free and able to execute and  apply in all matters of personal status such laws and ordinances as have  been promulgated by Baha'u'llah in the Kitab-i-Aqdas.    I have asked them to approach informally the authorities concerned, and to  make the fullest possible inquiry as a preliminary measure to the formal  presentation of their historic petition. Any assistance which your  Assembly, after careful deliberation, may find it advisable to offer to  the valiant promoters of the Faith in that land will be deeply  appreciated, and will serve to confirm the solidarity that characterizes  the Baha'i Communities of East and West. Whatever the outcome of this  mighty issue--and none can fail to appreciate the incalculable  possibilities of the present situation--we can rest assured that the  guiding Hand that has released these forces will, in His inscrutable  wisdom and by His omnipotent power, continue to shape and direct their  course for the glory, the ultimate emancipation, and the unqualified  recognition of His Faith.    Your true brother,  Shoghi.    Haifa, Palestine.  February 27, 1929.            THE WORLD ORDER OF BAHA'U'LLAH: FURTHER CONSIDERATIONS          The World Order of Baha'u'llah: Further Considerations      To the beloved of the Lord and the handmaids of the Merciful throughout  the West.    Dearly-beloved co-workers:    Amid the reports that have of late reached the Holy Land, most of which  witness to the triumphant march of the Cause, a few seem to betray a  certain apprehension regarding the validity of the institutions which  stand inseparably associated with the Faith of Baha'u'llah. These  expressed misgivings appear to be actuated by certain whisperings which  have emanated from quarters which are either wholly misinformed regarding  the fundamentals of the Baha'i Revelation, or which deliberately contrive  to sow the seeds of dissension in the hearts of the faithful.          A Blessing in Disguise      Viewed in the light of past experience, the inevitable result of such  futile attempts, however persistent and malicious they may be, is to  contribute to a wider and deeper recognition by believers and unbelievers  alike of the distinguishing features of the Faith proclaimed by  Baha'u'llah. These challenging criticisms, whether or not dictated by  malice, cannot but serve to galvanize the souls of its ardent supporters,  and to consolidate the ranks of its faithful promoters. They will purge  the Faith from those pernicious elements whose continued association with  the believers tends to discredit the fair name of the Cause, and to  tarnish the purity of its spirit. We should welcome, therefore, not only  the open attacks which its avowed enemies persistently launch against it,  but should also view as a blessing in disguise every storm of mischief  with which they who apostatize their faith or claim to be its faithful  exponents assail it from time to time. Instead of undermining the Faith,  such assaults, both from within and from without, reinforce its  foundations, and excite the intensity of its flame. Designed to becloud  its radiance, they proclaim to all the world the exalted character of its  precepts, the completeness of its unity, the uniqueness of its position,  and the pervasiveness of its influence.    I do not feel for one moment that such clamor, mostly attributable to  impotent rage against the resistless march of the Cause of God, can ever  distress the valiant warriors of the Faith. For these heroic souls,  whether they be contending in America's impregnable stronghold, or  struggling in the heart of Europe, and across the seas as far as the  continent of Australasia, have already abundantly demonstrated the  tenacity of their Faith and the abiding value of their conviction.          Distinguishing Features of Baha'i World Order      I feel it, however, incumbent upon me by virtue of the responsibility  attached to the Guardianship of the Faith, to dwell more fully upon the  essential character and the distinguishing features of that world order as  conceived and proclaimed by Baha'u'llah. I feel impelled, at the present  stage of the evolution of the Baha'i Revelation, to state candidly and  without any reservation, whatever I regard may tend to insure the  preservation of the integrity of the nascent institutions of the Faith. I  strongly feel the urge to elucidate certain facts, which would at once  reveal to every fair-minded observer the unique character of that Divine  Civilization the foundations of which the unerring hand of Baha'u'llah has  laid, and the essential elements of which the Will and Testament of  'Abdu'l-Baha has disclosed. I consider it my duty to warn every beginner  in the Faith that the promised glories of the Sovereignty which"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19299"],[0,"The Will And Testament of ‘Abdu'l-Bahá (#3)"],[1,"and  urging the peoples to service. He rested not a moment, till the fame of  the Cause of God was noised abroad in the world and the celestial strains  from the Abha Kingdom roused the East and the West. The beloved of God  must also follow the same example. This is the secret of faithfulness,  this is the requirement of servitude to the Threshold of Baha!    The disciples of Christ forgot themselves and all earthly things, forsook  all their cares and belongings, purged themselves of self and passion, and  with absolute detachment scattered far and wide and engaged in calling the  peoples of the world to the divine guidance; till at last they made the  world another world, illumined the surface of the earth, and even to their  last hour proved self-sacrificing in the pathway of that beloved One of  God. Finally in various lands they suffered glorious martyrdom. Let them  that are men of action follow in their footsteps!    O my loving friends! After the passing away of this wronged one, it is  incumbent upon the A_gh_san (Branches), the Afnan (Twigs) of the Sacred  Lote-Tree, the Hands (pillars) of the Cause of God and the loved ones of  the Abha Beauty to turn unto Shoghi Effendi--the youthful branch branched  from the two hallowed and sacred Lote-Trees and the fruit grown from the  union of the two offshoots of the Tree of Holiness,--as he is the sign of  God, the chosen branch, the Guardian of the Cause of God, he unto whom all  the A_gh_san, the Afnan, the Hands of the Cause of God and His loved ones  must turn. He is the Interpreter of the Word of God and after him will  succeed the first-born of his lineal descendents.    The sacred and youthful branch, the Guardian of the Cause of God, as well  as the Universal House of Justice to be universally elected and  established, are both under the care and protection of the Abha Beauty,  under the shelter and unerring guidance of the Exalted One (may my life be  offered up for them both). Whatsoever they decide is of God. Whoso obeyeth  him not, neither obeyeth them, hath not obeyed God; whoso rebelleth  against him and against them hath rebelled against God; whoso opposeth him  hath opposed God; whoso contendeth with them hath contended with God;  whoso disputeth with him hath disputed with God; whoso denieth him hath  denied God; whoso disbelieveth in him hath disbelieved in God; whoso  deviateth, separateth himself and turneth aside from him hath in truth  deviated, separated himself and turned aside from God. May the wrath, the  fierce indignation, the vengeance of God rest upon him! The mighty  stronghold shall remain impregnable and safe through obedience to him who  is the Guardian of the Cause of God. It is incumbent upon the members of  the House of Justice, upon all the A_gh_san, the Afnan, the Hands of the  Cause of God to show their obedience, submissiveness and subordination  unto the Guardian of the Cause of God, to turn unto him and be lowly  before him. He that opposeth him hath opposed the True One, will make a  breach in the Cause of God, will subvert His Word and will become a  manifestation of the Center of Sedition. Beware, beware, lest the days  after the ascension (of Baha'u'llah) be repeated when the Center of  Sedition waxed haughty and rebellious and with Divine Unity for his excuse  deprived himself and perturbed and poisoned others. No doubt every  vainglorious one that purposeth dissension and discord will not openly  declare his evil purposes, nay rather, even as impure gold, will he seize  upon divers measures and various pretexts that he may separate the  gathering of the people of Baha. My object is to show that the Hands of  the Cause of God must be ever watchful and so soon as they find anyone  beginning to oppose and protest against the Guardian of the Cause of God,  cast him out from the congregation of the people of Baha and in no wise  accept any excuse from him. How often hath grievous error been disguised  in the garb of truth, that it might sow the seeds of doubt in the hearts  of men!    O ye beloved of the Lord! It is incumbent upon the Guardian of the Cause  of God to appoint in his own life-time him that shall become his  successor, that differences may not arise after his passing. He that is  appointed must manifest in himself detachment from all worldly things,  must be the essence of purity, must show in himself the fear of God,  knowledge, wisdom and learning. Thus, should the first-born of the  Guardian of the Cause of God not manifest in himself the truth of the  words:--\"The child is the secret essence of its sire,\" that is, should he  not inherit of the spiritual within him (the Guardian of the Cause of God)  and his glorious lineage not be matched with a goodly character, then must  he, (the Guardian of the Cause of God) choose another branch to succeed  him.    The Hands of the Cause of God must elect from their own number nine  persons that shall at all times be occupied in the important services in  the work of the Guardian of the Cause of God. The election of these nine  must be carried either unanimously or by majority from the company of the  Hands of the Cause of God and these, whether unanimously or by a majority  vote, must give their assent to the choice of the one whom the Guardian of  the Cause of God hath chosen as his successor. This assent must be given  in such wise as the assenting and dissenting voices may not be  distinguished (i.e., secret ballot).    O friends! The Hands of the Cause of God must be nominated and appointed  by the Guardian of the Cause of God. All must be under his shadow and obey  his command. Should any, within or without the company of the Hands of the  Cause of God disobey and seek division, the wrath of God and His vengeance  will be upon him, for he will have caused a breach in the true Faith of  God.    The obligations of the Hands of the Cause of God are to diffuse the Divine  Fragrances, to edify the souls of men, to promote learning, to improve the  character of all men and to be, at all times and under all conditions,  sanctified and detached from earthly things. They must manifest the fear  of God by their conduct, their manners, their deeds and their words.    This body of the Hands of the Cause of God is under the direction of the  Guardian of the Cause of God. He must continually urge them to strive and  endeavor to the utmost of their ability to diffuse the sweet savors of  God, and to guide all the peoples of the world, for it is the light of  Divine Guidance that causeth all the universe to be illumined. To  disregard, though it be for a moment, this absolute command which is  binding upon everyone, is in no wise permitted, that the existent world  may become even as the Abha Paradise, that the surface of the earth may  become heavenly, that contention and conflict amidst peoples, kindreds,  nations and governments may disappear, that all the dwellers on earth may  become one people and one race, that the world may become even as one  home. Should differences arise, they shall be amicably and conclusively  settled by the Supreme Tribunal, that shall include members from all the  governments and peoples of the world.    O ye beloved of the Lord! In this sacred Dispensation, conflict and  contention are in no wise permitted. Every aggressor deprives himself of  God's grace. It is incumbent upon everyone to show the utmost love,  rectitude of conduct, straightforwardness and sincere kindliness unto all  the peoples and kindreds of the world, be they friends or strangers. So  intense must be the spirit of love and loving kindness, that the stranger  may find himself a friend, the enemy a true brother, no difference  whatsoever existing between them. For universality is of God and all  limitations earthly. Thus man must strive that his reality may manifest  virtues and perfections, the light whereof may shine upon everyone. The  light of the sun shineth upon all the world and the merciful showers of  Divine Providence fall upon all peoples. The vivifying breeze reviveth  every living creature and all beings endued with life obtain their share  and portion at His heavenly board. In like manner, the affections and  loving kindness of the servants of the One True God must be bountifully  and universally extended to all mankind. Regarding this, restrictions and  limitations are in no wise permitted.    Wherefore, O my loving friends! Consort with all the peoples, kindreds and  religions of the world with the utmost truthfulness, uprightness,  faithfulness, kindliness, good-will and friendliness, that all the world  of being may be filled with the holy ecstasy of the grace of Baha, that  ignorance, enmity, hate and rancor may vanish from the world and the  darkness of estrangement amidst the peoples and kindreds of the world may  give way to the Light of Unity. Should other peoples and nations be  unfaithful to you show your fidelity unto them, should they be unjust  toward you show justice towards them, should they keep aloof from you  attract them to yourselves, should they show their enmity be friendly  towards them, should they poison your lives, sweeten their souls, should  they inflict a wound upon you, be a salve to their sores. Such are the  attributes of the sincere! Such are the attributes of the truthful.    And now, concerning the House of Justice which God hath ordained as the  source of all good and freed from all error, it must be elected by  universal suffrage, that is, by the believers. Its members must be  manifestations of the fear of God and daysprings of knowledge and  understanding, must be steadfast in God's faith and the well-wishers of  all mankind. By this House is meant the Universal House of Justice, that  is, in all countries a secondary House of Justice must be instituted, and  these secondary Houses of Justice must elect the members of the Universal  one. Unto this body all things must be referred. It enacteth all  ordinances "]]]
