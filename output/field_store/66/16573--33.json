Very short of breath by nature, my mother had to keep me as a little  child almost sitting upright in bed. After I had outgrown that and as  a big girl could run around and play well enough, I still had much  trouble with shortness of breath in the beginning of my singing  lessons. For years I practised breathing exercises every day without  singing, and still do so with especial pleasure, now that everything  that relates to the breath and the voice has become clear to me. Soon  I had got so far that I could hold a swelling and diminishing tone  from fifteen to eighteen seconds.    I had learned this: to draw in the abdomen and diaphragm, raise the  chest and hold the breath in it by the aid of the ribs; in letting out  the breath _gradually_ to relax the body and to let the chest fall  slowly. To do everything _thoroughly_ I doubtless exaggerated it all.  But since for twenty-five years I have breathed in this way almost  exclusively, with the utmost care, I have naturally attained great  dexterity in it; and my abdominal and chest muscles and my diaphragm,  have been strengthened to a remarkable degree. Yet I was not  satisfied.    A horn player in Berlin with the power of holding a very long breath,  once told me in answer to a question, that he drew in his abdomen and  diaphragm very strongly, but immediately relaxed his abdomen again as  soon as he began to play. I tried the same thing with the _best  results_. Quite different, and very naive, was the answer I once got  from three German orchestral horn players in America. They looked at  me in entire bewilderment, and appeared not to understand in the least  my questions as to how they breathed. Two of them declared that the  best way was not to think about it at all. But when I asked if their  teachers had never told them how they should breathe, the third  answered, after some reflection, \"Oh, yes!\" and pointed in a general  way to his stomach. The first two were right, in so far as too violent  inhalation of breath is really undesirable, because thereby _too much_  air is drawn in. But such ignorance of the subject is disheartening,  and speaks ill for the conservatories in which the players were  trained, whose performances naturally are likely to give art a black  eye.    Undoubtedly I took in too much air in breathing, and thereby stiffened  various organs, depriving my muscles of their elasticity. Yet, with  all my care and preparation, I often, when I had not given special  thought to it, had too little breath, rather than too much. I felt,  too, after excessive inhalation, as if I must emit a certain amount of  air before I began to sing. Finally I abandoned all superfluous  drawing in of the abdomen and diaphragm, inhaled but little, and began  to pay special attention to emitting the smallest possible amount of  breath, which I found very serviceable.    How do I breathe now?    My diaphragm I scarcely draw in consciously, my abdomen never; I feel  the breath fill my lungs, and my upper ribs expand. Without raising  my chest especially high, I force the breath against it, and hold it  fast there. At the same time I raise my palate high and prevent the  escape of breath through the nose. The diaphragm beneath reacts  against it, and furnishes pressure from the abdomen. Chest, diaphragm,  the closed epiglottis, and the raised palate all form a supply chamber  for the breath.    Only in this way is the breath under the control of the singer,  through the pressure against the chest tension muscles. (_This is very  important._) From now on the breath must be emitted from the supply  chamber very sparingly, but with unceasing uniformity and strength,  without once being held back, to the vocal cords, which will further  regulate it as far as possible. The more directly the breath pressure  is exerted against the chest,--one has the feeling, in this, of  singing the tone against the chest whence it must be _pressed_  out,--the less breath flows through the vocal cords, and the less,  consequently, are these overburdened.    In this way, under control, in the passage formed for it above the  tongue by that organ, it reaches the resonance chambers prepared for  it by the raising and lowering of the soft palate, and those in the  cavities of the head. Here it forms whirling currents of tone; these  now must circulate uninterrupted for as long as possible and fill all  the accessible resonating surfaces, which must be maintained in an  elastic state. This is necessary to bring the tone to its perfect  purity. Not till these currents have been sufficiently used up and  passed through the \"bell,\" or cup-shaped resonating cavity, of the  mouth and lips, may it be allowed to stream from the mouth unimpeded.  Yet the _sensation_ must be as if the breath were constantly escaping  from the mouth.    To observe and keep under control these many functions, singly or in  conjunction, forms the ceaseless delight of the never failing fountain  of song study.    Thus, in shaping the passage for the breath, the larynx, tongue, and  palate, which can be placed at will, are employed. The vocal cords,  which can best be imagined as inner lips, we have under control  neither as beginners nor as artists. _We do not feel them._ We first  become conscious of them through the controlling apparatus of the  breath, which teaches us to _spare_ them, by emitting breath through  them in the least possible quantity and of even pressure, whereby a  steady tone can be produced. I even maintain that all is won, when--as  Victor Maurel says--we regard them directly as the breath regulators,  and relieve them of all overwork through the controlling apparatus of  the chest-muscle tension.    Through the form prepared by the larynx, tongue, and palate, we can  direct the breath, previously under control and regulation, toward the  particular resonating surfaces on the palate, or in the cavities of  the head, which are suitable to each tone. This rule remains the same  for all voices.    As soon as the breath leaves the larynx, it is divided. (Previously,  in inhalation, a similar thing happens; but this does not concern us  immediately, and I prefer to direct the singer's chief attention to  the second occurrence.) One part may press toward the palate, the  other toward the cavities of the head. The division of the breath  occurs regularly, from the deepest bass to the highest tenor or  soprano, step for step, vibration for vibration, without regard to sex  or individuality. Only the differing size or strength of the vocal  organs through which the breath flows, the breathing apparatus, or the  skill with which they are used, are different in different  individuals. The seat of the breath, the law of its division, as well  as the resonating surfaces, are always the same and are differentiated  at most through difference of habit.          SECTION III    OF THE BREATH AND WHIRLING CURRENTS    (SINGING FORWARD)      The veriest beginner knows that in order to use the breath to the  fullest advantage, it must remain very long diffused back in the  mouth. A mistaken idea of \"singing forward\" misleads most to _press_  it forward and thus allow it to be speedily dissipated.    The column of breath coming in an uninterrupted stream from the  larynx, must, as soon as it flows into the form prepared for it  according to the required tone, by the tongue and palate, fill this  form, soaring through all its corners, with its vibrations. It makes  whirling currents, which circulate in the elastic form surrounding it,  and it must remain there till the tone is high enough, strong enough,  and sustained enough to satisfy the judgment of the singer as well as  the ear of the listener. Should there be lacking the least element of  pitch, strength, or duration, the tone is imperfect and does not meet  the requirement.    Learning and teaching to hear is the first task of both pupil and  teacher. One is impossible without the other. It is the most difficult  as well as the most grateful task, and it is the only way to reach  perfection.    Even if the pupil unconsciously should produce a flawless tone, it is  the teacher's duty to acquaint him clearly with the _causes_ of it. It  is not enough to sing well; one must also know how one does it. The  teacher must tell the pupil constantly, making him describe clearly  his sensations in singing, and understand fully the physiological  factors that cooeperate to produce them.    The sensations in singing must coincide with mine as here described,  if they are to be considered as correct; for mine are based logically  on physiological causes and correspond precisely with the operation of  these causes. Moreover, all my pupils tell me--often, to be sure, not  till many months have passed--how exact my explanations are; how  accurately, on the strength of them, they have learned to feel the  physiological processes. They have learned, slowly, to be sure, to  become conscious of their errors and false impressions; for it is very  difficult to ascertain such mistakes and false adjustments of the  organs. False sensations in singing and disregarded or false ideas of  physiological processes cannot immediately be stamped out. A long time  is needed for the mind to be able to form a clear image of those  processes, and not till then can knowledge and improvement be  expected. The teacher must repeatedly explain the physiological  processes, the pupil repeatedly disclose every confusion and  uncertainty he feels, until the perfect consciousness of his  sensations in singing is irrevocably impressed upon his memory, that  is, has become a habit.    Among a hundred singers hardly one can be found whose single tones  meet every requirement. And among a thousand listeners, even among  teachers, and among artists, hardly one hears it.    I admit that such perfect"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19138"],[0,"Resonance in Singing and Speaking (#3)"],[1," the larynx.    The pterygoid muscles, which move the under jaw forward and backward,  do not connect with the larynx, so their action does not compress that  organ or in any way impede the action of the vocal apparatus. A  relaxed under jaw allows freer action of the vocal cords and ampler  resonance. The under jaw should drop little by little as the voice  ascends the scale, thus opening the mouth slightly wider with each  rise in the pitch of the tone. In ascending the scale it is well to  open the throat a little wider as you ascend. The delivery will be  much easier, and the tone produced will be much better. At the highest  pitch of the voice the mouth should open to its full width. At the  same time care must be taken _not_ to draw the corners of the mouth  back, as in smiling, because this lessens the resonance of the tone  and gives it a flat sound.    The under jaw must have considerable latitude of motion in  pronunciation, but by all means avoid chewing of the words and cutting  off words by closing the jaw instead of finishing them by the use of  the proper articulating organs, which are the tongue and lips.      THE SOFT PALATE    Writers on the voice have almost universally claimed that the  principal office of the soft palate is to shut off the nasal and head  cavities from the throat, and to force the column of vibrations out  through the mouth, thus allowing none, or at most a very small part,  to pass into the nasal passages.    This contention implies that the vibrations are imparted to the upper  cavities, if at all, through the walls of the palate itself, and not  through an opening behind the palate. This is entirely at variance  with the facts as verified by my own experience and observation and  the observation of others who are expert specialists. The true office  of the soft palate is to modify the opening into the nose and thus  attune the resonant cavities to the pitch and timbre of the note given  by the vocal cords and pharynx. To develop the vowel sounds, the soft  palate should be drawn forward, allowing a free passage into the nose;  it should be closed only to form the consonants which require a  forcible expulsion of breath from the mouth.    The uvula, the pendulous tip of the soft palate, serves as a valve to  more accurately adjust the opening behind the soft palate to the pitch  of the voice. In producing a low tone the soft palate is relaxed and  hangs low down and far forward. As the voice ascends the scale the  tension of the soft palate is increased and it is elevated and the  uvula shortened, thus decreasing the opening behind the palate, but  never closing it. In fact the larger the opening that can be  maintained, the broader and better the tone. The author was himself  unable fully to appreciate this until he had become able to sense the  position of the soft palate during vocalization.      THE HARD PALATE AND TEETH    The hard palate and upper teeth form in part the walls of the mouth.  As they are solid fixtures, nothing can be done in the way of  training. They furnish a point of impingement in articulation, and  play their part in sympathetic resonance.    The bones which form the roof of the mouth serve also for the floor of  the nasal cavity.    The under teeth also serve as walls of resistance to support the  tongue during the performance of its functions.      THE NASAL AND HEAD CAVITIES    The nasal and head cavities are resonating chambers incapable of  special training, but their form, size, and the use made of them have  a wonderful effect upon the resonance of the voice. If the vibrations  are strong here, all other parts will vibrate in harmonious action.    When responding to the perfectly focused tone the thin walls of the  cavities and the contained air vibrate with surprising force, often  for the moment blinding the singer when sounding a note intensely.    Having in my surgical work demonstrated the existence of a hitherto  unrecognized connecting passage or canal between the air cavities of  the face and those of the forehead,[2] the play of resonance in the  cavities above the nostrils is more easily understood. The function of  the cavities known as the _frontal sinuses_ (see Fig. 1) has long been  a mystery, but now that their direct connection with the lower  cavities is proven, and the great significance of resonance is also  beginning to be recognized, the mystery disappears. The same may be  said of the other sinuses--_ethmoidal_, _sphenoidal_, and _maxillary_,  and their interconnection.    [Footnote 2: Dr. Fillebrown's paper, _A Study of the Relation of the  Frontal Sinus to the Antrum_, was read before the American Dental  Association, at Saratoga, August 5, 1895. His investigation showed  that the funnel-shaped passage known as the _infundibulum_ extends  from the _frontal sinus_ directly into the antrum or _maxillary  sinus_. This was afterwards confirmed by Dr. W.H. Cryer and others.]      INFLUENCE OF THE RESONANCE CAVITIES ON THE PITCH OF THE TONE    In instruments changes in the length and form of the resonance  chambers affect the pitch as well as the quality of the tone. This is  demonstrated in the trombone, French horn, and other wind instruments.  The lengthening of the tube of the trombone lowers the pitch of the  tone, and the projection of the hand of the performer into the bell of  the French horn has the effect of raising the pitch of the sound. If  the variation in length or form is only slight, the result is sharp or  flat, and the instrument is out of tune. In the human instrument all  the organs act together as a unit; so the fact that the cavities alone  may affect the pitch is practically of no great significance.      THE TONGUE    The tongue and the lips are the articulating organs, and the former  has an important part to play in altering through its movements the  shape of the mouth cavity.    The tip of the tongue should habitually rest against the under front  teeth. The tip of the tongue, however, must frequently touch the roof  of the mouth near the upper front teeth, as when pronouncing the  consonants _c_, _d_, _g_ or _j_, _l_, _n_, _s_, and _t_. The back part  of the tongue must rise a little to close against the soft palate when  pronouncing _g_ hard, and _k_, and hard _c_, _q_, and _x_. The soft  palate comes down so far to meet the tongue that the elevation of the  latter need be but very slight.    When speaking, the demand is not so imperative, but when singing, the  body of the tongue should lie as flat as possible, so as to enlarge  the mouth, especially when giving the vowel sounds.    If the tongue is sometimes disposed to be unruly, it is the result of  rigidity or misplaced effort in the surrounding parts. This tendency  will only be aggravated by artificial restraint of any kind. The true  way is to dismiss tongue consciousness, _let go_, and a normal  flexibility will easily manifest itself.      THE LIPS    The lips, equally with the tongue, are organs of articulation. The  upper lip is the principal factor of the two; the under lip seems to  follow the lead of the upper. The lips need much training, and it can  readily be given them. While practising to educate the lips, both lips  should be projected forward and upward, at the same time pronouncing  the word \"too.\" Bring the edge of the upper lip as high toward the  nose as possible in practice. This will bring the corners of the mouth  forward and lift the lips clear and free from the teeth, and thus add  one more resonance cavity. This position of the lips also gives  freedom for pronunciation. \"The upper lip plays the most active part  in the shaping of the vowels. It should never be drawn against the  teeth when producing vowel tones; indeed, there should be often a  little space between the upper lip and the teeth, so that the  vibrations of the sound-waves can have free play.\"      THE NOSTRILS    The nostrils should be dilated as much as possible, as a free, wide,  open nose gives a free, well-rounded tone, while a contracted nostril  induces the nasal tone so much dreaded. A proper training of the  facial muscles makes this dilation possible. Lifting the upper lip and  projecting it forward aids the action to a great degree.    There is a strong tendency to unity of action between the nostrils and  the lips and the soft palate. The soft palate moves downward and  forward when the upper lip protrudes and the nostrils dilate, and  moves backward and upward when the nostrils are contracted and the  upper lip allowed to rest upon the teeth.    As a rule the best singers have full, round, wide, open nostrils,  either given by nature or acquired by practice.      THE FACE    Not only must the lips and nose be trained, but the muscles of the  face also. These muscles are capable, if educated, of doing important  service.    The artist on the operatic stage or the speaker on the platform,  without facial expression begotten of muscular activity, may lessen by  half his power over an audience. To train the facial muscles is a  complicated task. To do this, stand before a mirror and make all the  faces ever thought of by a schoolboy to amuse his schoolmates. Raise  each corner of the lip, wrinkle the nose, quilt the forehead, grin,  laugh. The grimaces will not enter into a performance, but their  effect upon it will be markedly beneficial.          CHAPTER II    THE SPEAKING VOICE AND PRONUNCIATION      A generation ago the speaking voice was even less understood than the  singing voice. That the two were intimately connected was but half  surmised. Only an occasional person recognized what is now generally  conceded, that a good way to improve the speaking voice is to  cultivate the singing voice.    In 1887 I published a paper in the _Independent Practitioner_ defining  the singing voice and the speaking voice as identical, and contending  that the training for each should be the same so far as tone formation  is involved, a"]]]
