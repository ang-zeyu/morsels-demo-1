I was in Paris immediately after the days  of the Commune and followed, with an old General, the line the troops  had taken in the fight for the city. In the Rue St-Honore were some of  the fiercest combats, for the regulars fought their way from house to  house down this street to turn the positions the Communists took up in  the Champs Elysees and the gardens of the Tuileries. The British Embassy  had become a hospital, and all the houses which had not been burned  looked as though they had stood a bombardment. There were bullet  splashes on all the walls, and I remember that Voisin's looked even  more battered and hopeless than did most of its neighbours.    The diplomats have always had an affection for Voisin's, perhaps because  of its nearness to the street of the Embassies; and in the \"eighties\"  the attaches of the British Embassy used to breakfast there every day.  Nowadays, the _clientele_ seems to me to be a mixture of the best type  of the English and Americans passing through Paris, and the more elderly  amongst the statesmen, who were no doubt the dashing young blades of  twenty-five years ago. The two comfortable ladies who sit near the door  at the desk, and the little show-table of the finest fruit seem to me  never to have changed, and there is still the same quiet-footed,  unhurrying service which impressed me when first I made the acquaintance  of the restaurant. It is one of the dining-places where one feels that  to dine well and unhurriedly is the first great business of life, and  that everything else must wait at the dinner-hour. The proprietor,  grey-headed and distinguished-looking, goes from table to table saying a  word or two to the _habitues_, and there is a sense of peace in the  place--a reflection of the sunshine and calm of Provence, whence the  founder of the restaurant came.    The great glory of Voisin's is its cellar of red wines, its Burgundies  and Bordeaux. The Bordeaux are arranged in their proper precedence, the  wines from the great vineyards first, and the rest in their correct  order down to mere bourgeois tipple. Against each brand is the price of  the vintage of all the years within a drinkable period, and the man who  knew the wine-list of Voisin's thoroughly would be the greatest  authority in the world on claret.    Mr. Rowland Strong, in his book on Paris, tells how, one Christmas Eve,  he took an Englishman to dine at Voisin's, and how that Englishman  demanded plum-pudding. The _maitre-d'hotel_ was equal to the occasion.  He was polite but firm, and his assertion that \"The House of Voisin does  not serve, has never served, and will never serve, plum-pudding\" settled  the matter.    If the Anglais and Voisin's may be said to have much of their interest  in their \"past,\" Paillard's should be taken as a restaurant which is the  type and parent of the present up-to-date restaurant. The white  restaurant on the Boulevard des Italiens has kept at the top of the tree  for many years, and has sent out more culinary missionaries to improve  the taste of dining man than any other establishment in Paris. Joseph,  who brought the Marivaux to such a high pitch of fame before he  emigrated to London, came from Paillard's and so did Frederic of the  Tour d'Argent, of whom I shall have something to say later on. Henri of  the Gaillon, Notta, Charles of Foyot's--all were trained at Paillard's.    The restaurant has its history, and its long list of great patrons. _Le  Desir de Roi_, which generally appears in the menu of any important  dinner at Paillard's, and which has _foie gras_ as its principal  component, has been eaten by a score of kings at one time or another,  our own gracious Majesty heading the list. The restaurant at first was  contained in one small room. Then the shop of Isabelle, the Jockey Club  flower-girl, which was next door, was acquired, and lastly another  little shop was taken in, the entrance changed from the front to its  present position at the side, the accountant's desk put out of sight,  and the little musicians' gallery built--for Paillard's has moved with  the time and now has a band of Tziganes, much to the grief of men like  myself who prefer conversation to music as the accompaniment of a meal.  The restaurant as it is with its white walls and bas-reliefs of cupids  and flowers, its green Travertine panels let into the white pilasters,  its chandeliers of cut glass, is very handsome. M. Paillard, hair parted  in the middle and with a small moustache, irreproachably attired,  wearing a grey frock-coat by day, and a \"smoking\" and black tie in the  evening, is generally to be seen superintending all arrangements, and  there is a _maitre-d'hotel_ who speaks excellent English, and a head  waiter with whiskers who deserted to Henri, but subsequently returned,  who is also an accomplished linguist.    Amongst the specialities of the house are _Pomme Otero_ and _Pomme  Georgette_, both created, I fancy, by Joseph when he was at Paillard's,  _Homard Cardinal_, _Filet de Sole a la Russe_, _Sole Paillard_, _Filet  de Sole Kotchoubey_, _Timbale de queues d'Ecrevisses Mantua_, _Cote de  Boeuf braise Empire_, _Pommes Macaire_, _Filet Paillard_, _Supreme de  Volaille Grand Duc_, _Rouennais Paillard_, _Baron d'agneau Henri IV._,  _Poularde Archiduc_, _Poularde a la Derby_, _Poularde Wladimir_, _Filet  de Selle Czarine_, _Becasse au Fumet_, _Rouennais a la Presse_,  _Terrine de Foie Gras a la gelee au Porto_, _Perdreau et Caille  Paillard_.    Two menus of dinners M. Paillard has given me, one a very noble feast,  to the length of which I am a conscientious objector but which I print,  presently, in full, and the other a banquet of lesser grandeur with  _Creme Germiny_, _Barbue Paillard_, _Ortolans en surprise_, _Salade  Ideale_, and many other good things in it from which I select the  following dishes as making a typical little Paillard feast for two, the  price of which would not be a king's ransom:--                       Caviar frais.                   Consomme Viveur.               Filets de Sole Joinville.                Coeurs de Filet Rachel.                      Pommes Anna.           Haricots Verts a la Touranquelle.      An Ice or some iced Fruits and some Coffee.    And this repast might well be washed down by a bottle of Montrachet  1885, with a glass of Fine Champagne Palais de St-Cloud to follow.    This is the menu of the banquet:--                                  |      Le Caviar Imperial.                                |    Les Huitres de Burnham.                                |              -----                                |     Le Consomme Paillard.                                |       Pailles Parmesan.                                |       La Creme d'Aretin.                                |              -----                                | Les Croustades a la Victoria.      _Eau-de-vie Russe._       |              -----                                |    La Carpe a la Chambord.      _Chablis Moutonne._       |     Le Turbot a l'Amiral.                                |              -----      _Johannisberg 1893._      | Le Baron de Pauillac persille.                                |      Les pommes Macaire.      _Mouton Rothschild        |      Le Veloute Favorite.             1875._             |              -----                                |        Le Desir de Roi.      _Clos Vougeot 1858._      |              -----                                |     Les Becasses au fumet.      _Moet brut 1884._         |      La Salade Esperance.                                |              -----      _Fine Champagne des       |   Les Asperges d'Argenteuil        Tuileries 1800._        |         Sce Mousseline.                                |              -----                                |     La Pyramide a l'Ananas.                                |   Le Souffle aux Mandarines.                                |     Macarons et Gaufrettes                                |            Chantilly.                                |              -----                                |     La Corbeille de Fruits.                                |              Cafe.    What the cost of this feast would be it is difficult to estimate, and I  will not even hazard a guess.    I asked, last spring, an Englishman who knows his Paris better than most  Parisians, what he would consider a typical breakfast, dinner, and  supper in Paris, and he answered, \"Breakfast _chez Henri_ at the  Gaillon, dine at the Ritz, and sup at Durand's.\"    There are two Henri's in Paris, one is the little hotel and English bar,  and the other is in the Place Gaillon. Henri's Restaurant Gaillon had  its days of celebrity in the Second Empire, and then sank, as the Maison  Grossetete, from grace until Henri Drouet, leaving Paillard's,  established himself there. When I first knew the restaurant it had  Paillard's cookery, but not Paillard's prices; but now that the whole of  the _monde qui dine_ has found it out, I fancy that the scale of prices  has risen to a level with that of the parent restaurant. The first room  is the best one to breakfast or dine in, for the others on hot days are  apt to be very stuffy; and it is well to order a table by telephone in  advance. Henri's, it always seems to me, has a more tempting table of  cold viands, pates, and tarts and _friandises_ set out than any other  restaurateur's, and many of the _habitues_ at lunch-time order eggs or  fish, and then turn their attention to the cold buffet.    When dining at Henri's the _Consomme Fortunato_, the _filets de sole_ of  the restaurant, the _Noisettes de Veau Port Mahon_, the _Crepes des  Gourmets_ should be remembered. If you want a dinner for twelve, you  cannot do better than order the following, or rather select dishes from  it, for it is unreasonably lengthy as it stands:--        Hors-d'oeuvre a la Russe.

But my uncle,  who never thought even of such sublunary matters, knew nothing of this.  Without noticing my abstraction, the Professor began reading the  puzzling cryptograph all sorts of ways, according to some theory of his  own. Presently, rousing my wandering attention, he dictated one precious  attempt to me.    I mildly handed it over to him. It read as follows:          <i>mmessunkaSenrA.icefdoK.segnittamurtn      ecertserrette,rotaivsadua,ednecsedsadne      lacartniiilrJsiratracSarbmutabiledmek      meretarcsilucoYsleffenSnI.</i>      I could scarcely keep from laughing, while my uncle, on the contrary,  got in a towering passion, struck the table with his fist, darted out of  the room, out of the house, and then taking to his heels was presently  lost to sight.          CHAPTER 3    AN ASTOUNDING DISCOVERY      \"What is the matter?\" cried the cook, entering the room; \"when will  master have his dinner?\"    \"Never.\"    \"And, his supper?\"    \"I don't know. He says he will eat no more, neither shall I. My uncle  has determined to fast and make me fast until he makes out this  abominable inscription,\" I replied.    \"You will be starved to death,\" she said.    I was very much of the same opinion, but not liking to say so, sent her  away, and began some of my usual work of classification. But try as I  might, nothing could keep me from thinking alternately of the stupid  manuscript and of the pretty Gretchen.    Several times I thought of going out, but my uncle would have been angry  at my absence. At the end of an hour, my allotted task was done. How to  pass the time? I began by lighting my pipe. Like all other students, I  delighted in tobacco; and, seating myself in the great armchair, I began  to think.    Where was my uncle? I could easily imagine him tearing along some  solitary road, gesticulating, talking to himself, cutting the air with  his cane, and still thinking of the absurd bit of hieroglyphics. Would  he hit upon some clue? Would he come home in better humor? While these  thoughts were passing through my brain, I mechanically took up the  execrable puzzle and tried every imaginable way of grouping the letters.  I put them together by twos, by threes, fours, and fives--in vain.  Nothing intelligible came out, except that the fourteenth, fifteenth,  and sixteenth made <i>ice</i> in English; the eighty-fourth, eighty-fifth,  and eighty-sixth, the word <i>sir</i>; then at last I seemed to find the  Latin words <i>rota, mutabile, ira, nec, atra</i>.    \"Ha! there seems to be some truth in my uncle's notion,\" thought I.    Then again I seemed to find the word <i>luco</i>, which means sacred wood.  Then in the third line I appeared to make out <i>labiled</i>, a perfect  Hebrew word, and at the last the syllables mere, are, mer, which were  French.    It was enough to drive one mad. Four different idioms in this absurd  phrase. What connection could there be between ice, sir, anger, cruel,  sacred wood, changing, mother, are, and sea? The first and the last  might, in a sentence connected with Iceland, mean sea of ice. But what  of the rest of this monstrous cryptograph?    I was, in fact, fighting against an insurmountable difficulty; my brain  was almost on fire; my eyes were strained with staring at the parchment;  the whole absurd collection of letters appeared to dance before my  vision in a number of black little groups. My mind was possessed with  temporary hallucination--I was stifling. I wanted air. Mechanically I  fanned myself with the document, of which now I saw the back and then  the front.    Imagine my surprise when glancing at the back of the wearisome puzzle,  the ink having gone through, I clearly made out Latin words, and among  others craterem and terrestre.    I had discovered the secret!    It came upon me like a flash of lightning. I had got the clue. All you  had to do to understand the document was to read it backwards. All the  ingenious ideas of the Professor were realized; he had dictated it  rightly to me; by a mere accident I had discovered what he so much  desired.    My delight, my emotion may be imagined, my eyes were dazzled and I  trembled so that at first I could make nothing of it. One look, however,  would tell me all I wished to know.    \"Let me read,\" I said to myself, after drawing a long breath.    I spread it before me on the table, I passed my finger over each letter,  I spelled it through; in my excitement I read it out.    What horror and stupefaction took possession of my soul. I was like a  man who had received a knock-down blow. Was it possible that I really  read the terrible secret, and it had really been accomplished! A man had  dared to do--what?    No living being should ever know.    \"Never!\" cried I, jumping up. \"Never shall my uncle be made aware of the  dread secret. He would be quite capable of undertaking the terrible  journey. Nothing would check him, nothing stop him. Worse, he would  compel me to accompany him, and we should be lost forever. But no; such  folly and madness cannot be allowed.\"    I was almost beside myself with rage and fury.    \"My worthy uncle is already nearly mad,\" I cried aloud. \"This would  finish him. By some accident he may make the discovery; in which case,  we are both lost. Perish the fearful secret--let the flames forever bury  it in oblivion.\"    I snatched up book and parchment, and was about to cast them into the  fire, when the door opened and my uncle entered.    I had scarcely time to put down the wretched documents before my uncle  was by my side. He was profoundly absorbed. His thoughts were evidently  bent on the terrible parchment. Some new combination had probably struck  him while taking his walk.    He seated himself in his armchair, and with a pen began to make an  algebraical calculation. I watched him with anxious eyes. My flesh  crawled as it became probable that he would discover the secret.    His combinations I knew now were useless, I having discovered the one  only clue. For three mortal hours he continued without speaking a word,  without raising his head, scratching, rewriting, calculating over and  over again. I knew that in time he must hit upon the right phrase. The  letters of every alphabet have only a certain number of combinations.  But then years might elapse before he would arrive at the correct  solution.    Still time went on; night came, the sounds in the streets ceased--and  still my uncle went on, not even answering our worthy cook when she  called us to supper.    I did not dare to leave him, so waved her away, and at last fell asleep  on the sofa.    When I awoke my uncle was still at work. His red eyes, his pallid  countenance, his matted hair, his feverish hands, his hectically flushed  cheeks, showed how terrible had been his struggle with the impossible,  and what fearful fatigue he had undergone during that long sleepless  night. It made me quite ill to look at him. Though he was rather severe  with me, I loved him, and my heart ached at his sufferings. He was so  overcome by one idea that he could not even get in a passion! All his  energies were focused on one point. And I knew that by speaking one  little word all this suffering would cease. I could not speak it.    My heart was, nevertheless, inclining towards him. Why, then, did I  remain silent? In the interest of my uncle himself.    \"Nothing shall make me speak,\" I muttered. \"He will want to follow in  the footsteps of the other! I know him well. His imagination is a  perfect volcano, and to make discoveries in the interests of geology he  would sacrifice his life. I will therefore be silent and strictly keep  the secret I have discovered. To reveal it would be suicidal. He would  not only rush, himself, to destruction, but drag me with him.\"    I crossed my arms, looked another way and smoked--resolved never to  speak.    When our cook wanted to go out to market, or on any other errand, she  found the front door locked and the key taken away. Was this done  purposely or not? Surely Professor Hardwigg did not intend the old woman  and myself to become martyrs to his obstinate will. Were we to be  starved to death? A frightful recollection came to my mind. Once we had  fed on bits and scraps for a week while he sorted some curiosities. It  gave me the cramp even to think of it!    I wanted my breakfast, and I saw no way of getting it. Still my  resolution held good. I would starve rather than yield. But the cook  began to take me seriously to task. What was to be done? She could not  go out; and I dared not.    My uncle continued counting and writing; his imagination seemed to have  translated him to the skies. He neither thought of eating nor drinking.  In this way twelve o'clock came round. I was hungry, and there was  nothing in the house. The cook had eaten the last bit of bread. This  could not go on. It did, however, until two, when my sensations were  terrible. After all, I began to think the document very absurd. Perhaps  it might only be a gigantic hoax. Besides, some means would surely be  found to keep my uncle back from attempting any such absurd expedition.  On the other hand, if he did attempt anything so quixotic, I should not  be compelled to accompany him. Another line of reasoning partially  decided me. Very likely he would make the discovery himself when I  should have suffered starvation for nothing. Under the influence of  hunger this reasoning appeared admirable. I determined to tell all.    The question now arose as to how it was to be done. I was still dwelling  on the thought, when he rose and put on his hat.    What! go out and lock us in? Never!    \"Uncle,\" I began.    He did not appear even to hear me.    \"Professor Hardwigg,\" I cried.    \"What,\" he retorted, \"did you speak?\"    \"How about the key?\"    \"What key--the key of the door?\"    \"No--of these horrible hieroglyphics?\"    He looked at me from under his spectacles, and started at the odd  expression of my face."]]]
