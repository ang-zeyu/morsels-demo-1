Nevertheless this is precisely similar to what one will find in most  treatises on physics for schools and colleges if he turns to the subject  of light. For instance, I quote from a book edited by an eminent man of  science in England, the book bearing the date 1873.    \"There are two theories of light; one the _emissive_ theory; ... the  other, the _vibratory_ theory;\" just as if the emissive or corpuscular  theory was not mathematically untenable sixty years ago, and  experimentally demonstrated to be false more than forty years ago.  Unless one were treating of the history of the science of optics there  is no reason why the latter theory should be mentioned any more than the  old theory of the formation of the earth. It is not to be presumed that  any one whose opinion is worth the asking still thinks it possible that  the old view may be the true one because the evidence is demonstrable  against it, yet while the undulatory theory prevails there are not a few  persons well instructed otherwise who still write and speak as though  light has some sort of independent existence as distinguished from  so-called radiant heat; in other words, that the heat and light we  receive from the sun are specifically different.    A brief survey of our present knowledge of this form of energy will  help to show how far wrong the common conception of light is. For  fifteen years it has been common to hear heat spoken of as a mode of  molecular motion, and sometimes it has been characterized as  _vibratory_, and most persons have received the impression that the  vibratory motion was an actual change of position of the molecular in  space instead of a _change of form_. Make a ring of wire five or six  inches in diameter, and, holding it between the thumb and finger at the  twisted ends, pluck it with a finger of the other hand; the ring will  vibrate, have three nodes, and will give a good idea of the character of  the vibration that constitutes what we call heat. This vibratory motion  may have a greater or less amplitude, and the energy of the vibration  will be as the square of that amplitude. But the vibrating molecule  gives up its energy of vibration to the surrounding ether; that is to  say, it loses amplitude precisely as a vibrating tuning fork will lose  it. The ether transmits the energy it has received in every direction  with the velocity of 186,000 miles per second, whether the amplitude be  great or small, and whether the number of vibrations be many or few. It  is quite immaterial. The _form_ of this energy which the ether transmits  is _undulatory_; that is to say, not unlike that of the wave upon a  loose rope when one end of it is shaken by the hand. As every shake of  the hand starts a wave in the rope, so will every vibration of a part of  the molecule start a wave in the ether. Now we have several methods for  measuring the wave lengths in ether, and we also know the velocity of  movement. Let v = velocity, l = wave length, and n = number of  vibrations per second, then n = v/l, and by calculation the value of n  varies within wide limits, say from 1 x 10^{14} to 20 x 10^{14}. But all  vibrating bodies are capable of vibrating in several periods, the  longest period being called the fundamental, and the remainder, which  stand in some simple ratios to the fundamental, are called _harmonics_.  Each of these will give to the ether its own particular vibratory  movement, so that a single molecule may be constantly giving out rays of  many wave lengths precisely as a sounding bell gives out sounds of  various pitches at one and the same time.    Again, when these undulations in the ether fall upon other molecules the  latter may reflect them away or they may absorb them, in which case the  absorbing molecules are themselves made to vibrate with increased  amplitude, and we say they have been heated. Some molecules, such as  carbon, appear to be capable of stopping undulations of all wave lengths  and to be heated by them; others are only affected by undulations of  particular wave lengths, or of wave lengths between special limits. In  this case it is a species of sympathetic vibration. The distinction  between the molecular vibrations, and the undulations in ether that  result from them, must be kept in mind, as must also the effect of the  undulations that fall upon other molecules. To one the name _heat_ is  applied, to the other the name of _radiant energy_ is given; and it  matters not whether the undulations be long or short, the same molecule  may give out both.    Now let a prism be placed in the path of such rays of different wave  length from a single molecule, and what is called the dispersive action  of the prism will separate the rays in the order of their wave lengths,  the longer waves being less refracted than the shorter ones; but the  energy of any one of these will depend upon the _amplitude of  undulation_, which in turn will depend upon the amplitude of vibration  of the part of the molecule that originated it, but in general the  longer waves have greater amplitude, though not necessarily so.  Consequently, if a thermopile be so placed as to receive these various  rays, and their energy be measured by its absorption on the face of the  pile, each one would be found to heat it, the longer waves more than the  shorter ones, simply because the amplitude is greater, but for no other  reason, for it is possible, and in certain cases is the fact, that a  short wave has as much or more energy than a longer one. If the eye  should take the place of the thermopile it would be found that some of  these rays did not affect it at all, while some would produce the  sensation of light. This would be the case with any waves having a wave  length between the limits of, say, 1-37,000 of an inch and 1-60,000 of  an inch; any shorter waves will not produce the sensation of light. If  instead of the eye a piece of paper washed in a solution of the chloride  of silver should be placed where the dispersed rays should fall upon it,  it would be found that only the shorter waves would affect it at all,  and among these shorter ones would be some of those rays which the eye  could not perceive at all.    It was formerly inferred from these facts that the heat rays, the light  rays, and the chemical rays were different in quality; and some of the  late books treating upon this very subject represent a solar spectrum as  being made up of a heat spectrum, a light spectrum, and an actinic or  chemical spectrum, and the idea has often been made to do duty as an  analogy in trinitarian theology; nevertheless it is utterly wrong and  misleading. There is no such thing as an actinic spectrum; that is,  there are no such rays as special chemical rays; any given ray will do  chemical work if it falls upon the proper kind of matter. For instance,  while it is true that for such salts of silver as the chloride, the  bromide, etc., the shorter waves are most efficient; by employing salts  of iron one may get photographic effects with wave lengths much too long  for any eye to perceive. Capt. Abney has photographed the whole solar  spectrum from one end to the other, which is sufficient evidence that  there are no special chemical rays. As to the eye itself, certain of the  wave lengths are competent to produce the sensation we call light, but  the same ray will heat the face of a thermopile or produce photographic  effects if permitted to act upon the proper material, so there is no  more propriety in calling it a light ray than in calling it a heat ray  or an actinic ray. What the ray will do depends solely upon what kind of  matter it falls upon, and all three of these names, _light_, _heat_, and  _actinism_, are names of _effects of radiant energy_. The retina of the  eye is itself demonstrably a photographic plate having a substance  called purpurine secreted by appropriate glands spread over it in place  of the silver salts of common photography. This substance purpurine is  rapidly decomposed by radiant energy of certain wave lengths, becoming  bleached, but the decomposition is attended by certain molecular  movements; the ends of the optic nerves, which are also spread over the  retina, are shaken by the disrupting molecules, and the disturbance is  the origin of what we call the sensation of light. But the sensation is  generally a compound one, and when all wave lengths which are competent  to affect the retina are present, the compound effect we call white or  whiteness. When some of the rays are absent, as, for instance, the  longer ones, the optical effect is one we call green or greenness; and  the special physiological mechanism for producing the sensation may be  either three special sets of nerves, capable of sympathetic vibration to  waves of about 1-39,000, 1-45,000, and 1-55,000 of an inch in length, as  Helmholtz has suggested, or, as seems to the writer more probable, the  substance purpurine is a highly complex organic substance made up of  molecules of different sizes and requiring wave lengths of different  orders to decompose them, so that a part of the substance may be quite  disintegrated, while other molecules may be quite entire throughout the  visual space. This will account for most of the chromatic effects of  vision, for complementary colors, and for color blindness, by supposing  that the purpurine is not normally constituted. This is in accordance  with experimental photography, for it has been found that the long waves  will act only upon heavier molecules. It is true vision may be good when  there is no purpurine, but there is no doubt but that this substance is  secreted in the eye, and that it is"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21091"],[0,"The Life of William Ewart Gladstone, Vol. 1 (of 3) (#3)"],[1,"gossip, salutation, or compliment, he passes on his way.

It has been so in other countries; I trust it will       be so in this country.--GLADSTONE.      The dawn of the life of the great and famous man who is our subject in  these memoirs has been depicted with homely simplicity by his own hand.  With this fragment of a record it is perhaps best for me to begin our  journey. 'I was born,' he says, 'on December 29, 1809,' at 62 Rodney  Street, Liverpool. 'I was baptized, I believe, in the parish church of  St. Peter. My godmother was my elder sister Anne, then just seven years  old, who died a perfect saint in the beginning of the year 1829. In her  later years she lived in close relations with me, and I must have been  much worse but for her. Of my godfathers, one was a Scotch episcopalian,  Mr. Fraser of ----, whom I hardly ever saw or heard of; the other a  presbyterian, Mr. G. Grant, a junior partner of my father's.' The child  was named William Ewart, after his father's friend, an immigrant Scot  and a merchant like himself, and father of a younger William Ewart, who  became member for Liverpool, and did good public service in parliament.         Before proceeding to the period of my childhood, properly       so-called, I will here insert a few words about my family. My       maternal grandfather was known as Provost Robertson of Dingwall, a       man held, I believe, in the highest respect. His wife was a       Mackenzie of [Coul]. His circumstances must have been good.         Of his three sons, one went into the army, and I recollect him as       Captain Robertson (I have a seal which he gave me, a three-sided       cairngorm. Cost him 71/2 guineas). The other two took mercantile       positions. When my parents made a Scotch tour in 1820-21 with, I       think, their four sons, the freedom of Dingwall was presented to us       all,[1] with my father; and there was large visiting at the houses       of the Ross-shire gentry. I think the line of my grandmother was       stoutly episcopalian and Jacobite; but, coming outside the western       highlands, the first at least was soon rubbed down. The provost, I       think, came from a younger branch of the Robertsons of Struan.         On my father's side the matter is more complex. The history of the       family has been traced at the desire of my eldest brother and my       own, by Sir William Fraser, the highest living authority.[2] He has       carried us up to a rather remote period, I think before Elizabeth,       but has not yet been able to connect us with the earliest known       holders of the name, which with the aid of charter-chests he hopes       to do. Some things are plain and not without interest. They were a       race of borderers. There is still an old Gledstanes or Gladstone       castle. They formed a family in Sweden in the seventeenth century.       The explanation of this may have been that, when the union of the       crowns led to the extinction of border fighting they took service       like Sir Dugald Dalgetty under Gustavus Adolphus, and in this case       passed from service to settlement. I have never heard of them in       Scotland until after the Restoration, otherwise than as persons of       family. At that period there are traces of their having been fined       by public authority, but not for any ordinary criminal offence.       From this time forward I find no trace of their gentility. During       the eighteenth century they are, I think, principally traced by a       line of maltsters (no doubt a small business then) in Lanarkshire.       Their names are recorded on tombstones in the churchyard of Biggar.       I remember going as a child or boy to see the representative of       that branch, either in 1820 or some years earlier, who was a small       watchmaker in that town. He was of the same generation as my       father, but came, I understood, from a senior brother of the       family. I do not know whether his line is extinct. There also seem       to be some stray Gladstones who are found at Yarmouth and in       Yorkshire.[3]                                      ANCESTRY         My father's father seems from his letters to have been an excellent       man and a wise parent: his wife a woman of energy. There are       pictures of them at Fasque, by Raeburn. He was a merchant, in       Scotch phrase; that is to say, a shopkeeper dealing in corn and       stores, and my father as a lad served in his shop. But he also sent       a ship or ships to the Baltic; and I believe that my father, whose       energy soon began to outtop that of all the very large family, went       in one of these ships at a very early age as a supercargo, an       appointment then, I think, common. But he soon quitted a nest too       small to hold him. He was born in December 1764: and I have (at       Hawarden) a reprint of the _Liverpool Directory_ for 178-, in which       his name appears as a partner in the firm of Messrs. Corrie, corn       merchants.         Here his force soon began to be felt as a prominent and then a       foremost member of the community. A liberal in the early period of       the century, he drew to Mr. Canning, and brought that statesman as       candidate to Liverpool in 1812, by personally offering to guarantee       his expenses at a time when, though prosperous, he could hardly       have been a rich man. His services to the town were testified by       gifts of plate, now in the possession of the elder lines of his       descendants, and by a remarkable subscription of six thousand       pounds raised to enable him to contest the borough of Lancaster,       for which he sat in the parliament of 1818.         At his demise, in December 1851, the value of his estate was, I       think, near L600,000. My father was a successful merchant, but       considering his long life and means of accumulation, the result       represents a success secondary in comparison with that of others       whom in native talent and energy he much surpassed. It was a large       and strong nature, simple though hasty, profoundly affectionate and       capable of the highest devotion in the lines of duty and of love. I       think that his intellect was a little intemperate, though not his       character. In his old age, spent mainly in retirement, he was our       constant [centre of] social and domestic life. My mother, a       beautiful and admirable woman, failed in health and left him a       widower in 1835, when she was 62.    He then turns to the records of his own childhood, a period that he  regarded as closing in September 1821, when he was sent to Eton. He  begins with one or two juvenile performances, in no way differing from  those of any other infant,--_navita projectus humi_, the mariner flung  by force of the waves naked and helpless ashore. He believes that he was  strong and healthy, and came well through his childish ailments.         My next recollection belongs to the period of Mr. Canning's first       election for Liverpool, in the month of October of the year 1812.       Much entertaining went on in my father's house, where Mr. Canning       himself was a guest; and on a day of a great dinner I was taken       down to the dining room. I was set upon one of the chairs,       standing, and directed to say to the company 'Ladies and       gentlemen.'         I have, thirdly, a group of recollections which refer to Scotland.       Thither my father and mother took me on a journey which they made,       I think, in a post-chaise to Edinburgh and Glasgow as its principal       points. At Edinburgh our sojourn was in the Royal Hotel, Princes       Street. I well remember the rattling of the windows when the castle       guns were fired on some great occasion, probably the abdication of       Napoleon, for the date of the journey was, I think, the spring of       1814.                                EARLY RECOLLECTIONS         In this journey the situation of Sanquhar, in a close Dumfriesshire       valley, impressed itself on my recollection. I never saw Sanquhar       again until in the autumn of 1863 (as I believe). As I was whirled       along the Glasgow and South-Western railway I witnessed just       beneath me lines of building in just such a valley, and said that       must be Sanquhar, which it was. My local memory has always been       good and very impressible by scenery. I seem to myself never to       have forgotten a scene.         I have one other early recollection to record. It must, I think,       have been in the year 1815 that my father and mother took me with       them on either one or two more journeys. The objective points were       Cambridge and London respectively. My father had built, under the       very niggard and discouraging laws which repressed rather than       encouraged the erection of new churches at that period, the church       of St."]]]
