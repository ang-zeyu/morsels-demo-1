On  the last day the house was decked, inside and out, with red and yellow  flowers; many valuable gifts were placed beside the corpse, and the  place was then abandoned.    [5] The Moro name for chief or ruler. The Bagobo name is _lagaimoda_ or  _matanem_, but the Moro term is in general use.    He was succeeded by his son Pangilan, whose administration, like that of  his father, was firm and just. Upon his death he bequeathed the  leadership of a united people to his son Manib. The new _datu_ did not  prove to be a great warrior and his decisions in matters of dispute were  not always just, so that bad blood arose between the people of Cibolan  and Talun. He was unable to quell the disturbances, and finally open  warfare broke out, petty chiefs of other districts throwing off his  control and ruling as _datu_. This was the condition which confronted  the present ruler, Tongkaling, when he found himself ruler of Cibolan.    The claims of leadership over all the Bagobo had never been  relinquished, but the actual power of the _datu_ outside his own  district amounted to little. Tongkaling soon established his right to  the name of a great warrior, and his people so prospered under his rule  that upon the advent of the Americans he was much the most powerful  among the several chiefs. Under the administration of Governor Bolton,  Tongkaling was officially recognized as head of the Bagobo, and with  this added prestige, he has finally succeeded in gaining recognition  from all the chiefs except those about Santa Cruz, but his actual  control over them is still very slight. He has been a consistent friend  of the Americans, but has jealously guarded his people against outside  influences, so that they are much less affected than those of other  districts. For this reason we shall, in this paper, use Cibolan as a  type settlement, but where radical differences occur in other districts  they will be noted.    PHYSICAL TYPE.[6]    [6] This subject will be treated fully in a separate publication.    An idea of the general appearance of the Bagobo can best be obtained by  a study of the accompanying photographs. Plates II-VIII.    Measurements were made on thirty-three men and fifteen women. The  maximum height of the males was found to be 164.8 cm.; minimum 149.8  cm.; with an average of 158.6 cm. For the women the maximum was 152.8  cm.; minimum 141 cm.; average 147.3 cm.    The cephalic indices of the same individuals showed 84.5 as the maximum,  74.3 minimum, and 78.8 the average for the males. The maximum for the  females was 83.1, minimum 76.2, average 80.7. The average length-height  index, taken from the tragus to the vertex, of the same persons, was  69.8--maximum 75.6, minimum 65.1 for the men; and for the women  73.1--maximum 76.6, minimum 70.2-.    The face is long, moderately broad, and the zygomatic arches are seldom  prominent. The forehead is high and full with supra-orbital ridge  slightly developed. The crown and back of the head are rather strongly  arched. The people are seldom prognathous, yet individuals are met with  who are markedly so (Plate V).    The lips are full and bowed; the chin is round and well formed. The root  of the nose is depressed; the ridge broad and generally inclined to be  concave, although straight noses are not uncommon. The nasal wings are  moderately broad and arched or swelled. The eye slits are oblique and  moderately open, showing dark or brown-black eyes. The hair is  brown-black and generally slightly wavy or loosely curled, while in some  cases it is found curled in locks. Women comb their hair straight back  and plaster it with cocoanut oil, but even this does not prevent stray  locks from creeping out. Both face and body hairs are scanty and are  generally removed, yet occasionally a man is seen who has cultivated a  few hairs into a fair semblance of a beard.    The Bagobo, while well nourished, are inclined to be of slight build,  with very narrow waists. In color they are a light reddish brown with a  slight olive tinge which is more pronounced in the women than in the  men.    In a brief summary, we can say that they are a short, slightly built,  metsati-cephalic people, with wavy hair, long faces, and broad, full  noses and lips. Individuals are met with who exhibit many of the  physical characteristics of the Negrito;[7] while still others, both in  color and facial lines, are comparable to the Chinese.    [7] Pygmy blacks of the Philippines.    DRESS--PERSONAL ADORNMENT.    No wild tribe in the Islands gives more attention to dress than does the  Bagobo. By an intricate process hemp is colored and woven into excellent  garments, which, in turn, are decorated with embroidery, applique, or  designs in shell disks and beads. The men wear their hair long and after  twisting it around the head hold it in place with kerchiefs, the edges  of which are decorated with beads and tassels.    A close fitting undershirt is often worn, and above this is an  elaborately beaded or embroidered coat which generally opens in front.  The hemp cloth trousers scarcely reach to the knee, and the bottom of  each leg is decorated with a beaded or embroidered band. Two belts are  worn, one to hold the trousers, the other to support the fighting or  working knives which each man carries. In lieu of pockets he has on his  back an elaborately beaded hemp cloth bag bordered with tassels and  bells of native casting. Highly prized shell bracelets, worn as cuffs by  some men, are made of a large, conical sea-shell (Fig. 1) the base and  interior spirals of which have been cut away. Necklaces made of rattan  strips decorated or overlaid with alternating layers of fern and orchid  cuticle (Fig. 2) are frequently seen, while many strands of beads and  carved seeds surround the necks of both men and women. Both sexes also  wear, above the calf of the leg, plaited or beaded leglets to some of  which magical properties are ascribed.    FIG. 1. SHELL BRACELET.    FIG. 2. NECKLACE OF RATTAN OVERLAID WITH FERN AND ORCHID CUTICLE.    The woman wears a jacket which is close fitting about the neck and  reaches to the skirt, so that no portion of the upper part of the body  is exposed. The cloth now used in this garment is generally secured in  trade, and in recent years decoration in applique has begun to succeed  the excellent embroidery seen on older garments. Frequently the two  types of decoration are seen on the same jacket, and to these are added  complicated designs in shell or metal disks, or beads. The narrow tube  skirt is of hemp cloth and is made like a sack with both ends open. At  the waist it is held in place by means of a cloth or beaded belt.    In addition to the many strands of beads which encircle the neck and  fall over the chest, a broad bead band is often worn over one shoulder,  passing under the opposite arm near the waist. Scarfs of colored cloth  are also worn in this manner when the ladies are on dress parade.  Leglets and brass anklets, made like tubes so as to enclose metal balls  (Fig. 3) or with bells and rattles attached, are commonly worn. The  women are fond of loading their arms with ornaments of shell or brass  (Fig. 4) and one forearm is covered with separate rings of incised brass  wire which increase in size from the centre towards the ends, forming an  ornament in the shape of an hour-glass. Their hair is generally cut so  as to leave a narrow band in front; this is brushed back, but often  falls forward on the face or in front of the ears. Back of this the hair  is kept well oiled and is combed straight to the back of the head, where  it is tied in a knot. Into this knot is pushed a wooden comb decorated  with incised lines filled with lime, or inlaid with beads. On festive  occasions more elaborate combs, with plumes or other decorations  attached, are worn. Aside from these ornaments the head is uncovered.    FIG. 3. BRASS ANKLETS WORN BY THE WOMEN.    FIG. 4. TYPES OF BRASS BRACELETS.    Men and women are seen who have their eyebrows shaved to thin lines.  This is a matter of individual taste and is done only for beauty.    Neither sex makes use of tattooing, nor do they mutilate the lips or  nose, but what they lack in these respects they make up for in ear  ornaments.    When a child is very young a small hole is pierced in the ear lobes, and  into this opening a piece of twisted banana or hemp leaf is placed.  (Fig. 5a). This leaf acts as a spring, continually enlarging the opening  until the ear plugs can be inserted. Another method, sometimes employed,  is to fill the opening with small round sticks (Fig. 5b), adding more  from time to time, until the desired result is obtained. The plugs worn  by the women are of wood, the fronts of which are inlaid with silver or  brass in artistic designs, and are connected by strands of beads passing  under the chin (Fig. 6). Large wooden ornaments are also worn by the  men, but more prized are large ivory ear plugs made like enormous collar  buttons (Plates II-IV). These are very rare, since the ivory for their  manufacture must be secured from Borneo, and by the time it has passed  through the hands of many traders it has assumed a value which limits  the possession of articles made from it to a few wealthy men. A further  method of ear adornment, frequently seen among the women, consists of  beads sewed into a number of holes which have been pierced through the  helices of the ears.    FIG. 5. EAR STRETCHERS.    FIG. 6. WOMAN'S EAR PLUGS.    Both men and women file and blacken the teeth. When a boy or girl has  reached the age of puberty, it is time that this beautifying should be  done. There is, however, no prohibition to having it performed earlier  if desired. The candidate places his head against the operator and grips  a stick of wood between his teeth while each tooth is filed so as to  leave only the stump, or is cut or broken to a point (Plate XIIa and b).

In the living plant, all these bodies are  combined with a large proportion of water, or are dissolved, or  suspended in that fluid. The relative quantity of water is much  greater in the stem and leaves than in the seed.    Everybody has seen a common fowl. It is an active creature which runs  about and sometimes flies. It has a body covered with feathers,  provided with two wings and two legs, and ending at one end in a neck  terminated by a head with a beak, between the two parts of which the  mouth is placed. The hen lays eggs, each of which is inclosed in a  hard shell. If you break an egg the contents flow out and are seen to  consist of the colorless glairy \"white\" and the yellow \"yolk.\" If the  white is collected by itself in water and then heated it becomes  turbid, forming a white solid, very similar to the vegetable albumin,  which is called animal albumin.    If the yolk is beaten up with water, no starch nor cellulose is  obtained from it, but there will be plenty of fatty and some  saccharine matter, besides substances more or less similar to albumin  and gluten.    The feathers of the fowl are chiefly composed of horn; if they are  stripped off and the body is boiled for a long time, the water will be  found to contain a quantity of gelatin, which sets into a jelly as it  cools; and the body will fall to pieces, the bones and the flesh  separating from one another. The bones consist almost entirely of a  substance which yields gelatin when it is boiled in water, impregnated  with a large quantity of salts of lime, just as the wood of the wheat  stem is impregnated with silica. The flesh, on the other hand, will  contain albumin, and some other substances which are very similar to  albumin, termed fibrin and syntonin.    In the living bird, all these bodies are united with a great quantity  of water, or dissolved, or suspended in water; and it must be  remembered that there are sundry other constituents of the fowl's body  and of the egg, which are left unmentioned, as of no present  importance.    The wheat plant contains neither horn, nor gelatin, and the fowl  contains neither starch, nor cellulose; but the albumin of the plant  is very similar to that of the animal, and the fibrin and syntonin of  the animal are bodies closely allied to both albumin and gluten.    That there is a close likeness between all these bodies is obvious  from the fact that when any of them is strongly heated, or allowed to  putrefy, it gives off the same sort of disagreeable smell; and careful  chemical analysis has shown that they are, in fact, all composed of  the elements carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, combined in very  nearly the same proportions. Indeed, charcoal, which is impure carbon,  might be obtained by strongly heating either a handful of corn, or a  piece of fowl's flesh, in a vessel from which the air is excluded so  as to keep the corn or the flesh from burning. And if the vessel were  a still, so that the products of this destructive distillation, as it  is called, could be condensed and collected, we should find water and  ammonia, in some shape or other, in the receiver. Now ammonia is a  compound of the elementary bodies, nitrogen and hydrogen; therefore  both nitrogen and hydrogen must have been contained in the bodies from  which it is derived.    It is certain, then, that very similar nitrogenous compounds form a  very large part of the bodies of both the wheat plant and the fowl,  and these bodies are called proteids.    It is a very remarkable fact that not only are such substances as  albumin, gluten, fibrin, and syntonin, known exclusively as products  of animal and vegetable bodies, but that every animal and every plant,  at all periods of its existence, contains one or other of them,  though, in other respects, the composition of living bodies may vary  indefinitely. Thus, some plants contain neither starch nor cellulose,  while these substances are found in some animals; while many animals  contain no horny matter and no gelatin-yielding substance. So that the  matter which appears to be the essential foundation of both the animal  and the plant is the proteid united with water; though it is probable  that, in all animals and plants, these are associated with more or  less fatty and amyloid (or starchy and saccharine) substances, and  with very small quantities of certain mineral bodies, of which the  most important appear to be phosphorus, iron, lime, and potash.    Thus there is a substance composed of water + proteids + fat +  amyloids + mineral matters which is found in all animals and plants;  and, when these are alive, this substance is termed protoplasm.    The wheat plant in the field is said to be a living thing; the fowl  running about the farmyard is also said to be a living thing. If the  plant is plucked up, and if the fowl is knocked on the head, they soon  die and become dead things. Both the fowl and the wheat plant, as we  have seen, are composed of the same elements as those which enter into  the composition of mineral matter, though united into compounds which  do not exist in the mineral world. Why, then, do we distinguish this  matter when it takes the shape of a wheat plant or a fowl, as living  matter?    In the spring a wheat-field is covered with small green plants. These  grow taller and taller until they attain many times the size which  they had when they first appeared; and they produce the heads of  flowers which eventually change into ears of corn.    In so far as this is a process of growth, accompanied by the  assumption of a definite form, it might be compared with the growth of  a crystal of salt in brine: but, on closer examination, it turns out  to be something very different. For the crystal of salt grows by  taking to itself the salt contained in the brine, which is added to  its exterior; whereas the plant grows by addition to its interior: and  there is not a trace of the characteristic compounds of the plant's  body, albumin, gluten, starch, or cellulose, or fat, in the soil, or  in the water, or in the air.    Yet the plant creates nothing; and, therefore, the matter of the  proteins and amyloids and fats which it contains must be supplied to  it, and simply manufactured, or combined in new fashions, in the body  of the plant.    It is easy to see, in a general way, what the raw materials are which  the plant works up, for the plant get nothing but the materials  supplied to it by the atmosphere and by the soil. The atmosphere  contains oxygen and nitrogen, a little carbonic acid gas, a minute  quantity of ammoniacal salts, and a variable proportion of water. The  soil contains clay and sand (silica), lime, iron, potash, phosphorus,  sulphur, ammoniacal salts, and other matters which are of no  importance. Thus, between them, the soil and the atmosphere contain  all the elementary bodies which we find in the plant; but the plant  has to separate them and join them together afresh.    Moreover, the new matter, by the addition of which the plant grows, is  not applied to its outer surface, but is manufactured in its interior;  and the new molecules are diffused among the old ones.    The grain of wheat is a part of the flower of the wheat plant, which,  when it becomes ripe, is easily separated. It contains a minute and  rudimentary plant; and, when it is sown, this gradually grows, or  becomes developed into, the perfect plant, with its stem, roots,  leaves, and flowers, which again give rise to similar seeds. No  mineral body runs through a regular series of changes of form and  size, and then gives off parts of its substance which take the same  course. Mineral bodies present no such development, and give off no  seeds or germs. They do not reproduce their kind.    The fowl in the farmyard is incessantly pecking about and swallowing  now a grain of corn, and now a fly or a worm. In fact, it is feeding,  and, as every one knows, would soon die if not supplied with food. It  is also a matter of every-day knowledge that it would not be of much  use to give a fowl the soil of a cornfield, with plenty of air and  water, to eat.    In this respect, the fowl is like all other animals; it cannot  manufacture the proteid materials of its body, but it has to take them  ready made, or in a condition which requires but very slight  modification by devouring the bodies either of other animals or of  plants. The animal or vegetable substances devoured are taken into the  animal's stomach; they are there digested or dissolved; and thus they  are fitted to be distributed to all parts of the fowl's own body, and  applied to its maintenance and growth.    The fowl's egg is formed in the body of the hen, and is, in fact, part  of her body inclosed in a shell and detached. It contains a minute  rudiment of a fowl; and when it is kept at a proper temperature by the  hen's sitting upon it, or otherwise for three weeks, this rudiment  grows, or develops, at the expense of the materials contained in the  yolk and the white, into a small bird, the chick, which is then  hatched and grows into a fowl. The animal, therefore, is produced by  the development of a germ in the same way as the plant; and, in this  respect, all plants and all animals agree with one another, and differ  from all mineral matter.    Thus there is a very broad distinction between mineral matter and  living matter. The elements of living matter are identical with those  of mineral bodies; and the fundamental laws of matter and motion apply  as much to living matter as to mineral matter; but every living body  is, as it were, a complicated piece of mechanism which \"goes,\" or  lives, only under certain conditions. The germ contained in the  fowl's egg requires nothing but a supply of warmth, within certain  narrow limits of temperature, to build the molecules of the egg into  the body of the chick. And the process of development of the"]]]
