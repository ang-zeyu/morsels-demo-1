Cacti  of various kinds vie with one another in producing the most brilliant  flowers, odorless but gorgeous. But in a few weeks all this brightness  fades and the country resumes the colorless monotonous aspect which  characterizes it.    July and August and sometimes part of September comprise the rainy  season. This period is marked by sudden heavy showers of short duration,  and the sandy soil absorbs sufficient moisture to nourish the grass and  herbage for a time; but most of the water finds its way directly into  deep-cut channels and thence in heavy torrents to the deep canyons of  the San Juan and the Colorado, where it is lost. A small portion of the  rainfall and much of the snow water percolates the soil and the porous  sandstones which compose the region, and issues in small springs along  the edges of the mesas and in the little canyons; but these last only  a few months, and they fail in the time of greatest need--in the hot  summer days when the grass is dry and brittle and the whole country is  parched.    The direct dependence of the savage on nature as he finds it is  nowhere better illustrated than on the Navaho reservation. In the three  essentials of land, water, and vegetation, his country is not an ideal  one. The hard conditions under which he lives have acted directly on his  arts and industries, on his habits and customs, and also on his mind and  his mythology. In one respect only has he an advantage: he is blessed  with a climate which acts in a measure as an offset to the other  conditions and enables him to lead a life which is on the whole not  onerous.    In these dry elevated regions the heat is never oppressive in the day  and the nights are always cool. Day temperatures of 120 deg. or more are  not uncommon in the valleys in July and August, but the humidity is so  slight that such high readings do not produce the discomfort the figures  might imply. In his calico shirt and breeches the Navaho is quite  comfortable, and in the cool of the evening and night he has but to add  a blanket, which he always has within reach. The range between the day  and night temperature in summer is often very great, but the houses are  constructed to meet these conditions; they are cool in hot weather and  warm in cold weather.    The extreme dryness of the air has another advantage from the Indian  point of view, in that it permits a certain degree of filthiness. This  seems inseparable from the Indian character, but it would be impossible  in a moist climate; even under the favorable conditions of the plateau  country many of the tribes are periodically decimated by smallpox.      HABITS OF THE PEOPLE    The habits of a people, which are to a certain extent the product of the  country in which they live, in turn have a pronounced effect on their  habitations. New Mexico and Arizona came into the possession of the  United States in 1846, and prior to that time the Navaho lived chiefly  by war and plunder. The Mexican settlers along the Rio Grande and the  Pueblo Indians of the same region were the principal contributors to  their welfare, and the thousands of sheep and horses which were stolen  from these people formed the nucleus or starting point of the large  flocks and herds which constitute the wealth of the Navaho today.    The Navajo reservation is better suited for the raising of sheep than  for anything else, and the step from the life of a warrior and hunter to  that of a shepherd is not a long one, nor a hard one to take. Under the  stress of necessity the Navajo became a peaceable pastoral tribe, living  by their flocks and herds, and practicing horticulture only in an  extremely limited and precarious way. Under modern conditions they  are slowly developing into an agricultural tribe, and this development  has already progressed far enough to materially affect their house  structures; but in a general way it may be said that they are a pastoral  people, and their habits have been dictated largely by that mode of  life.    Every family is possessed of a flock of sheep and goats, sometimes  numbering many thousands, and a band of horses, generally several  hundreds, in a few instances several thousands. In recent times many  possess small herds of cattle, the progeny of those which strayed into  the reservation from the numerous large herds in its vicinity, or were  picked up about the borders by some Navaho whose thrift was more highly  developed than his honesty. The condition of the tribe, as a whole, is  not only far removed from hardship, but may even be said to be one of  comparative affluence.    Owing to the scarcity of grass over most of the country, and the  difficulty of procuring a sufficient supply of water, the flocks must be  moved from place to place at quite frequent intervals. This condition  more than any other has worked against the erection of permanent houses.  Yet the Navaho are by no means nomads, and the region within which a  given family moves back and forth is extremely circumscribed.    In a general way the movements of a family are regulated by the  condition of the grass and the supply of water. In a dry season many  of the small springs cease to flow at an early date in the summer.  Moreover, if a flock is kept too long in one locality, the grass is  almost destroyed by close cropping, forcing the abandonment of that  particular place for two or three years. When this occurs, the place  will recover and the grass become good again if left entirely  undisturbed for several years.    The usual practice is to take the flocks up into the mountains or on  the high plateaus during the summer, quartering them near some spring or  small stream, and when the snow comes they are moved down to the lower  foothills or out into the valleys. In the winter both shepherds and  sheep depend on the snow for their water supply, and by this means an  immense tract of country, which otherwise would be a perfect waste,  is utilized. As the snow disappears from the valleys the flocks are  gradually driven back again into the mountains.    The heavy fall of snow in the mountains and its slow melting in spring  makes that region far more fertile and grassy than the valleys, and were  it possible to remain there throughout the year doubtless many families  would do so. As it is, however, the feed is covered too deeply for the  sheep to reach it, and during several months heavy snowdrifts make  communication very difficult and at times impossible. In a few favored  localities--usually small, well-sheltered valleys here and there in the  mountains--some families may remain throughout the winter, but as a  rule, at the first approach of the cold season and before the first snow  flies there is a general exodus to the low-lying valleys and the low  mesa regions, and the mountains are practically abandoned for a time.    During the rainy season pools and little lakes of water are formed all  over the flat country, lasting sometimes several weeks. Advantage is  taken of the opportunity thus afforded and the flocks are driven out on  the plains and grazed in the vicinity of the water so long as the supply  holds out, but as this is seldom prolonged more than a few weeks it is  not surprising that the house erected by the head of the family should  be of a very temporary nature. In fact the most finished house  structures of these people must be temporary rather than permanent so  long as the conditions sketched above prevail; in other words, so long  as they depend principally on their sheep.    Another result of these conditions is that each family lives by itself  and, as it were, on its own ground. Large communities are impossible,  and while there are instances where eight or ten families occupy some  place of exceptionally favorable location, these are rare. In fact to  see even three or four hogans together is remarkable. There are perhaps  more hogans in Canyon Chelly than in any other one locality, but the  people who live here are regarded by the other Navaho as poor, because  they own but few sheep and horses and depend principally on horticulture  for their subsistence. Incidentally it may be stated that horses are  well esteemed by the Navaho as an article of food, and that the large  herds which some of them own are not so wholly useless as they appear  to the casual traveler.    Canyon Chelly, which the Navaho call Tsegi, contains several small  streams and numerous patches of arable land on the bottoms. The  conditions here are exceptionally favorable for horticulture; indeed,  the numerous remains of cliff dwellings which are found in the canyon  would show this if other evidence were lacking. It has long been famous  among the Navaho as the horticultural center of the tribe, and for its  peach crops, derived from thousands of trees planted in sheltered nooks.  In the summer scattered members of the various families or clans gather  there by hundreds from every part of the reservation to feast together  for a week or two on green corn, melons, and peaches.    As a rule, however, each hogan stands by itself, and it is usually  hidden away so effectually that the traveler who is not familiar with  the customs of the people might journey for days and not see half a  dozen of them. The spot chosen for a dwelling place is either some  sheltered nook in a mesa or a southward slope on the edge of a pinon  grove near a good fuel supply and not too far from water. A house is  very seldom built close to a spring--perhaps a survival of the habit  which prevailed when the people were a hunting tribe and kept away from  the water holes in order not to disturb the game which frequented them.    So prevalent is this custom of placing the houses in out-of-the-way  places that the casual traveler receives the impression that the region  over which he has"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18214"],[0,"Our Friend the Dog (#3)"],[1,"and the weapons  wherewith to conquer us, I confess that I should distrust the hasty  vengeance of the horse, the obstinate reprisals of the ass and the  maddened meekness of the sheep. I should shun the cat as I should shun  the tiger; and even the good cow, solemn and somnolent, would inspire me  with but a wary confidence. As for the hen, with her round, quick eye,  as when discovering a slug or a worm, I am sure that she would devour me  without a thought.          III      Now, in this indifference and this total want of comprehension in which  everything that surrounds us lives; in this incommunicable world, where  everything has its object hermetically contained within itself, where  every destiny is self-circumscribed, where there exist among the  creatures no other relations than those of executioners and victims,  eaters and eaten, where nothing is able to leave its steel-bound  sphere, where death alone establishes cruel relations of cause and  effect between neighbouring lives, where not the smallest sympathy has  ever made a conscious leap from one species to another, one animal  alone, among all that breathes upon the earth, has succeeded in breaking  through the prophetic circle, in escaping from itself to come bounding  toward us, definitely to cross the enormous zone of darkness, ice and  silence that isolates each category of existence in nature's  unintelligible plan. This animal, our good familiar dog, simple and  unsurprising as may to-day appear to us what he has done, in thus  perceptibly drawing nearer to a world in which he was not born and for  which he was not destined, has nevertheless performed one of the most  unusual and improbable acts that we can find in the general history of  life. When was this recognition of man by beast, this extraordinary  passage from darkness to light, effected? Did we seek out the poodle,  the collie, or the mastiff from among the wolves and the jackals, or did  he come spontaneously to us? We cannot tell. So far as our human annals  stretch, he is at our side, as at present; but what are human annals in  comparison with the times of which we have no witness? The fact remains  that he is there in our houses, as ancient, as rightly placed, as  perfectly adapted to our habits as though he had appeared on this  earth, such as he now is, at the same time as ourselves. We have not to  gain his confidence or his friendship: he is born our friend; while his  eyes are still closed, already he believes in us: even before his birth,  he has given himself to man. But the word \"friend\" does not exactly  depict his affectionate worship. He loves us and reveres us as though we  had drawn him out of nothing. He is, before all, our creature full of  gratitude and more devoted than the apple of our eye. He is our intimate  and impassioned slave, whom nothing discourages, whom nothing repels,  whose ardent trust and love nothing can impair. He has solved, in an  admirable and touching manner, the terrifying problem which human wisdom  would have to solve if a divine race came to occupy our globe. He has  loyally, religiously, irrevocably recognized man's superiority and has  surrendered himself to him body and soul, without after-thought,  without any intention to go back, reserving of his independence, his  instinct and his character only the small part indispensable to the  continuation of the life prescribed by nature. With an unquestioning  certainty, an unconstraint and a simplicity that surprise us a little,  deeming us better and more powerful than all that exists, he betrays,  for our benefit, the whole of the animal kingdom to which he belongs  and, without scruple, denies his race, his kin, his mother and his  young.    [Illustration]    But he loves us not only in his consciousness and his intelligence: the  very instinct of his race, the entire unconsciousness of his species, it  appears, think only of us, dream only of being useful to us. To serve us  better, to adapt himself better to our different needs, he has adopted  every shape and been able infinitely to vary the faculties, the  aptitudes which he places at our disposal. Is he to aid us in the  pursuit of game in the plains? His legs lengthen inordinately, his  muzzle tapers, his lungs widen, he becomes swifter than the deer. Does  our prey hide under wood? The docile genius of the species, forestalling  our desires, presents us with the basset, a sort of almost footless  serpent, which steals into the closest thickets. Do we ask that he  should drive our flocks? The same compliant genius grants him the  requisite size, intelligence, energy and vigilance. Do we intend him to  watch and defend our house? His head becomes round and monstrous, in  order that his jaws may be more powerful, more formidable and more  tenacious. Are we taking him to the south? His hair grows shorter and  lighter, so that he may faithfully accompany us under the rays of a  hotter sun. Are we going up to the north? His feet grow larger, the  better to tread the snow; his fur thickens, in order that the cold may  not compel him to abandon us. Is he intended only for us to play with,  to amuse the leisure of our eyes, to adorn or enliven the home? He  clothes himself in a sovereign grace and elegance, he makes himself  smaller than a doll to sleep on our knees by the fireside, or even  consents, should our fancy demand it, to appear a little ridiculous to  please us.    You shall not find, in nature's immense crucible, a single living being  that has shown a like suppleness, a similar abundance of forms, the  same prodigious faculty of accommodation to our wishes. This is because,  in the world which we know, among the different and primitive geniuses  that preside over the evolution of the several species, there exists not  one, excepting that of the dog, that ever gave a thought to the presence  of man.    It will, perhaps, be said that we have been able to transform almost as  profoundly some of our domestic animals: our hens, our pigeons, our  ducks, our cats, our horses, our rabbits, for instance. Yes, perhaps;  although such transformations are not comparable with those undergone by  the dog and although the kind of service which these animals render us  remains, so to speak, invariable. In any case, whether this impression  be purely imaginary or correspond with a reality, it does not appear  that we feel in these transformations the same unfailing and preventing  good will, the same sagacious and exclusive love. For the rest, it is  quite possible that the dog, or rather the inaccessible genius of his  race, troubles scarcely at all about us and that we have merely known  how to make use of various aptitudes offered by the abundant chances of  life. It matters not: as we know nothing of the substance of things, we  must needs cling to appearances; and it is sweet to establish that, at  least in appearance, there is on the planet where, like unacknowledged  kings, we live in solitary state, a being that loves us.    However the case may stand with these appearances, it is none the less  certain that, in the aggregate of intelligent creatures that have  rights, duties, a mission and a destiny, the dog is a really privileged  animal. He occupies in this world a pre-eminent position enviable among  all. He is the only living being that has found and recognizes an  indubitable, tangible, unexceptionable and definite god. He knows to  what to devote the best part of himself. He knows to whom above him to  give himself. He has not to seek for a perfect, superior and infinite  power in the darkness, amid successive lies, hypotheses and dreams. That  power is there, before him, and he moves in its light. He knows the  supreme duties which we all do not know. He has a morality which  surpasses all that he is able to discover in himself and which he can  practise without scruple and without fear. He possesses truth in its  fulness. He has a certain and infinite ideal.          IV      And it was thus that, the other day, before his illness, I saw my little  Pelleas sitting at the foot of my writing-table, his tail carefully  folded under his paws, his head a little on one side, the better to  question me, at once attentive and tranquil, as a saint should be in the  presence of God. He was happy with the happiness which we, perhaps,  shall never know, since it sprang from the smile and the approval of a  life incomparably higher than his own. He was there, studying, drinking  in all my looks; and he replied to them gravely, as from equal to equal,  to inform me, no doubt, that, at least through the eyes the most  immaterial organ that transformed into affectionate intelligence the  light which we enjoyed, he knew that he was saying to me all that love  should say. And, when I saw him thus, young, ardent and believing,  bringing me, in some wise, from the depths of unwearied nature, quite  fresh news of life and trusting and wonderstruck, as though he had been  the first of his race that came to inaugurate the earth and as though we  were still in the first days of the world's existence, I envied the  gladness of his certainty, compared it with the destiny of man, still  plunging on every side into darkness, and said to myself that the dog  who meets with a good master is the happier of the two."]]]
