And presently that deceitful  level led to a higher bench upon which the pines towered, and were  matched by beautiful trees he took for spruce.  Heavily barked, with  regular spreading branches, these conifers rose in symmetrical shape to  spear the sky with silver plumes.  A graceful gray-green moss, waved  like veils from the branches.  The air was not so dry and it was  colder, with a scent and touch of snow.  Jean made camp at the first  likely site, taking the precaution to unroll his bed some little  distance from his fire.  Under the softly moaning pines he felt  comfortable, having lost the sense of an immeasurable open space  falling away from all around him.    The gobbling of wild turkeys awakened Jean, \"Chuga-lug, chug-a-lug,  chug-a-lug-chug.\"  There was not a great difference between the gobble  of a wild turkey and that of a tame one.  Jean got up, and taking his  rifle went out into the gray obscurity of dawn to try to locate the  turkeys.  But it was too dark, and finally when daylight came they  appeared to be gone.  The mule had strayed, and, what with finding it  and cooking breakfast and packing, Jean did not make a very early  start.  On this last lap of his long journey he had slowed down. He was  weary of hurrying; the change from weeks in the glaring sun and  dust-laden wind to this sweet coot darkly green and brown forest was  very welcome; he wanted to linger along the shaded trail.  This day he  made sure would see him reach the Rim.  By and by he lost the trail.  It had just worn out from lack of use.  Every now and then Jean would  cross an old trail, and as he penetrated deeper into the forest every  damp or dusty spot showed tracks of turkey, deer, and bear.  The amount  of bear sign surprised him.  Presently his keen nostrils were assailed  by a smell of sheep, and soon he rode into a broad sheep, trail.  From  the tracks Jean calculated that the sheep had passed there the day  before.    An unreasonable antipathy seemed born in him.  To be sure he had been  prepared to dislike sheep, and that was why he was unreasonable.  But  on the other hand this band of sheep had left a broad bare swath,  weedless, grassless, flowerless, in their wake.  Where sheep grazed  they destroyed.  That was what Jean had against them.    An hour later he rode to the crest of a long parklike slope, where new  green grass was sprouting and flowers peeped everywhere.  The pines  appeared far apart; gnarled oak trees showed rugged and gray against  the green wall of woods.  A white strip of snow gleamed like a moving  stream away down in the woods.    Jean heard the musical tinkle of bells and the baa-baa of sheep and the  faint, sweet bleating of lambs.  As he road toward these sounds a dog  ran out from an oak thicket and barked at him.  Next Jean smelled a  camp fire and soon he caught sight of a curling blue column of smoke,  and then a small peaked tent.  Beyond the clump of oaks Jean  encountered a Mexican lad carrying a carbine.  The boy had a swarthy,  pleasant face, and to Jean's greeting he replied, \"BUENAS DIAS.\"  Jean  understood little Spanish, and about all he gathered by his simple  queries was that the lad was not alone--and that it was \"lambing time.\"    This latter circumstance grew noisily manifest.  The forest seemed  shrilly full of incessant baas and plaintive bleats.  All about the  camp, on the slope, in the glades, and everywhere, were sheep.  A few  were grazing; many were lying down; most of them were ewes suckling  white fleecy little lambs that staggered on their feet.  Everywhere  Jean saw tiny lambs just born.  Their pin-pointed bleats pierced the  heavier baa-baa of their mothers.    Jean dismounted and led his horse down toward the camp, where he rather  expected to see another and older Mexican, from whom he might get  information.  The lad walked with him.  Down this way the plaintive  uproar made by the sheep was not so loud.    \"Hello there!\" called Jean, cheerfully, as he approached the tent. No  answer was forthcoming.  Dropping his bridle, he went on, rather  slowly, looking for some one to appear.  Then a voice from one side  startled him.    \"Mawnin', stranger.\"    A girl stepped out from beside a pine.  She carried a rifle.  Her face  flashed richly brown, but she was not Mexican.  This fact, and the  sudden conviction that she had been watching him, somewhat disconcerted  Jean.    \"Beg pardon--miss,\" he floundered.  \"Didn't expect, to see a--girl....  I'm sort of lost--lookin' for the Rim--an' thought I'd find a sheep  herder who'd show me.  I can't savvy this boy's lingo.\"    While he spoke it seemed to him an intentness of expression, a strain  relaxed from her face.  A faint suggestion of hostility likewise  disappeared.  Jean was not even sure that he had caught it, but there  had been something that now was gone.    \"Shore I'll be glad to show y'u,\" she said.    \"Thanks, miss.  Reckon I can breathe easy now,\" he replied,    \"It's a long ride from San Diego.  Hot an' dusty!  I'm pretty tired.  An' maybe this woods isn't good medicine to achin' eyes!\"    \"San Diego!  Y'u're from the coast?\"    \"Yes.\"    Jean had doffed his sombrero at sight of her and he still held it,  rather deferentially, perhaps.  It seemed to attract her attention.    \"Put on y'ur hat, stranger.... Shore I can't recollect when any man  bared his haid to me.\"  She uttered a little laugh in which surprise  and frankness mingled with a tint of bitterness.    Jean sat down with his back to a pine, and, laying the sombrero by his  side, he looked full at her, conscious of a singular eagerness, as if  he wanted to verify by close scrutiny a first hasty impression. If  there had been an instinct in his meeting with Colter, there was more  in this.  The girl half sat, half leaned against a log, with the shiny  little carbine across her knees.  She had a level, curious gaze upon  him, and Jean had never met one just like it.  Her eyes were rather a  wide oval in shape, clear and steady, with shadows of thought in their  amber-brown depths.  They seemed to look through Jean, and his gaze  dropped first.  Then it was he saw her ragged homespun skirt and a few  inches of brown, bare ankles, strong and round, and crude worn-out  moccasins that failed to hide the shapeliness, of her feet. Suddenly  she drew back her stockingless ankles and ill-shod little feet. When  Jean lifted his gaze again he found her face half averted and a stain  of red in the gold tan of her cheek.  That touch of embarrassment  somehow removed her from this strong, raw, wild woodland setting.  It  changed her poise.  It detracted from the curious, unabashed, almost  bold, look that he had encountered in her eyes.    \"Reckon you're from Texas,\" said Jean, presently.    \"Shore am,\" she drawled.  She had a lazy Southern voice, pleasant to  hear.  \"How'd y'u-all guess that?\"    \"Anybody can tell a Texan.  Where I came from there were a good many  pioneers an' ranchers from the old Lone Star state.  I've worked for  several.  An', come to think of it, I'd rather hear a Texas girl talk  than anybody.\"    \"Did y'u know many Texas girls?\" she inquired, turning again to face  him.    \"Reckon I did--quite a good many.\"    \"Did y'u go with them?\"    \"Go with them?  Reckon you mean keep company.  Why, yes, I guess I  did--a little,\" laughed Jean.  \"Sometimes on a Sunday or a dance once  in a blue moon, an' occasionally a ride.\"    \"Shore that accounts,\" said the girl, wistfully.    \"For what?\" asked Jean.    \"Y'ur bein' a gentleman,\" she replied, with force.  \"Oh, I've not  forgotten.  I had friends when we lived in Texas.... Three years ago.  Shore it seems longer.  Three miserable years in this damned country!\"    Then she bit her lip, evidently to keep back further unwitting  utterance to a total stranger.  And it was that biting of her lip that  drew Jean's attention to her mouth.  It held beauty of curve and  fullness and color that could not hide a certain sadness and  bitterness.  Then the whole flashing brown face changed for Jean. He  saw that it was young, full of passion and restraint, possessing a  power which grew on him.  This, with her shame and pathos and the fact  that she craved respect, gave a leap to Jean's interest.    \"Well, I reckon you flatter me,\" he said, hoping to put her at her ease  again.  \"I'm only a rough hunter an' fisherman-woodchopper an' horse  tracker.  Never had all the school I needed--nor near enough company of  nice girls like you.\"    \"Am I nice?\" she asked, quickly.    \"You sure are,\" he replied, smiling.    \"In these rags,\" she demanded, with a sudden flash of passion that  thrilled him.  \"Look at the holes.\"  She showed rips and worn-out  places in the sleeves of her buckskin blouse, through which gleamed a  round, brown arm.  \"I sew when I have anythin' to sew with.... Look at  my skirt--a dirty rag.  An' I have only one other to my name.... Look!\"  Again a color tinged her cheeks, most becoming, and giving the lie to  her action.  But shame could not check her violence now.  A dammed-up  resentment seemed to have broken out in flood.  She lifted the ragged  skirt almost to her knees.  \"No stockings!  No Shoes! ... How can a  girl be nice when she has no clean, decent woman's clothes to wear?\"    \"How--how can a girl...\" began Jean.  \"See here, miss, I'm beggin' your  pardon for--sort of stirrin' you to forget yourself a little. Reckon I  understand.  You don't meet many strangers an' I sort of hit you  wrong--makin' you feel too much--an' talk too much.  Who an' what you  are is none of my business.  But we met.... An' I reckon somethin' has  happened--perhaps more to me than to you.... Now let me put you  straight about clothes an' women.  Reckon I know most women love nice  things to wear an' think because clothes make them look pretty that  they're nicer or better.  But they're wrong.  You're wrong. Maybe it 'd  be too much for a girl like you to be happy without"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20709"],[0,"From Pole to Pole: A Book for Young People (#3)"],[1,"is called Berlin. For as a spider catches its prey  in an ingeniously spun net, so Berlin by its railways draws to itself  life and movement not only from Germany but from all Europe--nay, from  the whole world.    If we could fly some hundreds of miles straight up into the air and had  such sharp eyes that we could perceive all the coasts and boundaries of  Europe, and plainly distinguish the fine lines of the railways, we  should also see small, dark, short forms running backwards and forwards  along them. We should see, as it were, a teeming ant-hill, and after  every ant we should see a small puff of smoke. In Scandinavia and  Russia the bustle would seem less lively, but in the centre of Europe  the ants would scurry about with terrible activity.    Whether it was winter or summer, day or night, the bustle would never  grow less. From our elevated point of view we should see innumerable  trains flying in the night like glow-worms in every direction.  Ceaselessly they rush between cities and states, between the sea-coast  and the inland districts, and to and from the heart of Europe. For  during the last twenty years Berlin has become the heart of Europe.  London is situated on an island, and Paris is too near the margin of the  Continent. But in Berlin several of the greatest railway routes meet,  and whether the traveller goes from Paris to St. Petersburg, from  Stockholm to Rome, or from Hamburg to Vienna, he has always to pass  through Berlin.    In the city which is \"the heart of Europe\" we must expect to find the  main thoroughfares crowded with foot-passengers of all nationalities,  and vehicles of every conceivable kind--motor cars, electric trams,  horse omnibuses, vans, cabs, carts, and so on. Yet in spite of their  endless streams of traffic, the streets of Berlin are not noisy--not  nearly so noisy as those of Stockholm--for they are paved with asphalt  and wood, and most of the conveyances have rubber tyres on their wheels.  As in other large cities, the streets are relieved of a great deal of  traffic by trains which run right through the town and round its  suburbs, either up in the air on viaducts, or underground in tunnels  lighted by electricity. At the Frederick Street Station of the City  Railway, which lies in the centre of the town, a train arrives or  departs every other minute of the day and of a good part of the night as  well.    Not far off is a square--the \"King's Place\"--where a monument to  commemorate the victory of the Germans over the French, in 1871, lifts  its spire above the city, with three rows of cannon captured in France  in its recesses. Close at hand, too, are the shady walks in the  \"Tiergarten\" (Park), where all Berlin is wont to enjoy itself on  Sundays. When we turn eastwards, we have to pass through a great  colonnade, the Brandenburg Gate, with Doric pillars supporting the  four-horsed chariot of the goddess of victory in beaten copper. Here the  German army entered Berlin after the conquest of France and the founding  of the German Empire.    On the farther side of this gate stretches one of the most noted  streets in Europe. For if Berlin is the heart of Germany, so is the  street called \"Unter den Linden\" (Under the Lime-Trees) the centre and  heart of Berlin. There are, indeed, streets which are longer, for this  extends only two-thirds of a mile, but hardly any which are broader, for  it is 66 yards across. Between its alternate carriage-roads and  foot-walks four double rows of limes and chestnuts introduce a  refreshing breath of open country right into the bosom of the great town  of stone, with its straight streets and heavy, grey square houses. As we  wander along \"Unter den Linden\" we pass the foreign embassies and the  German government offices, and, farther on, the palace of the old Kaiser  Wilhelm, which is unoccupied and has been left exactly as it was in his  lifetime. He used to stand at a corner window on the ground floor, and  look out at his faithful people.    It is now just noon. Splendid carriages and motor cars sweep past, and  the crush of people on the pavements is great. We hear the inspiriting  music of a military band, and the Imperial Guard marches down the  street, followed by crowds of eager sightseers. Keeping time with the  music we march with them past the great Royal Library to where Frederick  the Great looks down from his tall bronze horse on the children of  to-day. On the one side is the Opera House, on the other is the  University, with its ten thousand students, and farther on the Arsenal,  with its large historical collections of engines of war. We cross over  the \"Schlossbruecke\" (Palace Bridge), which throws its arch over the  River Spree, and follow the parade into the \"Lustgarten\" (Pleasure  Garden). The band halts at the foot of the statue of Frederick William  III. and the people crowd round to listen, for now one piece is played  after another. Thus the good citizens of Berlin are entertained daily.    There are several noteworthy buildings round the Lustgarten, among them  many art museums and picture galleries, as well as the Cathedral and the  Royal Palace (Plate I.). It looks very grand, this palace, though it  does not stand, as it should, in the middle of a great open space, but  is hemmed in by the streets around it.    Perhaps it would interest you to hear about a ball at the Imperial Court  of Germany. At the stroke of nine our carriage drives in under the  archway of the Palace. The carpeted staircases are lined by  \"Beef-eaters,\" in old-fashioned uniforms, as motionless as if they were  cast in wax. They do not turn even their eyes as the guests pass, much  less their heads. Now we are up in the state rooms, and move slowly  over the brightly polished floor through a suite of brilliant apartments  glittering with electric light. Pictures of the kings of Prussia stand  out against the gilt leather tapestry. At last we reach the great  throne-room, which takes its name from the black eagles on the ceiling.    [Illustration: PLATE I. BERLIN.    On the right is the Royal Palace, on the left the Cathedral, with the  Lustgarten in front. In the foreground is the River Spree.]    What a varied scene awaits us here! Great ladies in costly dresses  adorned with precious stones of great value, diamonds flashing and  sparkling wherever we look, generals and admirals in full dress, high  officials, ambassadors from foreign lands, including those of China and  Japan. Here comes a great man to whom all bow; it is the Imperial  Chancellor.    Chamberlains now request the guests to range themselves along the walls  of the throne-room. A herald enters and strikes his silver staff against  the floor, calling out aloud \"His Majesty the Emperor!\" All is silent as  the grave. Followed by the Empress, the princes and princesses, William  II. passes through the room and greets his guests with a manly  handshake. He begins with the ladies and then passes on to the gentlemen  and speaks to every one. The Swedish Minister presents me, and the  Emperor begins immediately to ask about Asia. He speaks of Alexander's  great campaign through the whole of western Asia, and expresses his  astonishment that a man's name can live with undiminished renown through  two thousand years. He points to the eagles on the ceiling, and asks if  I do not see a resemblance to the Chinese dragon. He talks of Tibet and  the Dalai Lama, and of the great stillness in the heart of the desert.    Soon the orchestra strikes up and the guests begin to dance. The only  one who seems unconcerned is the Emperor himself. An expression of deep  seriousness lies like a mask on his powerful face. Is it not enough to  be the Emperor of the German federation, with its four kingdoms,  Prussia, Bavaria, Saxony, and Wuertemberg, its six grand duchies, its  many duchies and electorates, its imperial territory, Alsace-Lorraine,  and its three free towns, Hamburg, Luebeck, and Bremen? Does he not rule  over sixty-five million people, over 207 towns of more than 25,000  inhabitants, and seven of more than half a million, namely Berlin,  Hamburg, Munich, Dresden, Leipzig, Breslau, and Cologne? Has he not by  the force of his own will created a fleet so powerful as to arouse  uneasiness in England, the country which has the sole command of the  sea? And is he not the commander-in-chief of an army which, on a war  footing, is as large as the whole population of Scotland? All this  might well make him serious.      BERLIN TO CONSTANTINOPLE    The next stage of our journey is from Berlin to Vienna, the capital of  Austria. The express train carries us rapidly southward through  Brandenburg. To the west we have the Elbe, which flows into the North  Sea at Hamburg; while to the east streams the Oder, which enters the  Baltic Sea at Stettin. But we make closer acquaintance only with the  Elbe, first when we pass Dresden, the capital of Saxony, and again when  we have crossed the Austrian frontier into Bohemia, where in a beautiful  and densely-peopled valley clothed with trees the railway follows the  windings of the stream. When the guard calls out at a large and busy  station \"Prague,\" we are sorry that we have no time to stay a few days  and stroll through the streets and squares of one of the finest and  oldest towns of Europe. The engine's whistle sounds again and the train  carries us swiftly onwards to Vienna, the capital of the Emperor Francis  Joseph, who alone is more remarkable than all the sights of the city.    Vienna is a fine and wealthy city, the fourth in Europe, and, like  Berlin, is full of centres of human civilisation, science and art. Here  are found relics of ancient times beside the grand palaces of the  present day, the \"Ring\" is one of the finest streets in the world, and  the tower of St. Stephen's Church rises up to the sky above the two  million inhabitants of the town.
