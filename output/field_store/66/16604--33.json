On the other hand, who can estimate the value of the knowledge lost  beyond hope of recovery, or the checks to human progress experienced,  in the repeated wiping out, so to speak, of the higher races and the  civilizations they embodied? And who can say that similar disasters  may not come again and again to humanity?    Suppose a pestilence peculiarly fatal to the white race should fall  upon the world to-day, crippling, perhaps exterminating, the now  dominant civilized nations; how long would the material elements of  our science and art or general culture remain with power to enlighten  the barbarous tribes that would inherit the earth? Human progress has  more than once been set back for centuries by such natural or  unnatural causes, leaving the sites of once splendid civilizations to  be overrun with barbaric hordes knowing nothing of the better times  that went before.    Suppose, again, that, by one of those geologic changes so numerous in  the history of our unstable globe, the existing continents should sink  a thousand feet. Every center of modern civilization would be  submerged. The great social and political organizations of humanity  would be broken up, and in the wreck of nations that would ensue very  little of the glory and culture of the race could survive. The earth  is dotted with vestiges of lost and forgotten empires. Can we  reasonably assume, in the face of such facts, that the nations of  to-day are immortal?    The question is: Shall we continue to trust to chance, as all other  civilizations have, for the preservation of the conquests we have made  among the forces and secrets of nature; or shall we do something  positive for posterity, and leave the ages to come some certain and  abiding legacy of our treasures of art and learning?    It may be that human progress will go on and on to the end of time  without a break; that in the course of centuries mankind will surpass  us in civilization, knowledge and power, as much as we surpass the  earliest and rudest men we have yet found traces of: maybe infinitely  more.    In such a case, what would not the scholars of, say the year 5000  A.D., or any other future age, be willing to give for a comprehensive  picture of humanity as it exists to-day--for a reasonably complete  library of our literature, science, and art? We may safely assume  that nothing of the sort will be possible if matters are left to take  their natural course. By that time every structure, every machine,  every book, every work of art, now in use or stored away in our  libraries and galleries of art, will have disappeared, a prey to time,  the elements, or the more destructive violence of man.    On the other hand, it may be that, through repeated disasters of one  sort or another, mankind, three thousand years hence, will have lost  all the knowledge men ever possessed, and be slowly struggling upward  for the hundredth time from inherited barbarism. In such a case, what  enormous benefits might not accrue to man from a fortunate opening up  of the wealth of knowledge we possess!    In any supposable case between these extremes of progress or  degradation, a legacy of art and learning, such as we might easily set  apart for remote posterity, would certainly be acceptable, perhaps  extremely useful. Besides, it might be possible for us to set such a  worthy example to those who shall come after us that, come what might,  humanity would never be left absolutely void of the means of  instruction, nor any worthy human achievement be absolutely lost or  forgotten. The experience of these later years has demonstrated the  value of such legacies even when unintentional, unselected, and  wretchedly fragmentary. It has made clear also how a legacy  deliberately made may be indefinitely preserved.    Roughly outlined, the carrying out of such a truly philanthropic  enterprise would involve nothing more difficult than--    _First_. The construction of a practically indestructible treasure  chamber in some secure place; and    _Second_. The preparation of a library well calculated to withstand  the corroding tooth of time.    Two kinds of structures would meet the first demand--massive pyramids  of covered earth or of solid masonry, or chambers hewn from the heart  of some granitic hill. In low latitudes, where glacial action is not  to be feared, the pyramidal form might be preferable: in more northern  regions the rock-cut chamber would probably be at once cheaper and  more durable. In either case, an elevated site should be chosen as a  safeguard against submergence.    To secure the permanence of the records would be more difficult.  Ordinary books and papers would clearly be unsuitable for long  keeping; though for comparatively limited periods they might answer if  securely packed in airtight waterproof cases. Nothing liable to  spontaneous decay should be admitted. Stereotype plates of metal would  be even more open to objection than printed sheets. The noble metals  would be too costly, the baser would corrode; and with either the  value of the plates as metal would be a standing danger to the  deposit. The material basis of the library must be, as nearly as  possible, worthless for other uses (to insure them against the natural  greed of man), yet such as will hold the records sharply and  faithfully under all circumstances. The _terra cotta_ tablets of  ancient Assyria are instructive in this connection. Possibly plates of  artificial stone, or sheets of a _papier-mache_-like preparation of  asbestos, might be less bulky and equally durable.    Having determined this point, and dug from the solid rock a chamber  for the reception of our legacy, the next step would be the selection  of its contents. Obviously the books to be preserved should embrace  first of all lexicons and grammars of every known form of speech,  since it is impossible to tell which of the dialects of to-day will be  the parents of the dominant tongue of any distant future time; while  we may be practically certain that some one or more of the languages  of to-day will furnish a key to any language that men will ever use.  Next in order would come encyclopaedias, the most comprehensive and  complete that there might be room for. The sacred books of all nations  might come next; then the works of the great poets, historians and  novelists; after them, the best obtainable records of art, science,  the various industries, and so on, with specimens of the best and most  typical of our works of art, manufacture, and the like.    The spaces between the various articles should be filled in with some  insoluble and neutral substance, to prevent corrosion, or the  infiltration of water and consequent damage to the plates. Then, the  entrance to the chamber being securely sealed, permanent records  should be made in many places and in various ways, setting forth the  purpose of the deposit, its exact location, and the nature of its  contents. Among such records not the least valuable would be deeply  cut polyglot inscriptions on natural cliffs in different parts of the  world, observation having shown that such records may remain to  challenge human curiosity for ages after all other records of their  time have disappeared.    Even a single deposit of this sort might prove of enormous value to  the race at some critical period of its history. But the probability  is that the good work would not end with one deposit. From age to age  this and other nations might repeat the experiment, commemorating in  this way important epochs in their history. The fashion once set might  easily become a permanent feature of all great national celebrations.  The cost would be comparatively small: a penny contribution from each  of the visitors to the Philadelphia Exhibition, for example, would  have been quite sufficient to provide for a memorial of our first  Centennial year that would have carried an imperishable picture of the  civilization of the day to the end of--our first millennium, at least;  and we may safely infer that, whatever may be the condition of the  world at that not very remote epoch, a memorial of that sort would be  something worth having.    As we have intimated, the custom might easily become general, so that  in the course of ages the earth would become dotted with such  repositories of art and learning. Then, come what might to  humanity--whatever might be the ups and downs of nations--whatever  moral, social, or intellectual advances mankind might make--whatever  lapses or disasters might befall them--it could hardly happen that a  knowledge of any considerable period of human history, or the  advantage of any worthy human achievement, could ever be permanently  blotted out and lost.    It is true that \"posterity\" has never done anything of the sort for  us. It is true that \"posterity\" may have no valid claim on us for such  a legacy. But we might venture to make \"posterity\" a present! It would  not cost us much, and it might turn out to be immensely valuable and  useful to some far future age.           *       *       *       *       *          THE LOST ARTS IN NEW YORK.      While the objects of ancient art contained in the Castellani  collection, recently placed on exhibition in the Metropolitan Museum  of Art in this city, are individually of great rarity and  archaeological value, they derive additional importance from the fact  that, viewed conjunctively as a collection, they represent connected  histories of two great industrial arts extending over many centuries.  Both in the work of the goldsmith and of the potter, we are enabled to  trace progress from the earliest stages up to a period when the  greatest skill was attained, and even subsequently into the era of  decadence. In both industries, we find that ancient and mediaeval  workmen possessed knowledge which we do not possess; and among Signor  Castellani's treasures may be seen handiwork which is the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19415"],[0,"Libraries in the Medieval and Renaissance Periods (#3)"],[1,"door. Each is about ten feet wide by two feet deep.      _Book-recess, east walk of the cloister, Worcester._      A similar receptacle for books seems to have been contemplated in  Augustinian Houses, for in the Customs of the Augustinian Priory of  Barnwell, written towards the end of the thirteenth century, the following  passage occurs:        The press in which the books are kept ought to be lined inside      with wood, that the damp of the walls may not moisten or stain      the books. This press should be divided vertically as well as      horizontally by sundry partitions, on which the books may be      ranged so as to be separated from one another; for fear they      be packed so close as to injure each other, or delay those who      want them.    Recesses such as these were developed in Cistercian houses into a small  square room without a window, and but little larger than an ordinary  cupboard. In the plans of Clairvaux and Kirkstall this room is placed  between the chapter-house and the transept of the church; and similar  rooms, in similar situations, have been found at Fountains, Beaulieu,  Tintern, Netley, etc. The catalogue, made 1396, of the Cistercian Abbey at  Meaux in Holderness, now totally destroyed, gives us a glimpse of the  internal arrangement of one of these rooms. The books were placed on  shelves against the walls, and even over the door. Again, the catalogue of  the House of White Canons at Titchfield in Hampshire, dated 1400, shews  that the books were kept in a small room, on shelves there called  _columpnae_, set against the walls. It is obvious that no study could have  gone forward in such places as these; they must have been intended for  security only, and to replace the wooden presses used elsewhere.    As time went on, the number of the books would naturally increase, and by  the beginning of the fifteenth century the larger monasteries at least  had accumulated many hundred volumes. For instance, at Christ Church,  Canterbury, at the beginning of the 14th century, there were 698. These  had to be bestowed in various parts of the House without order or  selection,--in presses set up wherever a vacant corner could be found--to  the great inconvenience, we may be sure, of the more studious monks, or of  scholars who came to consult them. To remedy such a state of things a  definite room was constructed for books--in addition to the presses in the  cloister, which were still retained for the books in daily use. A few  instances of this will suffice. At Christ Church, Canterbury, a library  was built between 1414 and 1443 by Archbishop Chichele, over the Prior's  Chapel; at Durham between 1416 and 1446 by Prior Wessyngton, over the old  sacristy; at Citeaux in 1480, over the writing-room (_scriptorium_); at  Clairvaux between 1495 and 1503, in the same position; at S. Victor in  Paris--an Augustinian House--between 1501 and 1508; and at S. Germain des  Pres in the same city about 1513, over the south cloister.    Most of us, I take it, have more or less imperfect ideas of the appearance  of a great monastery in the days of its completeness; and information on  this point is unfortunately much more defective for our own country than  it is for France. In illustration, therefore, of what I have been saying  about the position of monastic libraries, I will next shew you two  bird's-eye views of the Benedictine House of S. Germain des Pres, Paris.  The first, dated 1687, shews the library over the south walk of the  cloister, where it was placed in 1513. It must not, however, be supposed  that no library existed before this. On the contrary, the House seems to  have had one from the first foundation, and so early as the thirteenth  century it could be consulted by strangers, and books borrowed from it.  The second view, dated 1723, shews a still further extension of the  library. It has now invaded the west side of the cloister, which has  received an upper storey, and even the external appearance of the  venerable refectory, which was respected when nearly all the rest of the  buildings were rebuilt in a classical style, has been sacrificed to a  similar gallery. The united lengths of these three rooms must have been  little short of 324 feet. This library was at the disposal of all scholars  who desired to use it. When the Revolution came it contained more than  49,000 printed books, and 7000 manuscripts. The fittings belonged to the  period of its latest extension: they appear to have been sumptuous, but  for my present object, uninteresting.      _Views of S. Germain des Pres:_ (1) _from Franklin, \"Anciennes  Bibliotheques de Paris,\"_ i. 126; (2) _from Bouillart, \"Histoire de  l'Abbaye de S. Germain des Prez.\"_      At Canterbury the library, built as I have said, over the Prior's Chapel,  was 60 feet long, by 22 feet broad; and we know, from some memoranda  written in 1508, when a number of books were sent to be bound or repaired,  that it contained sixteen bookcases, each of which had four shelves. I  have calculated that this library could have contained about 2000 volumes.    I have shewn you a Benedictine House, and will next shew you a bird's-eye  view of Citeaux, the parent house of the Cistercian Order, founded at the  close of the eleventh century. The original was taken, so far as I can  make out, about 1500, at any rate before the primitive buildings had been  seriously altered. The library here occupied two positions--under the roof  between the dormitory and the refectory (which must have been extremely  inconvenient); and subsequently it was rebuilt in an isolated situation on  the north side of the second cloister, over the writing-room  (_scriptorium_). This was also the position of the new library at  Clairvaux--the other great Cistercian House in France--the fame of which  was equal to, if not greater than, that of Citeaux. Of this latter library  we have two descriptions; the first written in 1517, the second in 1723.      _View of Citeaux: from Viollet-Le-Duc, \"Dictionnaire de l'Architecture,\"_  i. 271.      The former account, by the secretary of the Queen of Sicily, who visited  Clairvaux 13 July 1517, is as follows:        On the same side of the cloister are fourteen studies, where      the monks write and study, and over the said studies is the      new library, to which one mounts by a broad and lofty spiral      staircase from the aforesaid cloister. This library is 189      feet long, by 17 feet wide. In it are 48 seats (_bancs_), and      in each seat 4 shelves (_poulpitres_) furnished with books on      all subjects, but chiefly theology; the greater number of the      said books are of vellum, and written by hand, richly storied      and illuminated. The building that contains the said library      is magnificent, built of stone, and excellently lighted on      both sides with fine large windows, well glazed, looking out      on the said cloister and the burial-ground of the brethren....      The said library is paved throughout with small tiles adorned      with various designs.    The description written in 1723, by the learned Benedictines to whom we  owe the _Voyage Litteraire_, is equally interesting:        From the great cloister you proceed into the cloister of      conversation, so called because the brethren are allowed to      converse there. In this cloister there are 12 or 15 little      cells, all of a row, where the brethren formerly used to write      books; for this reason they are still called at the present      day the writing-rooms. Over these cells is the Library, the      building for which is large, vaulted, well lighted, and      stocked with a large number of manuscripts, fastened by chains      to desks; but there are not many printed books.    In the great cloister, on the side next the Chapter House, the same  observer noted \"books chained on wooden desks, which brethren can come and  read when they please.\" The library was for serious study, the cloister  for daily reading, probably in the main devotional.    If my time were unlimited I could describe to you several other fifteenth  century monastic libraries, but I feel that I must content myself with  only one more--that of the Franciscan House in London, commonly called  Christ's Hospital. The first stone of this library was laid by Sir Richard  Whittington, 21 October, 1421, and by Christmas Day in the following year  the roof was finished. Stow tells us that it was 129 feet long by 31 feet  broad; and the Letters Patent of Henry the Eighth add that it had 28  desks, and 28 double settles of wainscot. The whole building--so well  worth preservation--has been totally destroyed, but I am able to shew you  a view of it.      _Library of Christ's Hospital: from Trollope's \"History of Christ's  Hospital,\"_ p. 105.    This view is an excellent illustration of the point on which I have  insisted, namely, that in the course of the fifteenth century the great  religious Houses--no matter to what Order they belonged--found that their  books had become too numerous for the localities primitively intended for  them, and began to build special libraries--usually over some existing  structure; or--in other words--established a library of reference, which  was not unfrequently thrown open to scholars in general, who were allowed  to borrow books from it, on execution of an indenture, or deposit of a  sufficient pledge. \"It is safer to fall back on a pledge, than to proceed  against an individual,\" said the Customs of the Priory at Abingdon.    In what way were these monastic libraries fitted up? No trace of any  monastic fittings has survived, so far as I am aware, either in England,  or in France, or in Italy; and even M. Viollet-Le-Duc dismisses \"The  Library\" in a few brief sentences, of which the keynote is despair. My own  view is that a close analogy may be traced between the fittings of  monastic libraries and those of collegiate libraries; and that when we"]]]
