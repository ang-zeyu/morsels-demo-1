But a sergeant who had nine wounds and was  a brave fellow, begged not to be put to so much shame. And the blower  let him down easily, so that he came to no harm, and he bade him go to  the king and tell him that whatever regiments he liked to send more  should be blown away just the same. And the king, when he got the  message, said,    \"Let the fellows be; they have some right on their side.\" So the six  comrades carried home their treasure, divided it among them, and lived  contented till they died.          CLEVER GRETHEL      THERE was once a cook called Grethel, who wore shoes with red heels, and  when she went out in them she gave herself great airs, and thought  herself very fine indeed. When she came home again, she would take a  drink of wine to refresh herself, and as that gave her an appetite, she  would take some of the best of whatever she was cooking, until she had  had enough;--\"for,\" said she, \"a cook must know how things taste.\"    Now it happened that one day her master said to her,--    \"Grethel, I expect a guest this evening; you must make ready a pair of  fowls.\"    \"Certainly, sir, I will,\" answered Grethel. So she killed the fowls,  cleaned them, and plucked them, and put them on the spit, and then, as  evening drew near, placed them before the fire to roast. And they began  to be brown, and were nearly done, but the guest had not come.    \"If he does not make haste,\" cried Grethel to her master, \"I must take  them away from the fire; it's a pity and a shame not to eat them now,  just when they are done to a turn.\" And the master said he would run  himself and fetch the guest. As soon as he had turned his back, Grethel  took the fowls from before the fire.    \"Standing so long before the fire,\" said she, \"makes one hot and  thirsty,--and who knows when they will come! in the meanwhile I will go  to the cellar and have a drink.\" So down she ran, took up a mug, and  saying, \"Here's to me!\" took a good draught. \"One good drink deserves  another,\" she said \"and it should not be cut short;\" so she took another  hearty draught. Then she went and put the fowls down to the fire again,  and, basting them with butter, she turned the spit briskly round. And  now they began to smell so good that Grethel saying, \"I must find out  whether they really are all right,\" licked her fingers, and then cried,  \"Well, I never! the fowls are good; it's a sin and a shame that no one  is here to eat them!\"    So she ran to the window to see if her master and his guest were coming,  but as she could see nobody she went back to her fowls. \"Why, one of the  wings is burning!\" she cried presently, \"I had better eat it and get it  out of the way.\" So she cut it off and ate it up, and it tasted good,  and then she thought,    \"I had better cut off the other too, in case the master should miss  anything.\" And when both wings had been disposed of she went and looked  for the master, but still he did not come.    \"Who knows,\" said she, \"whether they are coming or not? they may have  put up at an inn.\" And after a pause she said again, \"Come, I may as  well make myself happy, and first I will make sure of a good drink and  then of a good meal, and when all is done I shall be easy; the gifts of  the gods are not to be despised.\" So first she ran down into the cellar  and had a famous drink, and ate up one of the fowls with great relish.  And when that was done, and still the master did not come, Grethel eyed  the other fowl, saying, \"What one is the other must be, the two belong  to each other, it is only fair that they should be both treated alike;  perhaps, when I have had another drink, I shall be able to manage it.\"  So she took another hearty drink, and then the second fowl went the way  of the first.    Just as she was in the middle of it the master came back. \"Make haste,  Grethel,\" cried he, \"the guest is coming directly!\" \"Very well, master,\"  she answered, \"it will soon be ready.\" The master went to see that the  table was properly laid, and, taking the great carving knife with which  he meant to carve the fowls, he sharpened it upon the step. Presently  came the guest, knocking very genteelly and softly at the front door.  Grethel ran and looked to see who it was, and when she caught sight of  the guest she put her finger on her lip saying, \"Hush! make the best  haste you can out of this, for if my master catches you, it will be bad  for you; he asked you to come to supper, but he really means to cut off  your ears! Just listen how he is sharpening his knife!\"    The guest, hearing the noise of the sharpening, made off as fast as he  could go. And Grethel ran screaming to her master. \"A pretty guest you  have asked to the house!\" cried she.    \"How so, Grethel? what do you mean?\" asked he.    \"What indeed!\" said she; \"why, he has gone and run away with my pair of  fowls that I had just dished up.\"    \"That's pretty sort of conduct!\" said the master, feeling very sorry  about the fowls; \"he might at least have left me one, that I might have  had something to eat.\" And he called out to him to stop, but the guest  made as if he did not hear him; then he ran after him, the knife still  in his hand, crying out, \"Only one! only one!\" meaning that the guest  should let him have one of the fowls and not take both, but the guest  thought he meant to have only one of his ears, and he ran so much the  faster that he might get home with both of them safe.          The DEATH of the HEN      ONCE on a time the cock and the hen went to the nut mountain, and they  agreed beforehand that whichever of them should find a nut was to divide  it with the other. Now the hen found a great big nut, but said nothing  about it, and was going to eat it all alone, but the kernel was such a  fat one that she could not swallow it down, and it stuck in her throat,  so that she was afraid she should choke.    \"Cock!\" cried she, \"run as fast as you can and fetch me some water, or I  shall choke!\"    So the cock ran as fast as he could to the brook, and said, \"Brook, give  me some water, the hen is up yonder choking with a big nut stuck in her  throat.\" But the brook answered, \"First run to the bride and ask her for  some red silk.\"    So the cock ran to the bride and said,    \"Bride, give me some red silk; the brook wants me to give him some red  silk; I want him to give me some water, for the hen lies yonder choking  with a big nut stuck in her throat.\"    But the bride answered,    \"First go and fetch me my garland that hangs on a willow.\" And the cock  ran to the willow and pulled the garland from the bough and brought it  to the bride, and the bride gave him red silk, and he brought it to the  brook, and the brook gave him water. So then the cock brought the water  to the hen, but alas, it was too late; the hen had choked in the  meanwhile, and lay there dead. And the cock was so grieved that he  cried aloud, and all the beasts came and lamented for the hen; and six  mice built a little waggon, on which to carry the poor hen to her grave,  and when it was ready they harnessed themselves to it, and the cock  drove. On the way they met the fox.    \"Halloa, cock,\" cried he, \"where are you off to?\"    \"To bury my hen,\" answered the cock.    \"Can I come too?\" said the fox.    \"Yes, if you follow behind,\" said the cock.    So the fox followed behind and he was soon joined by the wolf, the bear,  the stag, the lion, and all the beasts in the wood. And the procession  went on till they came to a brook.    \"How shall we get over?\" said the cock. Now in the brook there was a  straw, and he said,    \"I will lay myself across, so that you may pass over on me.\" But when  the six mice had got upon this bridge, the straw slipped and fell into  the water and they all tumbled in and were drowned. So they were as  badly off as ever, when a coal came up and said he would lay himself  across and they might pass over him; but no sooner had he touched the  water than he hissed, went out, and was dead. A stone seeing this was  touched with pity, and, wishing to help the cock, he laid himself across  the stream. And the cock drew the waggon with the dead hen in it safely  to the other side, and then began to draw the others who followed behind  across too, but it was too much for him, the waggon turned over, and all  tumbled into the water one on the top of another, and were drowned.    So the cock was left all alone with the dead hen, and he digged a grave  and laid her in it, and he raised a mound above her, and sat himself  down and lamented so sore that at last he died. And so they were all  dead together.          HANS IN LUCK      HANS had served his master seven years, and at the end of the seventh  year he said,    \"Master, my time is up; I want to go home and see my mother, so give me  my wages.\"    \"You have served me truly and faithfully,\" said the master; \"as the  service is, so must the wages be,\" and he gave him a lump of gold as big  as his head. Hans pulled his handkerchief out of his pocket and tied up  the lump of gold in it, hoisted it on his shoulder, and set off on his  way home. And as he was trudging along, there came in sight a man riding  on a spirited horse, and looking very gay and lively. \"Oh!\" cried Hans  aloud, \"how splendid riding must be! sitting as much at one's ease as in  an arm-chair, stumbling over no stones, saving one's shoes, and getting  on one hardly knows how!\"    The horseman heard Hans say this, and called out to him,    \"Well Hans, what are you doing on foot?\"    \"I can't help myself,\" said Hans, \"I have this great lump to carry; to  be sure, it is gold, but then I can't hold my head straight for it, and  it hurts my shoulder.\"    \"I'll tell you what,\" said the horseman, \"we will change; I will give  you my horse, and you shall give me your lump of gold.\"    \"With all my heart,\" said Hans; \"but I warn "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19090"],[0,"Star Hunter (#3)"],[1,"patron of the Starfall to its least important  employee and then grinned, thrusting his fanged jaws close to  Lansor's.    \"If the master wants to drink, you dirt-rat, you drink!\"    Vye nodded vigorously, and then put his hand to his mouth, afraid his  stomach was about to betray him again. Apprehensive, he watched the  Vorm-man turn away. Only when that broad, green-gray back was lost in  the smoky far reaches of the room did he expel his breath again.    \"Here--\" The grip was gone from his wrist, but fingers now put a mug  into his hand. \"Drink!\"    He tried to protest, knew it was hopeless, and used both hands to get  the mug to his lips, mouthing the stinging liquid in dull despair.  Only, instead of bringing nausea with it, the stuff settled his  stomach, cleared his head, with an after glow with which he managed  to relax from the tense state of endurance which filled his hours in  the Starfall.    Half of the mug's contents inside him and he dared to raise his eyes  to the man opposite him. Yes, this was no common crewman, nor was he  drunk as he had pretended for the Vorm-man. Now he watched the milling  crowd with a kind of detachment, though Vye was sure he was aware of  every move he himself made.    Vye finished the liquid. For the first time since he had come into  this place two months earlier he felt like a real person again. And he  had wits enough to guess that the potion he had just swallowed  contained some drug. Only now he did not care at all. Anything which  could wipe out in moments all the shame, fear, and sick despair the  Starfall had planted in him was worth swallowing. Why the other had  drugged him was a mystery, but he was content to wait for  enlightenment.    Lansor's companion once more applied that compelling pressure to the  younger man's bony forearm. Linked by that hold they left the  Starfall, came into the cooler, far more pleasant atmosphere of the  street. They were a block away before Vye's guide halted, though he  did not release his prisoner.    \"Forty names of Dugor!\" he spat.    Lansor waited, breathing in the air of early morning. The confidence  of the drug still held. At the moment he was certain nothing could be  as bad as the life behind him, he was willing to face what this  strange patron of the Starfall had in mind.    The other slapped his hand down on an air-car call button, stood  waiting until one of the city flitters landed on beam before them.    From the seat of the air-car Vye noted they were heading into the  respectability of the upper city, away from the stews ringing the  launch port. He tried to guess their destination or purpose, not that  either mattered much. Then the car descended on a landing stage.    The stranger waved Lansor through a doorway, down a short corridor  into a room of private quarters. Vye sat down gingerly on the foam  seat extending from the wall as he neared. He stared about. Dimly he  could just remember rooms which had this degree of comfort, but so  dimly now he could not be sure they did not exist only in his vivid  imagination. For Vye's imagination had buoyed him first through the  drab existence in a State Child's Creche, then through a state-found  job which he had lost because he could not adapt to the mechanical  life of a computer tender, and had been an anchor and an escape when  he had sunk through the depths of the port to the last refuge in the  Starfall.    Now he pressed both his hands into the soft stuff of the seat and  gaped at a small tri-dee on the wall facing him, a miniature scene of  life on some other planet wherein a creature enveloped in short black  and white striped fur crept belly flat, to stalk long-legged,  short-winged birds making blood-red splotches against yellow reed  banks under a pale violet sky. He feasted on its color, on the sense  of freedom and off-world wonders which it raised in him.    \"Who are you?\"    The stranger's abrupt question brought him back, not only to the room  but to his own precarious position. He moistened his lips, no longer  quite so aglow with confidence.    \"Vye--Vye Lansor.\" Then he added his other identification, \"S. C. C.  425061.\"    \"State child, eh?\" The other had pushed a button for a refresher cup,  then was sipping its contents slowly. He did not ring for a second to  offer Vye. \"Parents?\"    Lansor shook his head. \"I was brought in after the Five-Hour Fever  epidemic. They didn't try to keep records, there were too many of us.\"    The man was watching him levelly over the rim of that cup. There was  something cold in that study, something which curbed Vye's pleasant  feeling of only moments earlier. Now the other set down his drink,  crossed the room. Cupping his hand under Lansor's chin, he brought up  his head in a way which stirred a sullen resentment in the younger  man, yet something told him resistance would only bring trouble.    \"I'd say Terran stock--not more than second generation.\" He was  talking to himself more than to Vye. He loosed his hold on the boy's  chin, but he still stood there surveying him from head to foot. Lansor  wanted to squirm, but he fought that impulse, and managed to meet the  other's gaze when it reached his face again.    \"No--not the usual port-drift. I was right all the way.\" Now he  looked at Vye again as if the younger man did have a brain, emotions,  some call on his interest as a personality. \"Want a job?\"    Lansor pressed his hand deeper into the foam seat. \"What--what kind?\"  He was angry and ashamed at that small betraying break in his voice.    \"You have scruples?\" The stranger appeared to think that amusing. Vye  reddened, but he was also more than a little surprised that the man in  the worn space uniform had read hesitancy right. Someone out of the  Starfall should not be too particular about employment, and he could  not tell why he was.    \"Nothing illegal, I assure you.\" The man crossed to set his refresher  cup in the empty slot. \"I am an Out-Hunter.\"    Lansor blinked. This had all taken on some of the fantastic aura of a  dream. The other was eyeing him impatiently, as if he had expected  some reaction.    \"You may inspect my credentials if you wish.\"    \"I believe you,\" Vye found his voice.    \"I happen to need a gearman.\"    But this wasn't happening! Of course, it couldn't happen to him, Vye  Lansor, state child, swamper in the Starfall. Things such as this did  not happen, except in a thaline dream, and he wasn't a smoke eater! It  was the kind of dream a man didn't want to wake from, not if he was  port-drift.    \"Would you be willing to sign on?\"    Vye tried to clutch reality to himself, to remain level-headed. A  gearman for an Out-Hunter! Why five men out of six would pay a large  premium for a chance at such rating. The chill of doubt cut through  the first hazy rosiness. A swamper from a port-side dive simply did  not become a gearman for a Guild Hunter.    Again it was as if the stranger read his thoughts. \"Look here,\" he  spoke abruptly. \"I had a bad time myself, years ago. You resemble  someone to whom I owe a debt. I can't repay him, but I can make the  scales a little even this way.\"    \"Make the scales even.\" Vye's fading hope brightened. Then the  Out-Hunter was a follower of the Fata Rite. That would explain  everything. If you could not repay a good deed to the one you owed,  you must balance the Eternal Scales in another fashion. He relaxed  again, a great many of his unasked questions so answered.    \"You will accept?\"    Vye nodded eagerly. \"Yes, Out-Hunter.\" He still could not believe that  this was happening.    The other pressed the refresher button, and this time he handed Lansor  the brimming cup. \"Drink on the bargain.\" His words had the ring of  command.    Lansor drank, gulping down the contents of the cup, and suddenly was  aware of being tired. He leaned back against the wall, his eyes  closed.    Ras Hume took the cup from the lax fingers of the young man. So far,  very good. Chance appeared to be playing on his side of the board. It  had been chance which had steered him into the Starfall just three  nights ago when he had been in quest of his imposter. And Vye Lansor  was better than he dared hope to find. The boy had the right coloring,  he had been batted around enough to fall for the initial story, he was  malleable now. And after Wass' techs worked on him he would be Rynch  Brodie--heir to one-third of Kogan-Bors-Wazalitz!    \"Come!\" He touched Vye on the shoulder. The boy opened his eyes but  his gaze did not focus as he got slowly to his feet. Hume glanced at  his planet-time watch. It was still very early; the chance he must run  in getting Lansor out of this building was small if they went at once.  Guiding the younger man with a light hold above the elbow, he walked  him out back to the flitter landing stage. The air-car was waiting.  Hume's sense of being a gambler facing a run of good luck grew as he  shepherded the boy into the flitter, punched a cover destination and  took off.    On another street he transferred himself and his charge into a second  air-car, set the destination to within a block of the address Wass had  given him. Not much later he walked Vye into a small lobby with a  discreet list of names posted in its rack. No occupations attached to  those colored streamers Hume noted. This meant either that their  owners represented luxury trades, where a name signified the  profession or service, or that they were covers--perhaps both. Wass'  world fringed many different circles, intermingled with some quite  surprising professions dedicated to the comfort, pleasure or health of  the idle rich, off-world nobility, and the criminal elite.    Hume fingered the right call button, knowing that the thumb pattern  he had left on Wass' conference table would have already been relayed  as his symbol of admission here. A flicker of light winked below the  name, the wall to the right shimmered, and produced a doorway.  Steering Vye to it,"]]]
