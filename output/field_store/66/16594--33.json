And the proofs and evidences which we give are not based  on traditional but on rational arguments.    It has now been proved by rational arguments that the world of existence  is in the utmost need of an educator, and that its education must be  achieved by divine power. There is no doubt that this holy power is  revelation, and that the world must be educated through this power which  is above human power.          4: ABRAHAM      One of those Who possessed this power and was assisted by it was Abraham.  And the proof of it was that He was born in Mesopotamia, and of a family  who were ignorant of the Oneness of God. He opposed His own nation and  people, and even His own family, by rejecting all their gods. Alone and  without help He resisted a powerful tribe, a task which is neither simple  nor easy. It is as if in this day someone were to go to a Christian people  who are attached to the Bible, and deny Christ; or in the Papal Court--God  forbid!--if such a one were in the most powerful manner to blaspheme  against Christ and oppose the people.    These people believed not in one God but in many gods, to whom they  ascribed miracles; therefore, they all arose against Him, and no one  supported Him except Lot, His brother's son, and one or two other people  of no importance. At last, reduced to the utmost distress by the  opposition of His enemies, He was obliged to leave His native land. In  reality they banished Him in order that He might be crushed and destroyed,  and that no trace of Him might be left.    Abraham then came into the region of the Holy Land. His enemies considered  that His exile would lead to His destruction and ruin, as it seemed  impossible that a man banished from His native land, deprived of His  rights and oppressed on all sides--even though He were a king--could escape  extermination. But Abraham stood fast and showed forth extraordinary  firmness--and God made this exile to be to His eternal honor--until He  established the Unity of God in the midst of a polytheistic generation.  This exile became the cause of the progress of the descendants of Abraham,  and the Holy Land was given to them. As a result the teachings of Abraham  were spread abroad, a Jacob appeared among His posterity, and a Joseph who  became ruler in Egypt. In consequence of His exile a Moses and a being  like Christ were manifested from His posterity, and Hagar was found from  whom Ishmael was born, one of whose descendants was Muhammad. In  consequence of His exile the Bab appeared from His posterity,(5) and the  Prophets of Israel were numbered among the descendants of Abraham. And so  it will continue for ever and ever. Finally, in consequence of His exile  the whole of Europe and most of Asia came under the protecting shadow of  the God of Israel. See what a power it is that enabled a Man Who was a  fugitive from His country to found such a family, to establish such a  faith, and to promulgate such teachings. Can anyone say that all this  occurred accidentally? We must be just: was this Man an Educator or not?    Since the exile of Abraham from Ur to Aleppo in Syria produced this  result, we must consider what will be the effect of the exile of  Baha'u'llah in His several removes from Tihran to Ba_gh_dad, from thence  to Constantinople, to Rumelia and to the Holy Land.    See what a perfect Educator Abraham was!          5: MOSES      Moses was for a long time a shepherd in the wilderness. Regarded  outwardly, He was a Man brought up in a tyrannical household, and was  known among men as One Who had committed a murder and become a shepherd.  By the government and the people of Pharaoh He was much hated and  detested.    It was such a Man as this that freed a great nation from the chains of  captivity, made them contented, brought them out from Egypt, and led them  to the Holy Land.    This people from the depths of degradation were lifted up to the height of  glory. They were captive; they became free. They were the most ignorant of  peoples; they became the most wise. As the result of the institutions that  Moses gave them, they attained a position which entitled them to honor  among all nations, and their fame spread to all lands, to such a degree  indeed that among surrounding nations if one wished to praise a man one  said, \"Surely he is an Israelite.\" Moses established laws and ordinances;  these gave life to the people of Israel, and led them to the highest  possible degree of civilization at that period.    To such a development did they attain that the philosophers of Greece  would come and acquire knowledge from the learned men of Israel. Such an  one was Socrates, who visited Syria, and took from the children of Israel  the teachings of the Unity of God and of the immortality of the soul.  After his return to Greece, he promulgated these teachings. Later the  people of Greece rose in opposition to him, accused him of impiety,  arraigned him before the Areopagus, and condemned him to death by poison.    Now, how could a Man Who was a stammerer, Who had been brought up in the  house of Pharaoh, Who was known among men as a murderer, Who through fear  had for a long time remained in concealment, and Who had become a  shepherd, establish so great a Cause, when the wisest philosophers on  earth have not displayed one thousandth part of this influence? This is  indeed a prodigy.    A Man Who had a stammering tongue, Who could not even converse correctly,  succeeded in sustaining this great Cause! If He had not been assisted by  divine power, He would never have been able to carry out this great work.  These facts are undeniable. Materialist philosophers, Greek thinkers, the  great men of Rome became famous in the world, each one of them having  specialized in one branch of learning only. Thus Galen and Hippocrates  became celebrated in medicine, Aristotle in logic and reasoning, and Plato  in ethics and theology. How is it that a shepherd could acquire all of  this knowledge? It is beyond doubt that He must have been assisted by an  omnipotent power.    Consider also what trials and difficulties arise for people. To prevent an  act of cruelty, Moses struck down an Egyptian and afterward became known  among men as a murderer, more notably because the man He had killed was of  the ruling nation. Then He fled, and it was after that that He was raised  to the rank of a Prophet!    In spite of His evil repute, how wonderfully He was guided by a  supernatural power in establishing His great institutions and laws!          6: CHRIST      Afterward Christ came, saying, \"I am born of the Holy Spirit.\" Though it  is now easy for the Christians to believe this assertion, at that time it  was very difficult. According to the text of the Gospel the Pharisees  said, \"Is not this the son of Joseph of Nazareth Whom we know? How can He  say, therefore, I came down from heaven?\"(6)    Briefly, this Man, Who, apparently, and in the eyes of all, was lowly,  arose with such great power that He abolished a religion that had lasted  fifteen hundred years, at a time when the slightest deviation from it  exposed the offender to danger or to death. Moreover, in the days of  Christ the morals of the whole world and the condition of the Israelites  had become completely confused and corrupted, and Israel had fallen into a  state of the utmost degradation, misery and bondage. At one time they had  been taken captive by the Chaldeans and Persians; at another time they  were reduced to slavery to the Assyrians; then they became the subjects  and vassals of the Greeks; and finally they were ruled over and despised  by the Romans.    This young Man, Christ, by the help of a supernatural power, abrogated the  ancient Mosaic Law, reformed the general morals, and once again laid the  foundation of eternal glory for the Israelites. Moreover, He brought to  humanity the glad tidings of universal peace, and spread abroad teachings  which were not for Israel alone but were for the general happiness of the  whole human race.    Those who first strove to do away with Him were the Israelites, His own  kindred. To all outward appearances they overcame Him and brought Him into  direst distress. At last they crowned Him with the crown of thorns and  crucified Him. But Christ, while apparently in the deepest misery and  affliction, proclaimed, \"This Sun will be resplendent, this Light will  shine, My grace will surround the world, and all My enemies will be  brought low.\" And as He said, so it was; for all the kings of the earth  have not been able to withstand Him. Nay, all their standards have been  overthrown, while the banner of that Oppressed One has been raised to the  zenith.    But this is opposed to all the rules of human reason. Then it becomes  clear and evident that this Glorious Being was a true Educator of the  world of humanity, and that He was helped and confirmed by divine power.          7: MUHAMMAD      Now we come to Muhammad. Americans and Europeans have heard a number of  stories about the Prophet which they have thought to be true, although the  narrators were either ignorant or antagonistic: most of them were clergy;  others were ignorant Muslims who repeated unfounded traditions about  Muhammad which they ignorantly believed to be to His praise.    Thus some benighted Muslims made His polygamy the pivot of their praises  and held it to be a wonder, regarding it as a miracle; and European  historians, for the most part, rely on the tales of these ignorant people.    For example, a foolish man said to a clergyman that the true proof of  greatness is bravery and the shedding of blood, and that in one day on the  field of battle a follower of Muhammad had cut off the heads of one  hundred men! This misled the clergyman to infer that killing is considered  the way to prove one's faith to Muhammad, while this is merely imaginary.

O Lud you are going to be moral, and forget that you are  among Friends.    SURFACE. Egad, that's true--I'll keep that sentiment till I see Sir  Peter. However it is certainly a charity to rescue Maria from such a  Libertine who--if He is to be reclaim'd, can be so only by a Person of  your Ladyship's superior accomplishments and understanding.    VERJUICE. 'Twould be a Hazardous experiment.    SURFACE. But--Madam--let me caution you to place no more confidence in  our Friend Snake the Libeller--I have lately detected him in frequent  conference with old Rowland [Rowley] who was formerly my Father's  Steward and has never been a friend of mine.    LADY SNEERWELL. I'm not disappointed in Snake, I never suspected the  fellow to have virtue enough to be faithful even to his own Villany.         Enter MARIA    Maria my dear--how do you do--what's the matter?    MARIA. O here is that disagreeable lover of mine, Sir Benjamin Backbite,  has just call'd at my guardian's with his odious Uncle Crabtree--so I  slipt out and ran hither to avoid them.    LADY SNEERWELL. Is that all?    VERJUICE. Lady Sneerwell--I'll go and write the Letter I mention'd to  you.    SURFACE. If my Brother Charles had been of the Party, madam, perhaps you  would not have been so much alarmed.    LADY SNEERWELL. Nay now--you are severe for I dare swear the Truth  of the matter is Maria heard YOU were here--but my dear--what has Sir  Benjamin done that you should avoid him so----    MARIA. Oh He has done nothing--but his conversation is a perpetual Libel  on all his Acquaintance.    SURFACE. Aye and the worst of it is there is no advantage in not knowing  Them, for He'll abuse a stranger just as soon as his best Friend--and  Crabtree is as bad.    LADY SNEERWELL. Nay but we should make allowance[--]Sir Benjamin is a  wit and a poet.    MARIA. For my Part--I own madam--wit loses its respect with me, when I  see it in company with malice.--What do you think, Mr. Surface?    SURFACE. Certainly, Madam, to smile at the jest which plants a Thorn on  another's Breast is to become a principal in the mischief.    LADY SNEERWELL. Pshaw--there's no possibility of being witty without a  little [ill] nature--the malice of a good thing is the Barb that makes  it stick.--What's your opinion, Mr. Surface?    SURFACE. Certainly madam--that conversation where the Spirit of Raillery  is suppressed will ever appear tedious and insipid--    MARIA. Well I'll not debate how far Scandal may be allowable--but in a  man I am sure it is always contemtable.--We have Pride, envy, Rivalship,  and a Thousand motives to depreciate each other--but the male-slanderer  must have the cowardice of a woman before He can traduce one.    LADY SNEERWELL. I wish my Cousin Verjuice hadn't left us--she should  embrace you.    SURFACE. Ah! she's an old maid and is privileged of course.         Enter SERVANT    Madam Mrs. Candour is below and if your Ladyship's at leisure will leave  her carriage.    LADY SNEERWELL. Beg her to walk in. Now, Maria[,] however here is a  Character to your Taste, for tho' Mrs. Candour is a little talkative  everybody allows her to be the best-natured and best sort of woman.    MARIA. Yes with a very gross affectation of good Nature and  Benevolence--she does more mischief than the Direct malice of old  Crabtree.    SURFACE. Efaith 'tis very true Lady Sneerwell--Whenever I hear the  current running again the characters of my Friends, I never think them  in such Danger as when Candour undertakes their Defence.    LADY SNEERWELL. Hush here she is----         Enter MRS. CANDOUR    MRS. CANDOUR. My dear Lady Sneerwell how have you been this Century.  I have never seen you tho' I have heard of you very often.--Mr.  Surface--the World says scandalous things of you--but indeed it is  no matter what the world says, for I think one hears nothing else but  scandal.    SURFACE. Just so, indeed, Ma'am.    MRS. CANDOUR. Ah Maria Child--what[!] is the whole affair off between  you and Charles? His extravagance; I presume--The Town talks of nothing  else----    MARIA. I am very sorry, Ma'am, the Town has so little to do.    MRS. CANDOUR. True, true, Child; but there's no stopping people's  Tongues. I own I was hurt to hear it--as I indeed was to learn from the  same quarter that your guardian, Sir Peter[,] and Lady Teazle have not  agreed lately so well as could be wish'd.    MARIA. 'Tis strangely impertinent for people to busy themselves so.    MRS. CANDOUR. Very true, Child; but what's to be done? People will  talk--there's no preventing it.--why it was but yesterday I was told  that Miss Gadabout had eloped with Sir Filagree Flirt. But, Lord! there  is no minding what one hears; tho' to be sure I had this from very good  authority.    MARIA. Such reports are highly scandalous.    MRS. CANDOUR. So they are Child--shameful! shameful! but the world is  so censorious no character escapes. Lord, now! who would have suspected  your friend, Miss Prim, of an indiscretion Yet such is the ill-nature  of people, that they say her unkle stopped her last week just as she was  stepping into a Postchaise with her Dancing-master.    MARIA. I'll answer for't there are no grounds for the Report.    MRS. CANDOUR. Oh, no foundation in the world I dare swear[;] no more  probably than for the story circulated last month, of Mrs. Festino's  affair with Colonel Cassino--tho' to be sure that matter was never  rightly clear'd up.    SURFACE. The license of invention some people take is monstrous indeed.    MARIA. 'Tis so but in my opinion, those who report such things are  equally culpable.    MRS. CANDOUR. To be sure they are[;] Tale Bearers are as bad as the Tale  makers--'tis an old observation and a very true one--but what's to be  done as I said before--how will you prevent People from talking--to-day,  Mrs. Clackitt assured me, Mr. and Mrs. Honeymoon were at last become  mere man and wife--like [the rest of their] acquaintance--she likewise  hinted that a certain widow in the next street had got rid of her Dropsy  and recovered her shape in a most surprising manner--at the same [time]  Miss Tattle, who was by affirm'd, that Lord Boffalo had discover'd his  Lady at a house of no extraordinary Fame--and that Sir Harry Bouquet and  Tom Saunter were to measure swords on a similar Provocation. But--Lord!  do you think I would report these Things--No, no[!] Tale Bearers as I  said before are just as bad as the talemakers.    SURFACE. Ah! Mrs. Candour, if everybody had your Forbearance and good  nature--    MRS. CANDOUR. I confess Mr. Surface I cannot bear to hear People  traduced behind their Backs[;] and when ugly circumstances come out  against our acquaintances I own I always love to think the best--by the  bye I hope 'tis not true that your Brother is absolutely ruin'd--    SURFACE. I am afraid his circumstances are very bad indeed, Ma'am--    MRS. CANDOUR. Ah! I heard so--but you must tell him to keep up his  Spirits--everybody almost is in the same way--Lord Spindle, Sir Thomas  Splint, Captain Quinze, and Mr. Nickit--all up, I hear, within this  week; so, if Charles is undone, He'll find half his Acquaintance ruin'd  too, and that, you know, is a consolation--    SURFACE. Doubtless, Ma'am--a very great one.         Enter SERVANT    SERVANT. Mr. Crabtree and Sir Benjamin Backbite.    LADY SNEERWELL. Soh! Maria, you see your lover pursues you--Positively  you shan't escape.         Enter CRABTREE and SIR BENJAMIN BACKBITE    CRABTREE. Lady Sneerwell, I kiss your hand. Mrs. Candour I don't believe  you are acquainted with my Nephew Sir Benjamin Backbite--Egad, Ma'am, He  has a pretty wit--and is a pretty Poet too isn't He Lady Sneerwell?    SIR BENJAMIN. O fie, Uncle!    CRABTREE. Nay egad it's true--I back him at a Rebus or a Charade against  the best Rhymer in the Kingdom--has your Ladyship heard the Epigram he  wrote last week on Lady Frizzle's Feather catching Fire--Do Benjamin  repeat it--or the Charade you made last Night extempore at Mrs.  Drowzie's conversazione--Come now your first is the Name of a Fish, your  second a great naval commander--and    SIR BENJAMIN. Dear Uncle--now--prithee----    CRABTREE. Efaith, Ma'am--'twould surprise you to hear how ready he is at  all these Things.    LADY SNEERWELL. I wonder Sir Benjamin you never publish anything.    SIR BENJAMIN. To say truth, Ma'am, 'tis very vulgar to Print and as my  little Productions are mostly Satires and Lampoons I find they  circulate more by giving copies in confidence to the Friends of the  Parties--however I have some love-Elegies, which, when favoured with  this lady's smile I mean to give to the Public.    [Pointing to MARIA.]    CRABTREE. 'Fore Heaven, ma'am, they'll immortalize you--you'll be handed  down to Posterity, like Petrarch's Laura, or Waller's Sacharissa.    SIR BENJAMIN. Yes Madam I think you will like them--when you shall see  in a beautiful Quarto Page how a neat rivulet of Text shall meander  thro' a meadow of margin--'fore Gad, they will be the most elegant  Things of their kind--    CRABTREE. But Ladies, have you heard the news?    MRS. CANDOUR. What, Sir, do you mean the Report of----    CRABTREE. No ma'am that's not it.--Miss Nicely is going to be married to  her own Footman.    MRS. CANDOUR. Impossible!    CRABTREE. Ask Sir Benjamin.    SIR BENJAMIN. 'Tis very true, Ma'am--everything is fixed and the wedding  Livery bespoke.    CRABTREE. Yes and they say there were pressing reasons for't.    MRS. CANDOUR. It cannot be--and I wonder any one should believe such a  story of so prudent a Lady as Miss Nicely.    SIR BENJAMIN. O Lud! ma'am, that's the very reason 'twas believed at  once. She has always been so cautious and so reserved, that everybody  was sure there was some reason for it at bottom.    LADY SNEERWELL. Yes a Tale of Scandal is as fatal to the Reputation of  a prudent Lady of her stamp as a Fever is generally to those of the  strongest"]]]
