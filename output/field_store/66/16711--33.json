[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2099"],[0,"A History of the Moravian Church (#3)"],[1," Bohemian people were furious. John Hus fanned the flame. \"We  Bohemians,\" he declared in a fiery sermon, \"are more wretched than dogs  or snakes. A dog defends the couch on which he lies. If another dog  tries to drive him off, he fights him. A snake does the same. But us the  Germans oppress. They seize the offices of state, and we are dumb. In  France the French are foremost. In Germany the Germans are foremost.  What use would a Bohemian bishop or priest, who did not know the German  language, be in Germany? He would be as useful as a dumb dog, who cannot  bark, to a flock of sheep. Of exactly the same use are German priests  to us. It is against the law of God! I pronounce it illegal.\" At last a  regulation was made by King Wenceslaus that the Bohemians should be more  fairly represented at Prague University. They had now three votes out  of four. John Hus was credited by the people with bringing about the  change. He became more popular than ever.    If Hus had only halted here, it is probable that he would have been  allowed to die in peace in his bed in a good old age, and his name would  be found enrolled to-day in the long list of Catholic saints. However  wicked the clergy may have been, they could hardly call a man a heretic  for telling them plainly about the blots in their lives. But Hus soon  stepped outside these narrow bounds. The more closely he studied the  works of Wycliffe, the more convinced he became that, on the whole,  the great English Reformer was right; and before long, in the boldest  possible way, he began to preach Wycliffe's doctrines in his sermons,  and to publish them in his books. He knew precisely what he was doing.  He knew that Wycliffe's doctrines had been condemned by the English  Church Council at Black-Friars. He knew that these very same doctrines  had been condemned at a meeting of the Prague University Masters. He  knew that no fewer than two hundred volumes of Wycliffe's works had been  publicly burned at Prague, in the courtyard of the Archbishop's Palace.  He knew, in a word, that Wycliffe was regarded as a heretic; and yet he  deliberately defended Wycliffe's teaching. It is this that justifies us  in calling him a Protestant, and this that caused the Catholics to call  him a heretic.    John Hus, moreover, knew what the end would be. If he stood to his guns  they would burn him, and burned he longed to be. The Archbishop forbade  him to preach in the Bethlehem Chapel. John Hus, defiant, went on  preaching. At one service he actually read to the people a letter he had  received from Richard Wyche, one of Wycliffe's followers. As the years  rolled on he became more \"heterodox\" than ever. At this period there  were still two rival Popes, and the great question arose in Bohemia  which Pope the clergy there were to recognise. John Hus refused to  recognise either. At last one of the rival Popes, the immoral John  XXIII., sent a number of preachers to Prague on a very remarkable  errand. He wanted money to raise an army to go to war with the King of  Naples; the King of Naples had supported the other Pope, Gregory XII.,  and now Pope John sent his preachers to Prague to sell indulgences at  popular prices. They entered the city preceded by drummers, and posted  themselves in the market place. They had a curious message to deliver.  If the good people, said they, would buy these indulgences, they would  be doing two good things: they would obtain the full forgiveness of  their sins, and support the one lawful Pope in his holy campaign. John  Hus was hot with anger. What vulgar traffic in holy things was this? He  believed neither in Pope John nor in his indulgences.    \"Let who will,\" he thundered, \"proclaim the contrary; let the Pope, or a  Bishop, or a Priest say, 'I forgive thee thy sins; I free thee from the  pains of Hell.' It is all vain, and helps thee nothing. God alone, I  repeat, can forgive sins through Christ.\"    The excitement in Prague was furious. From this moment onwards Hus  became the leader of a national religious movement. The preachers went  on selling indulgences {1409.}. At one and the same time, in three  different churches, three young artisans sang out: \"Priest, thou liest!  The indulgences are a fraud.\" For this crime the three young men were  beheaded in a corner near Green Street. Fond women--sentimental, as  usual--dipped their handkerchiefs in the blood of the martyrs, and a  noble lady spread fine linen over their corpses. The University students  picked up the gauntlet. They seized the bodies of the three young men,  and carried them to be buried in the Bethlehem Chapel. At the head of  the procession was Hus himself, and Hus conducted the funeral. The whole  city was in an uproar.    As the life of Hus was now in danger, and his presence in the city  might lead to riots, he retired for a while from Prague to the castle of  Kradonec, in the country; and there, besides preaching to vast crowds  in the fields, he wrote the two books which did the most to bring him to  the stake. The first was his treatise \"On Traffic in Holy Things\";  the second his great, elaborate work, \"The Church.\"[1] In the first he  denounced the sale of indulgences, and declared that even the Pope  himself could be guilty of the sin of simony. In the second, following  Wycliffe's lead, he criticised the whole orthodox conception of the day  of the \"Holy Catholic Church.\" What was, asked Hus, the true Church of  Christ? According to the popular ideas of the day, the true Church of  Christ was a visible body of men on this earth. Its head was the Pope;  its officers were the cardinals, the bishops, the priests, and other  ecclesiastics; and its members were those who had been baptized and  who kept true to the orthodox faith. The idea of Hus was different. His  conception of the nature of the true Church was very similar to that  held by many Non-conformists of to-day. He was a great believer in  predestination. All men, he said, from Adam onwards, were divided into  two classes: first, those predestined by God to eternal bliss; second,  those fore-doomed to eternal damnation. The true Church of Christ  consisted of those predestined to eternal bliss, and no one but God  Himself knew to which class any man belonged. From this position a  remarkable consequence followed. For anything the Pope knew to the  contrary, he might belong himself to the number of the damned. He could  not, therefore, be the true Head of the Church; he could not be the  Vicar of Christ; and the only Head of the Church was Christ Himself. The  same argument applied to Cardinals, Bishops and Priests. For anything he  knew to the contrary, any Cardinal, Bishop or Priest in the Church  might belong to the number of the damned; he might be a servant, not  of Christ, but of Anti-Christ; and, therefore, said Hus, it was utterly  absurd to look to men of such doubtful character as infallible spiritual  guides. What right, asked Hus, had the Pope to claim the \"power of  the keys?\" What right had the Pope to say who might be admitted to  the Church? He had no right, as Pope, at all. Some of the Popes were  heretics; some of the clergy were villains, foredoomed to torment in  Hell; and, therefore, all in search of the truth must turn, not to the  Pope and the clergy, but to the Bible and the law of Christ. God alone  had the power of the keys; God alone must be obeyed; and the Holy  Catholic Church consisted, not of the Pope, the Cardinals, the Priests,  and so many baptized members, but \"of all those that had been chosen  by God.\" It is hard to imagine a doctrine more Protestant than this.  It struck at the root of the whole Papal conception. It undermined the  authority of the Catholic Church, and no one could say to what, ere  long, it might lead. It was time, said many, to take decisive action.    For this purpose Sigismund, King of the Romans and of Hungary, persuaded  Pope John XXIII. to summon a general Church Council at Constance; and at  the same time he invited Hus to attend the Council in person, and there  expound his views. John Hus set out for Constance. As soon as he arrived  in the city, he received from Sigismund that famous letter of \"safe  conduct\" on which whole volumes have been written. The King's promise  was as clear as day. He promised Hus, in the plainest terms, three  things: first, that he should come unharmed to the city; second, that he  should have a free hearing; and third, that if he did not submit to  the decision of the Council he should be allowed to go home. Of those  promises only the first was ever fulfilled. John Hus soon found himself  caught in a trap. He was imprisoned by order of the Pope. He was placed  in a dungeon on an island in the Rhine, and lay next to a sewer; and  Sigismund either would not or could not lift a finger to help him. For  three and a-half mouths he lay in his dungeon; and then he was removed  to the draughty tower of a castle on Lake Geneva. His opinions were  examined and condemned by the Council; and at last, when he was called  to appear in person, he found that he had been condemned as a heretic  already. As soon as he opened his month to speak he was interrupted; and  when he closed it they roared, \"He has admitted his guilt.\" He had  one chance of life, and one chance only. He must recant his heretical  Wycliffite opinions, especially those set forth in his treatise on the  \"Church.\" What need, said the Council, could there be of any further  trial? The man was a heretic. His own books convicted him, and justice  must be done.    And now, on the last day of the trial, John Hus stood before the great  Council. The scene was appalling. For some weeks this gallant son of the  morning had been tormented by neuralgia. The marks of suffering were on  his brow. His face was pale; his cheeks were sunken; his limbs were weak  and trembling. But his eye flashed with a holy fire, and his words rang  clear and true.

He greatly assisted his sister in raising the  buildings of her monastery, contributing considerably to the cost; but  the plans and arrangements are thought to have been designed by Wilfrid,  who is known to have spent much time at Ely. It was he who gave his  benediction when Etheldreda was formally instituted as abbess, and who  admitted the earliest members of the house. As was not unusual, the  society included monks as well as nuns. In later times the Benedictine  rule was adopted. In the very year of the foundation, possibly on  account of its royal foundress and the support of the king, her brother,  the special privilege of exemption from interference, either by king or  bishop, was assigned to it in a national assembly. This at least seems  to be the meaning of the decree, as given in \"Liber Eliensis,\" that with  respect to the Isle of Ely, now dedicated to God's service, \"Non de Rege  nec de Episcopo libertas loci diminueretur, vel in posterum  confringeretur.\"    To endow and provide for her monastery, the foundress assigned her  entire principality of the isle. In this way the temporal power, which  was afterwards so peculiar a feature in the privileges of the bishops,  was acquired. In about five years Wilfrid went to Rome to obtain the  Papal confirmation of the grants and liberties of the new foundation;  but Etheldreda did not live to see his return. She died of some  contagious disease, June 23, 679, in the seventh year after she had  become abbess. She was buried, by her own directions, not in the church,  but in the nuns' graveyard. She was certainly not fifty years of age at  the time of her death. As will be seen hereafter, her body was removed  into the church in the time of her successor.    No description is extant of the buildings of the monastery first  erected. We know that the present cathedral is on the same site. Nor has  any record been preserved of any discoveries that may have been made in  later times, when extensive operations must have necessitated the laying  bare of some of the original foundations. From what is known of some  contemporary monasteries, we may conclude that the church at least was  of stone. Not a fragment of it is known to be in existence at the  present day. Whatever may have been its extent, it was wholly destroyed  by the Danes in 870. For four years the Danes had been ravaging the  eastern part of the country, burning monasteries and slaying their  inmates. In the immediate district, Crowland and Thorney, Medeshamstede  (Peterborough), and Ramsey had already felt the severity of their  attack; crumbling walls alone remained where their destructive violence  had been experienced. On their first attack on Ely they were repulsed.  The advantages of the situation among the fens had already suggested the  formation of something very similar to the famous Camp of Refuge in the  eleventh century; and the force thus collected was sufficient to drive  the Danes to their ships. But before long they returned with greater  numbers, headed by one of their kings, most likely Hubba, and altogether  overcame the resistance of the people of the isle. The conquerors then  marched \"directly to the Monastery of _S. Etheldreda_, at _Ely_, broke  their way into it, and put all the Religious to the sword, as well the  Nuns as the Monks, and others belonging to it, without any respect to  age, sex, or condition; and after they had stript the Monastery of every  thing that was valuable, and plundered the town, they set fire to the  Church and all the buildings and houses; and went away loaded with the  spoils, not only of the Town and Monastery of Ely, but likewise the  chief effects and riches of the country round about, which the  inhabitants of those parts had brought with them, as to a place of  security.\"[6]    The destruction of Ely monastery in 870 and its resuscitation by King  Edgar in 970 are an almost exact repetition of what took place at  Peterborough. But there is a difference in the history of the interval.  In the case of Peterborough, as far as is known, the ruin was complete,  and not the smallest attempt was made for a hundred years either to  restore the buildings or to revive the society. But at Ely, though the  destruction was hardly less complete, we read that within a few years  eight of the inmates of the monastery who had escaped when the place was  burnt came back, and to a certain extent continued the establishment.  They effected a partial restoration of a small portion of the church,  and performed divine service. It is said that King Alfred, who succeeded  in expelling the Danes, acquiesced in these clerks thus taking  possession of the place, although the former King of Mercia, finding the  monasteries deserted, had annexed all their property. It does not appear  certain whether these clerks were actual monks of the old monastery or  clergy of the place; but the new society thus inaugurated was like a  college of secular clergy. They were so far recognised as a settled  establishment that new endowments were acquired from various  benefactors.    The latter part of the tenth century was a time of great activity in  founding monasteries and in restoring those that had fallen into decay.  Edgar, the king, Dunstan, Archbishop of Canterbury, and Ethelwold,  Bishop of Winchester, were all enthusiastic in the work. The advancement  of the monastic system was the great object they all had at heart.  Application was made to the king by two nobles about his Court, both  foreigners, for a grant of the Isle of Ely, lately the possession of the  monastery. It does not appear what services either had rendered to  warrant the application. The sheriff of the county, however, interfered  to prevent any such grant being made. He represented to the king the  true state of affairs--in what way the Isle of Ely had become the  property of the monastery, how all had been lost after the Danish  invasion, and in what a lamentable condition the place was at the time,  although the remains of the sainted abbesses were still on the spot. The  king immediately saw here a new opportunity of furthering his religious  work. Committing the details to Bishop Ethelwold, he authorised him to  repair the church, provide fresh monks (but no nuns), make arrangements  for divine service, and supply new buildings for the new inmates. At the  same time the king undertook to provide lands and revenues for the  support of the monastery. When the bishop had discharged his commission  he obtained from the king a new grant of the whole of the Isle of Ely  for the restored monastery.    The charter of King Edgar is printed in the appendix to Bentham's  \"History and Antiquities.\" The king describes himself as \"Basileus  dilecte insule Albionis,\" and as desirous of shewing his gratitude for  the peace secured after conquering the Scots, Cambrians, and Britons by  restoring decayed monasteries and establishing them under the  Benedictine rule; and in particular he desires to honour the monastery  in the region of Ely (_Elig_), anciently dedicated to S. Peter, rendered  famous by the relics and miracles of the renowned virgin Etheldreda,  \"who, with body uncorrupted, lasts even to this day in a white marble  mausoleum.\" He appoints Brithnoth first abbot, and assigns certain  lands and revenues, including ten thousand eels due to him as king, for  the maintenance of the monastery. To signify the public character of the  grant, it is stated in the attestation clause that it is made not in a  corner, but in the open: \"Non clam in angulo sed sub divo palam  evidentissime.\" The charter is signed by the king, two archbishops,  twelve bishops, the queen, eleven abbots, nine dukes (_duces_), and  forty-one knights. This was in the year 970.    As has been said, the old establishment had given place to a company of  secular clergy. These were dispossessed by Bishop Ethelwold, unless any  chose to attach themselves to the new foundation upon the constitution  of the Benedictine house. But during the century that had elapsed since  the Danes evicted the monks, these clergy must have been careful  custodians of the church and buildings, most likely restoring by degrees  and erecting fresh accommodation as their means permitted, for there is  no account of any considerable rebuilding by Bishop Ethelwold. Repairs  and enlargement and decorations were necessary; but the bishop probably  found everything nearly ready to his hands, and he was not required to  undertake anything so extensive as had to be done under similar  circumstances at Peterborough. Everything was duly prepared for the new  monastery by the Feast of the Purification, 970; and on that day the  church and buildings, some partly restored and some newly erected, were  consecrated by Archbishop Dunstan.    During the time of Elsin, the second abbot (981-1016), some considerable  improvements were effected by Leofwin (of whom more will be told in a  later chapter) in the church. He rebuilt and enlarged the south aisle,  joining it to the rest of the building. In one of its porches, or  side-chapels (_in uno porticu_), he built an altar to the Virgin Mary,  erecting over it a stately image of gold and silver, adorned with  valuable jewels. It is probable that this chapel, and the one that  possibly replaced it when the present cathedral was built, may have been  colloquially known as the lady-chapel, for it is sometimes said that a  lady-chapel was in existence before the fourteenth century; but there  was nothing about it of the dignity and importance usually associated  with the name.    Although the Isle of Ely plays so important a part in the history of the  Norman Conquest, and was the scene of the last great stand made against  the Conqueror, neither the party of Hereward and the Camp of Refuge, nor  the forces of the king, did any material damage to the buildings of the"]]]
