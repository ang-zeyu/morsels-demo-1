Marcia's first impulse was to catch up the little fellow and his gift  in her arms, and baptize them with a flood of tears from her own  overcharged heart! But she hadn't taught boys in a Mission Sunday  school class for nothing--Joe would have thought she had gone crazy,  or been struck silly, or was sick unto death; so she controlled  herself, and kneeling beside him took the violets reverently in both  her hands, saying in a choked voice: \"Joe, they are just beautiful!  This is the only really truly white gift I have had today, and I don't  deserve it--but I thank Him and you.\"    The boy looked at her with shining face, drew his hand across his  eyes, and then answered brightly: \"Oh, that's all right, Miss Marshay;  'tenny rate 'tis with me, 'n' I reckon 'tis with Him\"--and seizing his  crutch, he hopped like a little sparrow through the door and onto the  street, and she heard his boyish voice calling out: \"Evenin' papers,  last edishun--all 'bout the big graft 'sposure.\"    Just then the big white touring car discharged its merry load at the  door, and the house was filled with the chatter and laughter of the  children. In vain she tried to find a quiet corner where she could be  alone with her heart--it was impossible to escape from the hilarious  celebration of her birthday. She was so glad when the children said  good-night and went off to bed, and she could seek the quiet of her  own room.    As she bade her father good night, he said: \"Well, daughter, I hope  you have enjoyed your birthday and all your gifts?\"    At this all the honesty of her nature, all the hatred of sham, rose up  in one indignant outburst, and she exclaimed: \"I have had no gifts,  neither has this been my birthday celebration.\"    \"Why, Marcia!\" said her father in an aggrieved tone, \"this certainly  is your birthday, and we have been very happy in keeping it for love  of you.\"    \"I have failed to see any manifestation of love to me,\" retorted  Marcia. \"You may have had a happy time, but I have not been in it; you  have given gifts to one another, but I have had just one\"--and she  held up the bunch of violets. \"This is a gift of love from little lame  Joe, in answer to his prayer, and in pity for my hungry heart.\"    There was silence in the room for a moment, and then her father  answered: \"It seems to me, daughter, that when you get right down to a  personal application, what you believe in after all is a 'white  birthday'.\"    The words went through her like an electric shock, and with a start  she awoke, and sat upright in her chair; and, lo, it was all a dream!    Marcia looked around the room, shook herself a little, stirred the  fire, and put on fresh coal. She laughed at the remembrance of her  dream, and its absurdity! How glad she was that it was only a dream!  But was it only a dream? Was it not a reality? Was not this the way  she had kept the Lord's birthday? When she had opened her Christmas  treasure, how much had been given Him and for love of Him? How large a  place had she given Him in the season's activity? Had she ever made  room for Him as the central figure of it all; or had he been crowded  out, and His rightful place given to Santa Claus and the world's  merry-making?    In the light of the Spirit she saw that the Star of Bethlehem always  leads to the cross of Calvary. She had never liked to think about the  cross before, but now it was all illumined with the glory of the love  which gave to us God's best, his only begotten Son. She remembered how  the Lord Jesus had said: \"If I be lifted up, I will draw all men unto  Me.\" She saw that it is as we see Christ on the cross for us that we  are drawn to Him.    In that still hour, on her knees, at the foot of the cross, Marcia  with great gladness made her first \"White Gift\" unto her Lord--she  gave HERSELF to Him.

Stickney      Far away in the forest, where the warm sun and the fresh air made a  sweet resting place, grew a pretty little fir tree. The situation was  all that could be desired; and yet it was not happy, it wished so  much to be like its tall companions, the pines and firs which grew  around it.    The sun shone, and the soft air fluttered its leaves, and the little  peasant children passed by, prattling merrily; but the fir tree did  not heed them.    Sometimes the children would bring a large basket of raspberries or  strawberries, wreathed in straws, and seat themselves near the fir  tree, and say, \"Is it not a pretty little tree?\" which made it feel  even more unhappy than before.    And yet all this while the tree grew a notch or joint taller every  year; for by the number of joints in the stem of a fir tree we can  discover its age.    Still, as it grew, it complained: \"Oh! how I wish I were as tall as  the other trees; then I would spread out my branches on every side,  and my crown would overlook the wide world around. I should have the  birds building their nests on my boughs, and when the wind blew, I  should bow with stately dignity, like my tall companions.\"    So discontented was the tree, that it took no pleasure in the warm  sunshine, the birds, or the rosy clouds that floated over it morning  and evening.    Sometimes in winter, when the snow lay white and glittering on the  ground, there was a little hare that would come springing along,  and jump right over the little tree's head; then how mortified it  would feel.    Two winters passed; and when the third arrived, the tree had grown so  tall that the hare was obliged to run round it. Yet it remained  unsatisfied, and would exclaim, \"Oh! to grow, to grow; if I could but  keep on growing tall and old! There is nothing else worth caring for  in the world.\"    In the autumn the woodcutters came, as usual, and cut down several of  the tallest trees; and the young fir, which was now grown to its full  height, shuddered as the noble trees fell to the earth with a crash.    After the branches were lopped off, the trunks looked so slender and  bare that they could scarcely be recognized. Then they were placed,  one upon another, upon wagons, and drawn by horses out of the forest.  \"Where could they be going? What would become of them?\" The young fir  tree wished very much to know.    So in the spring, when the swallows and the storks came, it asked, \"Do  you know where those trees were taken? Did you meet them?\"    The swallows knew nothing; but the stork, after a little reflection,  nodded his head, and said, \"Yes, I think I do. As I flew from Egypt, I  saw several new ships, and they had fine masts that smelt like fir.  These must have been the trees; and I assure you they were stately;  they sailed right gloriously!\"    \"Oh, how I wish I were tall enough to go on the sea,\" said the fir  tree. \"Tell me what is this sea, and what does it look like?\"    \"It would take too much time to explain, a great deal too much,\" said  the stork, flying quickly away.    \"Rejoice in thy youth,\" said the sunbeam; \"rejoice in thy fresh  growth, and in the young life that is in thee.\"    And the wind kissed the tree, and the dew watered it with tears; but  the fir tree regarded them not.    Christmas time drew near, and many young trees were cut down, some  that were even smaller and younger than the fir tree, who enjoyed  neither rest nor peace with longing to leave its forest home. These  young trees, which were chosen for their beauty, kept their branches,  and were also laid on wagons, and drawn by horses far away out of the  forest.    \"Where are they going?\" asked the fir tree. \"They are not taller than  I am; indeed, one is not so tall. And why do they keep all their  branches? Where are they going?\"    \"We know, we know,\" sang the sparrows; \"we have looked in at the  windows of the houses in the town, and we know what is done with them.  Oh! you cannot think what honor and glory they receive. They are  dressed up in the most splendid manner. We have seen them standing in  the middle of a warm room, and adorned with all sorts of beautiful  things;--honey cakes, gilded apples, playthings, and many hundreds of  wax tapers.\"    \"And then,\" asked the fir tree, trembling in all its branches, \"and  then what happens?\"    \"We did not see any more,\" said the sparrows; \"but this was enough  for us.\"    \"I wonder whether anything so brilliant will ever happen to me,\"  thought the fir tree. \"It would be better even than crossing the sea.  I long for it almost with pain. Oh, when will Christmas be here? I am  now as tall and well grown as those which were taken away last year.  Oh, that I were now laid on the wagon, or standing in the warm room,  with all that brightness and splendor around me! Something better and  more beautiful is to come after, or the trees would not be so decked  out. Yes, what follows will be grander and more splendid. What can it  be? I am weary with longing. I scarcely know what it is that I feel.\"    \"Rejoice in our love,\" said the air and the sunlight. \"Enjoy thine own  bright life in the fresh air.\"    But the tree would not rejoice, though it grew taller every day and,  winter and summer, its dark green foliage might be seen in the  forests, while passersby would say, \"What a beautiful tree!\"    A short time before Christmas the discontented fir tree was the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17774"],[0,"The Poetry of Architecture (#3)"],[1," I. Sec. 16.]    13. Let us now cross the Channel, and endeavor to find a country cottage  on the other side, if we can; for it is a difficult matter. There are  many villages; but such a thing as an isolated cottage is extremely  rare. Let us try one or two of the green valleys among the chalk  eminences which sweep from Abbeville to Rouen. Here is a cottage at  last, and a picturesque one, which is more than we could say for the  English domicile. What then is the difference? There is a general air of  _nonchalance_ about the French peasant's habitation, which is aided by a  perfect want of everything like neatness; and rendered more conspicuous  by some points about the building which have a look of neglected beauty,  and obliterated ornament. Half of the whitewash is worn off, and the  other half colored by various mosses and wandering lichens, which have  been permitted to vegetate upon it, and which, though beautiful,  constitute a kind of beauty from which the ideas of age and decay are  inseparable. The tall roof of the garret window stands fantastically  out; and underneath it, where, in England, we had a plain double  lattice, is a deep recess, flatly arched at the top, built of solid  masses of gray stone, fluted on the edge; while the brightness of the  glass within (if there be any) is lost in shade, causing the recess to  appear to the observer like a dark eye. The door has the same character:  it is also of stone, which is so much broken and disguised as to prevent  it from giving any idea of strength or stability. The entrance is always  open; no roses, or anything else, are wreathed about it; several  outhouses, built in the same style, give the building extent; and the  group (in all probability, the dependency of some large old chateau in  the distance) does not peep out of copse, or thicket, or a group of tall  and beautiful trees, but stands comfortlessly between two individuals  of the columns of long-trunked facsimile elms, which keep guard along  the length of the public road.    14. Now, let it be observed how perfectly, how singularly, the  distinctive characters of these two cottages agree with those of the  countries in which they are built; and of the people for whose use they  are constructed. England is a country whose every scene is in  miniature.[2] Its green valleys are not wide; its dewy hills are not  high; its forests are of no extent, or, rather, it has nothing that can  pretend to a more sounding title than that of \"wood.\" Its champaigns are  minutely checkered into fields; we can never see far at a time; and  there is a sense of something inexpressible, except by the truly English  word \"snug,\" in every quiet nook and sheltered lane. The English  cottage, therefore, is equally small, equally sheltered, equally  invisible at a distance.    [Footnote 2: Compare with this chapter, _Modern Painters_, vol. iv.  chap. 1.]    15. But France is a country on a large scale. Low, but long, hills sweep  away for miles into vast uninterrupted champaigns; immense forests  shadow the country for hundreds of square miles, without once letting  through the light of day; its pastures and arable land are divided on  the same scale; there are no fences; we can hardly place ourselves in  any spot where we shall not see for leagues around; and there is a kind  of comfortless sublimity in the size of every scene. The French cottage,  therefore, is on the same scale, equally large and desolate looking;  but we shall see, presently, that it can arouse feelings which, though  they cannot be said to give it sublimity, yet are of a higher order than  any which can be awakened at the sight of the English cottage.    16. Again, every bit of cultivated ground in England has a finished  neatness; the fields are all divided by hedges or fences; the fruit  trees are neatly pruned; the roads beautifully made, etc. Everything is  the reverse in France: the fields are distinguished by the nature of the  crops they bear; the fruit trees are overgrown with moss and mistletoe;  and the roads immeasurably wide, and miserably made.    17. So much for the character of the two cottages, as they assimilate  with the countries in which they are found. Let us now see how they  assimilate with the character of the people by whom they are built.  England is a country of perpetually increasing prosperity and active  enterprise; but, for that very reason, nothing is allowed to remain till  it gets old. Large old trees are cut down for timber; old houses are  pulled down for the materials; and old furniture is laughed at and  neglected. Everything is perpetually altered and renewed by the activity  of invention and improvement. The cottage, consequently, has no  dilapidated look about it; it is never suffered to get old; it is used  as long as it is comfortable, and then taken down and rebuilt; for it  was originally raised in a style incapable of resisting the ravages of  time. But, in France, there prevail two opposite feelings, both in the  extreme; that of the old pedigreed population, which preserves  unlimitedly; and that of the modern revolutionists, which destroys  unmercifully. Every object has partly the appearance of having been  preserved with infinite care from an indefinite age, and partly exhibits  the evidence of recent ill-treatment and disfiguration. Primeval forests  rear their vast trunks over those of many younger generations growing up  beside them; the chateau or the palace, showing, by its style of  architecture, its venerable age, bears the marks of the cannon-ball,  and, from neglect, is withering into desolation. Little is renewed:  there is little spirit of improvement; and the customs which prevailed  centuries ago are still taught by the patriarchs of the families to  their grandchildren. The French cottage, therefore, is just such as we  should have expected from the disposition of its inhabitants; its  massive windows, its broken ornaments, its whole air and appearance, all  tell the same tale of venerable age, respected and preserved, till at  last its dilapidation wears an appearance of neglect.    18. Again, the Englishman will sacrifice everything to comfort, and  will not only take great pains to secure it, but he has generally also  the power of doing so: for the English peasant is, on the average,  wealthier than the French. The French peasant has no idea of comfort,  and therefore makes no effort to secure it. The difference in the  character of their inhabitants is, as we have seen, written on the  fronts of their respective cottages. The Englishman is, also, fond of  display; but the ornaments, exterior and interior, with which he adorns  his dwelling, however small it may be, are either to show the extent of  his possessions, or to contribute to some personal profit or  gratification: they never seem designed for the sake of ornament alone.  Thus, his wife's love of display is shown by the rows of useless  crockery in her cupboard; and his own by the rose tree at the front  door, from which he may obtain an early bud to stick in the buttonhole  of his best blue coat on Sundays: the honeysuckle is cultivated for its  smell, the garden for its cabbages. Not so in France. There, the meanest  peasant, with an equal or greater love of display, embellishes his  dwelling as much as lies in his power, solely for the gratification of  his feeling of what is agreeable to the eye. The gable of his roof is  prettily shaped; the niche at its corner is richly carved; the wooden  beams, if there be any, are fashioned into grotesque figures; and even  the \"air neglige\" and general dilapidation of the building tell a  thousand times more agreeably to an eye accustomed to the picturesque,  than the spruce preservation of the English cottage.    19. No building which we feel to excite a sentiment of mere complacency  can be said to be in good taste. On the contrary, when the building is  of such a class, that it can neither astonish by its beauty, nor impress  by its sublimity, and when it is likewise placed in a situation so  uninteresting as to render something more than mere fitness or propriety  necessary, and to compel the eye to expect something from the building  itself, a gentle contrast of feeling in that building is exceedingly  desirable; and if possible, a sense that something has passed away, the  presence of which would have bestowed a deeper interest on the whole  scene. The fancy will immediately try to recover this, and, in the  endeavor, will obtain the desired effect from an indefinite cause.    [Illustration: FIG. 1. Old Windows: from an early sketch by the Author.]    20. Now, the French cottage cannot please by its propriety, for it can  only be adapted to the ugliness around; and, as it ought to be, and  cannot but be, adapted to this, it is still less able to please by its  beauty. How, then, can it please? There is no pretense to gayety in its  appearance, no green flower-pots in ornamental lattices; but the  substantial style of any ornaments it may possess, the recessed windows,  the stone carvings, and the general size of the whole, unite to produce  an impression of the building having once been fit for the residence of  prouder inhabitants; of its having once possessed strength, which is now  withered, and beauty, which is now faded. This sense of something lost,  something which has been, and is not, is precisely what is wanted. The  imagination is set actively to work in an instant; and we are made aware  of the presence of a beauty, the more pleasing because visionary; and,  while the eye is pitying the actual humility of the present building,  the mind is admiring the imagined pride of the past. Every mark of  dilapidation increases this feeling; while these very marks (the  fractures of the stone, the lichens of the moldering walls, and the  graceful lines of the sinking roof) are all delightful in themselves.    21. Thus, we have shown that, while the English"]]]
