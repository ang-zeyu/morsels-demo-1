(#3)"],[1,", Spencer says, \"that forces standing in certain  correlations, form the whole contents of our idea of matter.\"    When we turn from the objective to the subjective, from the external to  the inward world, the result is still the same. He agrees with Hume in  saying that the contents of our consciousness is a series of impressions  and ideas. He dissents, however, from that philosopher, in saying that  that series is all we know. He admits that impressions necessarily imply  that there is something that is impressed. He starts the question, What  is it that thinks? and answers, We do not know. (p. 63). He admits that  the reality of individual personal minds, the conviction of personal  existence is universal, and perhaps indestructible. Nevertheless that  conviction cannot justify itself at the bar of reason; nay, reason is  found to reject it. (p. 65). Dean Mansel says, that consciousness gives  us a knowledge of self as a substance and not merely of its varying  states. This, however, he says, \"is absolutely negatived by the laws of  thought. The fundamental condition to all consciousness, emphatically  insisted upon by Mr. Mansel in common with Sir William Hamilton and  others, is the antithesis of subject and object.... What is the  corollary from this doctrine, as bearing on the consciousness of self?  The mental act in which self is known implies, like every other mental  act, a perceiving subject and a perceived object. If, then, the object  perceived is self, what is the subject that perceives? Or if it is the  true self which thinks, what other self can it be that is thought of?  Clearly, a true cognition of self implies a state in which the knowing  and the known are one--in which subject and object are identified; and  this Mr. Mansel rightly holds to be the annihilation of both. So that  the personality of which each is conscious, and of which the existence  is to each a fact beyond all others the most certain, is yet a thing  which cannot be known at all; knowledge of it is forbidden by the very  nature of human thought.\" (pp. 65, 66).    Mr. Spencer does not seem to expect that any man will be shaken in his  conviction by any such argument as that. When a man is conscious of  pain, he is not to be puzzled by telling him that the pain is one thing  (the object perceived) and the self another thing (the perceiving  subject). He knows that the pain is a state of the self of which he is  conscious. Consciousness is a form of knowledge; but knowledge of  necessity supposes an intelligent reality which knows. A philosophy  which cannot be received until men cease to believe in their own  existence, must be in extremis.    Mr. Spencer's conclusion is, that the universe--nature, or the external  world with all its marvels and perpetual changes,--the world of  consciousness with its ever varying states, are impressions or  phenomena, due to an inscrutable, persistent force.    As to the nature of this primal force or power, he quotes abundantly and  approvingly from Sir William Hamilton and Mr. Mansel, to prove that it  is unknowable, inconceivable, unthinkable. He, however, differs from  those distinguished writers in two points. While admitting that we know  no more of the first cause than we do of a geometrical figure which is  at once a circle and a square, yet we do know that it is actual. For  this conviction we are not dependent on faith. In the second place,  Hamilton and Mansel taught that we know that the Infinite cannot be a  person, self-conscious, intelligent, and voluntary; yet we are forced  by our moral constitution to believe it to be an intelligent person.  This Mr. Spencer denies. \"Let those,\" he says, \"who can, believe that  there is eternal war between our intellectual faculties and our moral  obligations. I, for one, admit of no such radical vice in the  constitution of things.\" (p. 108). Religion has always erred, he  asserts, in that while it teaches that the Infinite Being cannot be  known, it insists on ascribing to it such and such attributes, which of  course assumes that so far forth it is known. We have no right, he  contends, to ascribe personality to the \"Unknown Reality,\" or anything  else, except that it is the cause of all that we perceive or experience.  There may be a mode of being, as much transcending intelligence and  will, as these transcend mechanical motion. To show the folly of  referring to the Unknown the attributes of our own spirits, he makes  \"the grotesque supposition that the tickings and other movements of a  watch constituted a kind of consciousness; and that a watch possessed of  such a consciousness, insisted on regarding the watchmaker's actions as  determined like its own by springs and escapements.\" (p. 111). The vast  majority of men, instead of agreeing with Mr. Spencer in this matter,  will doubtless heartily, each for himself, join the German philosopher  Jacobi, in saying, \"I confess to Anthropomorphism inseparable from the  conviction that man bears the image of God; and maintain that besides  this Anthropomorphism, which has always been called Theism, is nothing  but Atheism or Fetichism.\"[4]    Mr. Spencer, therefore, in accounting for the origin of the universe and  all its phenomena, physical, vital, and mental, rejects Theism, or the  doctrine of a personal God, who is extramundane as well as antemundane,  the creator and governor of all things; he rejects Pantheism, which  makes the finite the existence-form of the Infinite; he rejects Atheism,  which he understands to be the doctrine of the eternity and  self-existence of matter and force. He contents himself with saying we  must acknowledge the reality of an unknown something which is the cause  of all things,--the noumenon of all phenomena. \"If science and religion  are to be reconciled, the basis of the reconciliation must be this  deepest, widest, and most certain of all facts,--that the Power which  the universe manifests is utterly inscrutable.\" (p. 46). \"The ultimate  of ultimates is Force.\" \"Matter and motion, as we know them, are  differently conditioned manifestations of force.\" \"If, to use an  algebraic illustration, we represent Matter, Motion, and Force, by the  symbols _x_, _y_, _z_; then we may ascertain the values of _x_ and _y_  in terms of _z_, but the value of _z_ can never be found; _z_ is the  unknown quantity, which must forever remain unknown, for the obvious  reason that there is nothing in which its value can be expressed.\" (pp.  169, 170).    We have, then, no God but Force. Atheist is everywhere regarded as a  term of reproach. Every man instinctively recoils from it. Even the  philosophers of the time of the French Revolution repudiated the charge  of atheism, because they believed in motion; and motion being  inscrutable, they believed in an inscrutable something, _i. e._ in  Force. We doubt not Mr. Spencer would indignantly reject the imputation  of atheism; nevertheless, in the judgment of most men, the difference  between Antitheist and Atheist is a mere matter of orthography.

Leipzig,  1816.      _Hylozoic Theory._    This theory assumes the universe to be eternal. There is nothing extra,  or antemundane. There is but one substance, and that substance is  matter. Matter, however, has an active and passive principle. Life and  rationality are among its attributes or functions. The universe,  therefore, is a living whole pervaded by a principle not only of life  but of intelligence. This hylozoic doctrine, some modern scientific men,  as Professor Tyndall, seem inclined to adopt. They tell us that matter  is not the dead and degraded thing it is commonly regarded. It is active  and transcendental. What that means, we do not know. The word  transcendental is like a parabola, in that there is no knowing where its  meaning ends. To say that matter is transcendental, is saying there is  no telling what it is up to. This habit of using words which have no  definite meaning is very convenient to writers, but very much the  reverse for readers. Some of the ancient Stoics distinguished between  the active and passive principles in the world, calling the one mind,  the other, matter. These however were as intimately united as matter and  life in a plant or animal.      _Theism in Unscriptural Forms._    There are men who are constrained to admit the being of God, who depart  from the Scriptural doctrine as to his relation to the world. According  to some, God created matter and endowed it with certain properties, and  then left it to itself to work out, without any interference or control  on his part, all possible results. According to others, He created not  only matter, but life, or living germs, one or more, from which without  any divine intervention all living organisms have been developed.  Others, again, refer not only matter and life, but mind also to the act  of the Creator; but with creation his agency ceases. He has no more to  do with the world, than a ship-builder has with the ship he has  constructed, when it is launched and far off upon the ocean. According  to all these views a creator is a mere _Deus ex machina_, an assumption  to account for the origin of the universe.    Another general view of God's relation to the world goes to the opposite  extreme. Instead of God doing nothing, He does everything. Second causes  have no efficiency. The laws of nature are said to be the uniform modes  of divine operation. Gravitation does not flow from the nature of  matter, but is a mode of God's uniform efficiency. What are called  chemical affinities are not due to anything in different kinds of  matter, but God always acts in one way in connection with an acid, and  in another way in connection with an alkali.

The       reactionary Chernsk nobility made Sukhotin marshal of nobility. So       it was this man who furnished the protocols of the secret meetings       of the representatives of Zion! But how did Sukhotin get the       protocols? An unknown friend had brought them to him. They were       given to him by an unknown lady who had received them from an       unknown but energetic participant in the Basle Congress. Is this       credible? Well, then, there is another version of the origin of the       protocols--but that is for the German readers. The Russian       government sent a spy to the Basle Congress. He did not go to the       Congress himself, but bribed one of the participants. He was       carrying the protocols from Basle to Frankfurt to the local masonic       organization. He stopped on the way in a little town, and gave the       protocols to the spy. He engaged copyists who worked all night and       copied the protocols.         \"In the first Russian version the protocols were supposed to have       been brought to Russia in French. According to the German version,       the protocols were copied, consequently they were in German, but       the most important thing is that the protocols are not protocols at       all, but a monograph--which could be called 'the dream of a member       of the Black Hundreds.'\"    A distinguished Russian publicist says of the sponsor of the \"protocols\"  as follows:         \"In Russia the problems of Christianity and Judaism have been       studied by such men as Vladimir Solovyov, Professor Troitzky,       Professor Kokovtsev, Kartashov, Bulgakov, Berdyayev--men of profound       intellect and a living conscience. In them the counterfeit ravings       of the ignorant monk (Nilus) evoked but a smile of contempt. The       low level of the circles in which men like Nilus moved and worked       is only too well known. It was the world of police denunciations,       divorce perjuries, monastic servility and feigned, blasphemous       piety. In order to attract attention, Nilus's 'Protocols of the       Wise Men of Zion' had to emigrate from Russia. And the further away       they went, the better they fared.\"          CHAPTER TWO    THE STORY FROM WHICH THE PROTOCOLS WERE FABRICATED    Essence of \"Protocols\" Was German Fiction of \"Sir John Retcliffe\"--Who  Was \"Retcliffe\"?--His Infamous Record--His Bloodcurdling Story--The Meeting  in the Cemetery--An Avowed Myth--Meeting Every Hundred Years Attended by  \"Representatives of the Twelve Tribes of Israel\"--The \"Son of the  Accursed\" Also Attends and Provides Comic Interludes.      The query now naturally arises, what is the origin of these much  heralded \"Protocols\" which were published in Russia by Sergius Nilus in  1905, and a copy of which, it is triumphantly announced, is now in the  British Museum?    The anti-Jewish propagandists everywhere content themselves with the  \"history\" of the origin of the \"Protocols\" as given by the \"Russian  mystic\" Sergius Nilus. But fortunately \"murder will out,\" and the  criminals who perpetrated the stupendous forgery for the purpose of  slandering the Jews have left behind clues that enable one to visualize  the very process that they pursued in the perpetration of their crime.    In 1866-1870 there appeared in Berlin a series of novels entitled  \"Biarritz--Rome\" purporting to have been written by \"Sir John Retcliffe,\"  the pseudonym of Herman Goedsche, a German novelist with an unsavory  past. To conceal his identity and to convey the impression that the  antisemitism with which his writings abounded emanated from English  sources, he selected \"Sir John Retcliffe\" as his pen-name.    According to _Meyer's Konversations Lexikon_ (Sixth edition, 1904,  Volume VIII, page 77), Herman Goedsche was born in February, 1815, in  Trachenberg, Silesia, and died on November 8, 1878, at Warmbrunn. He was  employed in the postal service, but as he was implicated in the Waldeck  forgery case, he left the service in 1849, and devoted himself to  literary work. Under the name of \"Armin\" he published a number of works  of fiction, but he was best known under the name of \"Sir John  Retcliffe,\" having published a series of sensational novels describing  the Crimean war, \"Sebastopol,\" \"Rena-Sahib,\" \"Villafranca,\" \"Puebla,\"  \"Biarritz,\" in 1866. A new edition of these works appeared in Berlin in  1903-4.    _Brockhaus' Konversations Lexikon_ (supplement volume XVII, 1904) refers  to Goedsche, the novelist, known under the name of \"Sir John Retcliffe\"  (formerly \"Armin\"), as having played an infamous role in the Waldeck  forgery case. He was compelled to leave the postal service, and later  became a member of the staff of the _Preussische Kreutz Zeitung_.    The chapter of the Goedsche-Retcliffe novel which on even a cursory  reading will be found to contain the very essence of the Nilus Protocols  was published as a separate booklet in a Russian translation in 1872,  avowedly as a work of fiction. I have found a copy of this little volume  in the Russian Department of the Library of Congress, Washington, D. C.    An examination of this chapter, entitled \"The Jewish Cemetery in Prague  and the Council of Representatives of the Twelve Tribes of Israel,\" will  disclose the fact that every substantive statement contained in the  Protocols and elaborated in them is to be found in the  Goedsche-Retcliffe novelette.    We are thus supplied with an early draft of the so-called Protocols,  which have now been given worldwide publicity by anti-Jewish  propagandists, and which were first introduced to the world in the form  of a clumsy piece of blood-curdling fiction of the dime-novel variety.    In substantiation of this statement I now present a translation of this  chapter of the Russian version of this novel found in the Library of  Congress in Washington, published in St. Petersburg nearly fifty years  ago.
