Between your  consciousness and mine there exists a wide gap that cannot be bridged.  Each of us lives apart. We are like ships that pass and hail each other  in passing but do not touch. We may work together, live together, come  to love or hate each other, and yet our inmost selves forever stand  alone. They must live their own lives, think their own thoughts, and  arrive at their own destiny.    INTROSPECTION THE ONLY MEANS OF DISCOVERING NATURE OF  CONSCIOUSNESS.--What, then, is mind? What is the thing that we call  consciousness? No mere definition can ever make it clearer than it is at  this moment to each of us. The only way to know what mind is, is to look  in upon our own consciousness and observe what is transpiring there. In  the language of the psychologist, we must _introspect_. For one can  never come to understand the nature of mind and its laws of working by  listening to lectures or reading text books alone. There is no  _psychology_ in the text, but only in your living, flowing stream of  thought and mine. True, the lecture and the book may tell us what to  look for when we introspect, and how to understand what we find. But the  statements and descriptions about our minds must be verified by our own  observation and experience before they become vital truth to us.    HOW WE INTROSPECT.--Introspection is something of an art; it has to be  learned. Some master it easily, some with more difficulty, and some, it  is to be feared, never become skilled in its use. In order to introspect  one must catch himself unawares, so to speak, in the very act of  thinking, remembering, deciding, loving, hating, and all the rest. These  fleeting phases of consciousness are ever on the wing; they never pause  in their restless flight and we must catch them as they go. This is not  so easy as it appears; for the moment we turn to look in upon the mind,  that moment consciousness changes. The thing we meant to examine is  gone, and something else has taken its place. All that is left us then  is to view the mental object while it is still fresh in the memory, or  to catch it again when it returns.    STUDYING MENTAL STATES OF OTHERS THROUGH EXPRESSION.--Although I can  meet only my own mind face to face, I am, nevertheless, under the  necessity of judging your mental states and knowing what is taking place  in your consciousness. For in order to work successfully with you, in  order to teach you, understand you, control you or obey you, be your  friend or enemy, or associate with you in any other way, I must _know_  you. But the real you that I must know is hidden behind the physical  mask that we call the body. I must, therefore, be able to understand  your states of consciousness as they are reflected in your bodily  expressions. Your face, form, gesture, speech, the tone of voice,  laughter and tears, the poise of attention, the droop of grief, the  tenseness of anger and start of fear,--all these tell the story of the  mental state that lies behind the senses. These various expressions are  the pictures on the screen by which your mind reveals itself to others;  they are the language by which the inner self speaks to the world  without.    LEARNING TO INTERPRET EXPRESSION.--If I would understand the workings of  your mind I must therefore learn to read the language of physical  expression. I must study human nature and learn to observe others. I  must apply the information found in the texts to an interpretation of  those about me. This study of others may be _uncritical_, as in the mere  intelligent observation of those I meet; or it may be _scientific_, as  when I conduct carefully planned psychological experiments. But in  either case it consists in judging the inner states of consciousness by  their physical manifestations.    The three methods by which mind may be studied are, then: (1) text-book  _description and explanation_; (2) _introspection_ of my own conscious  processes; and (3) _observation_ of others, either uncritical or  scientific.      2. THE NATURE OF CONSCIOUSNESS    INNER NATURE OF THE MIND NOT REVEALED BY INTROSPECTION.--We are not to  be too greatly discouraged if, even by introspection, we cannot discover  exactly _what_ the mind is. No one knows what electricity is, though  nearly everyone uses it in one form or another. We study the dynamo, the  motor, and the conductors through which electricity manifests itself. We  observe its effects in light, heat, and mechanical power, and so learn  the laws which govern its operations. But we are almost as far from  understanding its true nature as were the ancients who knew nothing of  its uses. The dynamo does not create the electricity, but only furnishes  the conditions which make it possible for electricity to manifest  itself in doing the world's work. Likewise the brain or nervous system  does not create the mind, but it furnishes the machine through which the  mind works. We may study the nervous system and learn something of the  conditions and limitations under which the mind operates, but this is  not studying the mind itself. As in the case of electricity, what we  know about the mind we must learn through the activities in which it  manifests itself--these we can know, for they are in the experience of  all. It is, then, only by studying these processes of consciousness that  we come to know the laws which govern the mind and its development.  _What_ it is that thinks and feels and wills in us is too hard a problem  for us here--indeed, has been too hard a problem for the philosophers  through the ages. But the thinking and feeling and willing we can watch  as they occur, and hence come to know.    CONSCIOUSNESS AS A PROCESS OR STREAM.--In looking in upon the mind we  must expect to discover, then, not a _thing_, but a _process_. The  _thing_ forever eludes us, but the process is always present.  Consciousness is like a stream, which, so far as we are concerned with  it in a psychological discussion, has its rise at the cradle and its end  at the grave. It begins with the babe's first faint gropings after light  in his new world as he enters it, and ends with the man's last blind  gropings after light in his old world as he leaves it. The stream is  very narrow at first, only as wide as the few sensations which come to  the babe when it sees the light or hears the sound; it grows wider as  the mind develops, and is at last measured by the grand sum total of  life's experience.    This mental stream is irresistible. No power outside of us can stop it  while life lasts. We cannot stop it ourselves. When we try to stop  thinking, the stream but changes its direction and flows on. While we  wake and while we sleep, while we are unconscious under an anaesthetic,  even, some sort of mental process continues. Sometimes the stream flows  slowly, and our thoughts lag--we \"feel slow\"; again the stream flows  faster, and we are lively and our thoughts come with a rush; or a fever  seizes us and delirium comes on; then the stream runs wildly onward,  defying our control, and a mad jargon of thoughts takes the place of our  usual orderly array. In different persons, also, the mental stream moves  at different rates, some minds being naturally slow-moving and some  naturally quick in their operations.    Consciousness resembles a stream also in other particulars. A stream is  an unbroken whole from its source to its mouth, and an observer  stationed at one point cannot see all of it at once. He sees but the one  little section which happens to be passing his station point at the  time. The current may look much the same from moment to moment, but the  component particles which constitute the stream are constantly changing.  So it is with our thought. Its stream is continuous from birth till  death, but we cannot see any considerable portion of it at one time.  When we turn about quickly and look in upon our minds, we see but the  little present moment. That of a few seconds ago is gone and will never  return. The thought which occupied us a moment since can no more be  recalled, just as it was, than can the particles composing a stream be  re-collected and made to pass a given point in its course in precisely  the same order and relation to one another as before. This means, then,  that we can never have precisely the same mental state twice; that the  thought of the moment cannot have the same associates that it had the  first time; that the thought of this moment will never be ours again;  that all we can know of our minds at any one time is the part of the  process present in consciousness at that moment.    [Illustration: FIG. 1]    [Illustration: FIG. 2]    THE WAVE IN THE STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS.--The surface of our mental  stream is not level, but is broken by a wave which stands above the  rest; which is but another way of saying that some one thing is always  more prominent in our thought than the rest. Only when we are in a  sleepy reverie, or not thinking about much of anything, does the stream  approximate a level. At all other times some one object occupies the  highest point in our thought, to the more or less complete exclusion of  other things which we might think about. A thousand and one objects are  possible to our thought at any moment, but all except one thing occupy a  secondary place, or are not present to our consciousness at all. They  exist on the margin, or else are clear off the edge of consciousness,  while the one thing occupies the center. We may be reading a fascinating  book late at night in a cold room. The charm of the writer, the beauty  of the heroine, or the bravery of the hero so occupies the mind that the  weary eyes and chattering teeth are unnoticed. Consciousness has piled  up in a high wave on the points of interest in the book, and the bodily  sensations are for the moment on a much lower level.

Howard.           *       *       *       *       *                           VITRUVIUS           *       *       *       *       *          BOOK I          PREFACE      1. While your divine intelligence and will, Imperator Caesar, were  engaged in acquiring the right to command the world, and while your  fellow citizens, when all their enemies had been laid low by your  invincible valour, were glorying in your triumph and victory,--while all  foreign nations were in subjection awaiting your beck and call, and the  Roman people and senate, released from their alarm, were beginning to be  guided by your most noble conceptions and policies, I hardly dared, in  view of your serious employments, to publish my writings and long  considered ideas on architecture, for fear of subjecting myself to your  displeasure by an unseasonable interruption.    2. But when I saw that you were giving your attention not only to the  welfare of society in general and to the establishment of public order,  but also to the providing of public buildings intended for utilitarian  purposes, so that not only should the State have been enriched with  provinces by your means, but that the greatness of its power might  likewise be attended with distinguished authority in its public  buildings, I thought that I ought to take the first opportunity to lay  before you my writings on this theme. For in the first place it was this  subject which made me known to your father, to whom I was devoted on  account of his great qualities. After the council of heaven gave him a  place in the dwellings of immortal life and transferred your father's  power to your hands, my devotion continuing unchanged as I remembered  him inclined me to support you. And so with Marcus Aurelius, Publius  Minidius, and Gnaeus Cornelius, I was ready to supply and repair  ballistae, scorpiones, and other artillery, and I have received rewards  for good service with them. After your first bestowal of these upon me,  you continued to renew them on the recommendation of your sister.    3. Owing to this favour I need have no fear of want to the end of my  life, and being thus laid under obligation I began to write this work  for you, because I saw that you have built and are now building  extensively, and that in future also you will take care that our public  and private buildings shall be worthy to go down to posterity by the  side of your other splendid achievements. I have drawn up definite rules  to enable you, by observing them, to have personal knowledge of the  quality both of existing buildings and of those which are yet to be  constructed. For in the following books I have disclosed all the  principles of the art.          CHAPTER I    THE EDUCATION OF THE ARCHITECT      1. The architect should be equipped with knowledge of many branches of  study and varied kinds of learning, for it is by his judgement that all  work done by the other arts is put to test. This knowledge is the child  of practice and theory. Practice is the continuous and regular exercise  of employment where manual work is done with any necessary material  according to the design of a drawing. Theory, on the other hand, is the  ability to demonstrate and explain the productions of dexterity on the  principles of proportion.    2. It follows, therefore, that architects who have aimed at acquiring  manual skill without scholarship have never been able to reach a  position of authority to correspond to their pains, while those who  relied only upon theories and scholarship were obviously hunting the  shadow, not the substance. But those who have a thorough knowledge of  both, like men armed at all points, have the sooner attained their  object and carried authority with them.    3. In all matters, but particularly in architecture, there are these two  points:--the thing signified, and that which gives it its significance.  That which is signified is the subject of which we may be speaking; and  that which gives significance is a demonstration on scientific  principles. It appears, then, that one who professes himself an  architect should be well versed in both directions. He ought, therefore,  to be both naturally gifted and amenable to instruction. Neither natural  ability without instruction nor instruction without natural ability can  make the perfect artist. Let him be educated, skilful with the pencil,  instructed in geometry, know much history, have followed the  philosophers with attention, understand music, have some knowledge of  medicine, know the opinions of the jurists, and be acquainted with  astronomy and the theory of the heavens.    4. The reasons for all this are as follows. An architect ought to be an  educated man so as to leave a more lasting remembrance in his treatises.  Secondly, he must have a knowledge of drawing so that he can readily  make sketches to show the appearance of the work which he proposes.  Geometry, also, is of much assistance in architecture, and in particular  it teaches us the use of the rule and compasses, by which especially we  acquire readiness in making plans for buildings in their grounds, and  rightly apply the square, the level, and the plummet. By means of  optics, again, the light in buildings can be drawn from fixed quarters  of the sky. It is true that it is by arithmetic that the total cost of  buildings is calculated and measurements are computed, but difficult  questions involving symmetry are solved by means of geometrical theories  and methods.    5. A wide knowledge of history is requisite because, among the  ornamental parts of an architect's design for a work, there are many the  underlying idea of whose employment he should be able to explain to  inquirers. For instance, suppose him to set up the marble statues of  women in long robes, called Caryatides, to take the place of columns,  with the mutules and coronas placed directly above their heads, he will  give the following explanation to his questioners. Caryae, a state in  Peloponnesus, sided with the Persian enemies against Greece; later the  Greeks, having gloriously won their freedom by victory in the war, made  common cause and declared war against the people of Caryae. They took  the town, killed the men, abandoned the State to desolation, and carried  off their wives into slavery, without permitting them, however, to lay  aside the long robes and other marks of their rank as married women, so  that they might be obliged not only to march in the triumph but to  appear forever after as a type of slavery, burdened with the weight of  their shame and so making atonement for their State. Hence, the  architects of the time designed for public buildings statues of these  women, placed so as to carry a load, in order that the sin and the  punishment of the people of Caryae might be known and handed down even  to posterity.    [Illustration: Photo. H. B. Warren CARYATIDES OF THE ERECHTHEUM AT  ATHENS]    [Illustration: CARYATIDES FROM THE TREASURY OF THE CNIDIANS AT DELPHI]    [Illustration: Photo. Anderson CARYATIDES NOW IN THE VILLA ALBANI AT  ROME]    [Illustration: CARYATIDES (From the edition of Vitruvius by Fra  Giocondo, Venice, 1511)]    6. Likewise the Lacedaemonians under the leadership of Pausanias, son of  Agesipolis, after conquering the Persian armies, infinite in number,  with a small force at the battle of Plataea, celebrated a glorious  triumph with the spoils and booty, and with the money obtained from the  sale thereof built the Persian Porch, to be a monument to the renown and  valour of the people and a trophy of victory for posterity. And there  they set effigies of the prisoners arrayed in barbarian costume and  holding up the roof, their pride punished by this deserved affront,  that enemies might tremble for fear of the effects of their courage,  and that their own people, looking upon this ensample of their valour  and encouraged by the glory of it, might be ready to defend their  independence. So from that time on, many have put up statues of Persians  supporting entablatures and their ornaments, and thus from that motive  have greatly enriched the diversity of their works. There are other  stories of the same kind which architects ought to know.    7. As for philosophy, it makes an architect high-minded and not  self-assuming, but rather renders him courteous, just, and honest  without avariciousness. This is very important, for no work can be  rightly done without honesty and"]]]
