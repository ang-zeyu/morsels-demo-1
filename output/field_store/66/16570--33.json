[[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19092"],[0,"The Adventures of Paddy Beaver (#3)"],[1,"in the  Smiling Pool there was hardly water enough for the minnows to feel safe  a minute. Billy Mink had stopped making fun of the dam, and all the  little people who live in the Laughing Brook and the Smiling Pool were  terribly worried.    To be sure Paddy had warned them of what he was going to do, and had  promised that just as soon as his pond was big enough, the water would  once more run in the Laughing Brook. They tried to believe him, but they  couldn't help having just a wee bit of fear that he might not be wholly  honest. You see, they didn't know him, for he was a stranger. Jerry  Muskrat was the only one who seemed absolutely sure that everything  would be all right. Perhaps that was because Paddy is his cousin, and  Jerry couldn't help but feel proud of such a big cousin and one who was  so smart.    So day by day the dam grew, and the pond grew, and then one morning  Grandfather Frog, down in what had once been the Smiling Pool, heard a  sound that made his heart jump for joy. It was a murmur that kept  growing and growing, until at last it was the merry laugh of the  Laughing Brook. Then he knew that Paddy had kept his word and water  would once more fill the Smiling Pool.          VI    FARMER BROWN'S BOY GROWS CURIOUS      Now it happened that the very day before Paddy the Beaver decided that  his pond was big enough, and so allowed the water to run in the Laughing  Brook once more, Farmer Brown's boy took it into his head to go fishing  in the Smiling Pool. Just as usual he went whistling down across the  Green Meadows. Somehow, when he goes fishing, he always feels like  whistling. Grandfather Frog heard him coming and dived into the little  bit of water remaining in the Smiling Pool and stirred up the mud at the  bottom so that Farmer Brown's boy shouldn't see him.    Nearer and nearer drew the whistle. Suddenly it stopped right short off.  Farmer Brown's boy had come in sight of the Smiling Pool or rather, it  was what used to be the Smiling Pool. Now there wasn't any Smiling Pool,  for the very little pool left was too small and sickly-looking to smile.  There were great banks of mud, out of which grew the bulrushes. The  lily-pads were forlornly stretched out towards the tiny pool of water  remaining. Where the banks were steep and high, the holes that Jerry  Muskrat and Billy Mink knew so well were plain to see. Over at one side  stood Jerry Muskrat's house, wholly out of water.    Somehow, it seemed to Farmer Brown's boy that he must be dreaming. He  never, never had seen anything like this before, not even in the very  driest weather of the hottest part of the summer. He looked this way and  looked that way. The Green Meadows looked just as usual. The Green  Forest looked just as usual. The Laughing Brook--ha! What was the matter  with the Laughing Brook? He couldn't hear it and that, you know, was  very unusual. He dropped his rod and ran over to the Laughing Brook.  There wasn't any brook. No, sir, there wasn't any brook; just pools of  water with the tiniest of streams trickling between. Big stones over  which he had always seen the water running in the prettiest of little  white falls were bare and dry. In the little pools frightened minnows  were darting about.    Farmer Brown's boy scratched his head in a puzzled way. \"I don't  understand it,\" said he. \"I don't understand it at all. Something must  have gone wrong with the springs that supply the water for the Laughing  Brook. They must have failed. Yes, Sir, that is just what must have  happened. But I never heard of such a thing happening before, and I  really don't see how it could happen.\" He stared up into the Green  Forest just as if he thought he could see those springs. Of course, he  didn't think anything of the kind. He was just turning it all over in  his mind. \"I know what I'll do! I'll go up to those springs this  afternoon and find out what the trouble is,\" he said out loud. \"They are  way over almost on the other side of the Green Forest, and the easiest  way to get there will be to start from home and cut across the Old  Pasture up to the edge of the Mountain behind the Green Forest. If I try  to follow up the Laughing Brook now, it will take too long, because it  winds and twists so. Besides, it is too hard work.\"    With that, Farmer Brown's boy went back and picked up his rod. Then he  started for home across the Green Meadows, and for once he wasn't  whistling. You see, he was too busy thinking. In fact, he was so busy  thinking that he didn't see Jimmy Skunk until he almost stepped on him,  and then he gave a frightened jump and ran, for without a gun he was  just as much afraid of Jimmy as Jimmy was of him when he did have a gun.    Jimmy just grinned and went on about his business. It always tickles  Jimmy to see people run away from him, especially people so much bigger  than himself; they look so silly.    \"I should think that they would have learned by this time that if  they don't bother me, I won't bother them,\" he muttered, as he rolled  over a stone to look for fat beetles. \"Somehow, folks never seem to  understand me.\"    [Illustration]          VII    FARMER BROWN'S BOY GETS ANOTHER SURPRISE      Across the Old Pasture to the foot of the Mountain back of the Green  Forest tramped Farmer Brown's boy. Ahead of him trotted Bowser the  Hound, sniffing and snuffing for the tracks of Reddy or Granny Fox. Of  course he didn't find them, for Reddy and Granny hadn't been up in the  Old Pasture for a long time. But he did find old Jed Thumper, the big  gray Rabbit who had made things so uncomfortable for Peter Rabbit once  upon a time, and gave him such a fright that old Jed didn't look where  he was going and almost ran headfirst into Farmer Brown's boy.    \"Hi, there, you old cottontail!\" yelled Farmer Brown's boy, and this  frightened Old Jed still more, so that he actually ran right past his  own castle of bullbriars without seeing it.    Farmer Brown's boy kept on his way, laughing at the fright of old Jed  Thumper. Presently he reached the springs from which came the water that  made the very beginning of the Laughing Brook. He expected to find them  dry, for way down on the Green Meadows the Smiling Pool was nearly dry,  and the Laughing Brook was nearly dry, and he had supposed that of  course the reason was that the springs where the Laughing Brook started  were no longer bubbling.    But they were! The clear cold water came bubbling up out of the ground  just as it always had, and ran off down into the Green Forest in a  little stream that would grow and grow as it ran and become the Laughing  Brook. Farmer Brown's boy took off his ragged old straw hat and scowled  down at the bubbling water just as if he thought it had no business to  be bubbling there.    Of course, he didn't think just that. The fact is, he didn't know just  what he did think. Here were the springs bubbling away just as they  always had. There was the little stream starting off down into the Green  Forest with a gurgle that by and by would become a laugh, just as it  always had. And yet down on the Green Meadows on the other side of the  Green Forest there was no longer a Laughing Brook or a Smiling Pool. He  felt as if he ought to pinch himself to make sure that he was awake and  not dreaming.    \"I don't know what it means,\" said he, talking out loud. \"No, Sir, I  don't know what it means at all, but I'm going to find out. There's a  cause for everything in this world, and when a fellow doesn't know a  thing, it is his business to find out all about it. I'm going to find  out what has happened to the Laughing Brook, if it takes me a year!\"    With that he started to follow the little stream which ran gurgling  down into the Green Forest. He had followed that little stream more than  once, and now he found it just as he remembered it. The farther it ran,  the larger it grew, until at last it became the Laughing Brook, merrily  tumbling over rocks and making deep pools in which the trout loved to  hide. At last he came to the edge of a little open hollow in the very  heart of the Green Forest. He knew what splendid deep holes there were  in the Laughing Brook here, and how the big trout loved to lie in them  because they were deep and cool. He was thinking of these trout now and  wishing that he had brought along his fishing-rod. He pushed his way  through a thicket of alders and then--Farmer Brown's boy stopped  suddenly and fairly gasped! He had to stop because there right in front  of him was a pond!    He rubbed his eyes and looked again. Then he stooped down and put his  hand in the water to see if it was real. There was no doubt about it. It  was real water,--a real pond where there never had been a pond before.  It was very still there in the heart of the Green Forest. It was always  very still there, but it seemed stiller than usual as he tramped around  the edge of this strange pond. He felt as if it were all a dream. He  wondered if pretty soon he wouldn't wake up and find it all untrue. But  he didn't, and so he kept on tramping until presently he came to a  dam,--a splendid dam of logs and sticks and mud. Over the top of it the  water was running, and down in the Green Forest below he could hear the  Laughing Brook just beginning to laugh once more. Farmer Brown's boy sat  down with his elbows on his knees and his chin in his hands. He was  almost too much surprised to even think.    [Illustration]          VIII    PETER RABBIT GETS A DUCKING      Farmer Brown's boy sat with his chin in his hands staring at the new  pond in the Green Forest and at the dam which had made it. That dam  puzzled him. Who could have built it? What did they build it for? Why  hadn't he heard them chopping? He looked carelessly at the stump of one  of the trees, and then a still more puzzled look made deep furrows  between his eyes. It looked--yes, it looked very much as if teeth, and  not an axe, had cut down that tree.

The names given to the feast by different European peoples throw a  certain amount of light on its history. Let us take five of  them--_Christmas_, _Weihnacht_, _Noel_, _Calendas_, and _Yule_--and see  what they suggest.    I. The English _Christmas_ and its Dutch equivalent _Kerstmisse_, plainly  point to the ecclesiastical side of the festival; the German  _Weihnacht_{4} (sacred night) is vaguer, and might well be either pagan  or Christian; in point of fact it seems to be Christian, since it does  not appear till the year 1000, when the Faith was well established in  Germany.{5} _Christmas_ and _Weihnacht_, then, may stand for the  distinctively Christian festival, the history of which we may now briefly  study.    When and where did the keeping of Christmas begin? Many details of its  early history remain in uncertainty, but it is fairly clear that the  earliest celebration of the Birth of Christ on December 25 took place at  Rome about the middle of the fourth century, and that the observance of  the day spread from the western to the eastern Church, which had before  been wont to keep January 6 as a joint commemoration of the Nativity and  the Baptism of the Redeemer.[3]    The first mention of a Nativity feast on December 25 is found in a Roman  document known as the Philocalian Calendar, dating from the year 354, but  embodying an older document evidently belonging to the year 336. It is  uncertain to which date the Nativity reference belongs;[4] but further  back than 336 at all events the festival cannot be traced.    From Rome, Christmas spread throughout the West, with the |21| conversion  of the barbarians. Whether it came to England through the Celtic Church  is uncertain, but St. Augustine certainly brought it with him, and  Christmas Day, 598, witnessed a great event, the baptism of more than  ten thousand English converts.{9} In 567 the Council of Tours had  declared the Twelve Days, from Christmas to Epiphany, a festal tide;{10}  the laws of Ethelred (991-1016) ordained it to be a time of peace and  concord among Christian men, when all strife must cease.{11} In Germany  Christmas was established by the Synod of Mainz in 813;{12} in Norway by  King Hakon the Good about the middle of the tenth century.{13}    In the East, as has been seen, the Birth of the Redeemer was at first  celebrated not on December 25, but on January 6, the feast of the  Epiphany or manifestation of Christ's glory. The Epiphany can be traced  as far back as the second century, among the Basilidian heretics, from  whom it may have spread to the Catholic Church. It was with them  certainly a feast of the Baptism, and possibly also of the Nativity, of  Christ. The origins of the Epiphany festival{14} are very obscure, nor  can we say with certainty what was its meaning at first. It may be that  it took the place of a heathen rite celebrating the birth of the World or  AEon from the Virgin on January 6.[5] At all events one of its objects was  to commemorate the Baptism, the appearance of the Holy Dove, and the  Voice from heaven, \"Thou art my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased\"  (or, as other MSS. read, \"This day have I begotten thee\").    |22| In some circles of early Christianity the Baptism appears to have  been looked upon as the true Birth of Christ, the moment when, filled by  the Spirit, He became Son of God; and the carnal Birth was regarded as of  comparatively little significance. Hence the Baptism festival may have  arisen first, and the celebration of the Birth at Bethlehem may have been  later attached to the same day, partly perhaps because a passage in St.  Luke's Gospel was supposed to imply that Jesus was baptized on His  thirtieth birthday. As however the orthodox belief became more sharply  defined, increasing stress was laid on the Incarnation of God in Christ  in the Virgin's womb, and it may have been felt that the celebration of  the Birth and the Baptism on the same day encouraged heretical views.  Hence very likely the introduction of Christmas on December 25 as a  festival of the Birth alone. In the East the concelebration of the two  events continued for some time after Rome had instituted the separate  feast of Christmas. Gradually, however, the Roman use spread: at  Constantinople it was introduced about 380 by the great theologian,  Gregory Nazianzen; at Antioch it appeared in 388, at Alexandria in 432.  The Church of Jerusalem long stood out, refusing to adopt the new feast  till the seventh century, it would seem.{18} One important Church, the  Armenian, knows nothing of December 25, and still celebrates the Nativity  with the Epiphany on January 6.{19} Epiphany in the eastern Orthodox  Church has lost its connection with the Nativity and is now chiefly a  celebration of the Baptism of Christ, while in the West, as every one  knows, it is primarily a celebration of the Adoration by the Magi, an  event commemorated by the Greeks on Christmas Day. Epiphany is, however,  as we shall see, a greater festival in the Greek Church than Christmas.    Such in bare outline is the story of the spread of Christmas as an  independent festival. Its establishment fitly followed the triumph of the  Catholic doctrine of the perfect Godhead or Christ at the Council of  Nicea in 325.    II. The French _Noel_ is a name concerning whose origin there has been  considerable dispute; there can, however, be little doubt that it is the  same word as the Provencal _Nadau_ or _Nadal_, |23| the Italian  _Natale_, and the Welsh _Nadolig_, all obviously derived from the Latin  _natalis_, and meaning \"birthday.\" One naturally takes this as referring  to the Birth of Christ, but it may at any rate remind us of another  birthday celebrated on the same date by the Romans of the Empire, that of  the unconquered Sun, who on December 25, the winter solstice according to  the Julian calendar, began to rise to new vigour after his autumnal  decline.    Why, we may ask, did the Church choose December 25 for the celebration of  her Founder's Birth? No one now imagines that the date is supported by a  reliable tradition; it is only one of various guesses of early Christian  writers. As a learned eighteenth-century Jesuit{20} has pointed out,  there is not a single month in the year to which the Nativity has not  been assigned by some writer or other. The real reason for the choice of  the day most probably was, that upon it fell the pagan festival just  mentioned.    The _Dies Natalis Invicti_ was probably first celebrated in Rome by order  of the Emperor Aurelian (270-5), an ardent worshipper of the Syrian  sun-god Baal.{21} With the _Sol Invictus_ was identified the figure of  Mithra, that strange eastern god whose cult resembled in so many ways the  worship of Jesus, and who was at one time a serious rival of the Christ  in the minds of thoughtful men.[6]{22} It was the sun-god, poetically  and philosophically conceived, whom the Emperor Julian made the centre of  his ill-fated revival of paganism, and there is extant a fine prayer of  his to \"King Sun.\"{23}    What more natural than that the Church should choose this day to  celebrate the rising of her Sun of Righteousness with healing in His  wings, that she should strive thus to draw away to His worship some  adorers of the god whose symbol and representative was the earthly sun!  There is no direct evidence of deliberate substitution, but at all events  ecclesiastical writers soon after the foundation of Christmas made good  use of the idea |24| that the birthday of the Saviour had replaced the  birthday of the sun.[7]    Little is known of the manner in which the _Natalis Invicti_ was kept; it  was not a folk-festival, and was probably observed by the classes rather  than the masses.{24} Its direct influence on Christmas customs has  probably been little or nothing. It fell, however, just before a Roman  festival that had immense popularity, is of great importance for our  subject, and is recalled by another name for Christmas that must now be  considered.    III. The Provencal _Calendas_ or _Calenos_, the Polish _Kolenda_, the  Russian _Kolyada_, the Czech _Koleda_ and the Lithuanian _Kalledos_, not  to speak of the Welsh _Calenig_ for Christmas-box, and the Gaelic  _Calluinn_ for New Year's Eve, are all derived from the Latin _Kalendae_,  and suggest the connection of Christmas with the Roman New Year's Day,  the Kalends or the first day of January, a time celebrated with many  festive customs. What these were, and how they have affected Christmas we  shall see in some detail in Part II.; suffice it to say here that the  festival, which lasted for at least three days, was one of riotous life,  of banqueting and games and licence. It was preceded, moreover, by the  _Saturnalia_ (December 17 to 23) which had many like features, and must  have formed practically one festive season with it. The word _Saturnalia_  has become so familiar in modern usage as to suggest sufficiently the  character of the festival for which it stands.    |25| Into the midst of this season of revelry and licence the Church  introduced her celebration of the beginning of man's redemption from the  bondage of sin. Who can wonder that Christmas contains incongruous  elements, for old things, loved by the people, cannot easily be uprooted.    IV. One more name yet remains to be considered, _Yule_ (Danish _Jul_),  the ordinary word for Christmas in the Scandinavian languages, and not  extinct among ourselves. Its derivation has been widely discussed, but so  far no satisfactory explanation of it has been found. Professor Skeat in  the last edition of his Etymological Dictionary (1910) has to admit that  its origin is unknown. Whatever its source may be,"]]]
