The family and the state,  however, side by side worshipped a number of deities.    In the primitive hut, the model of which has come down to us in so many  little burial urns of early time (for example those that have recently  been dug up in the wonderful cemetery under the Roman Forum), with its  one door and no window, there were several elements which needed  propitiation; the door itself as the keeper away of evil, the hearth,  and the niche for the storage of food. The door-god was the god-door  Janus, the _ianua_ itself; the hearth was in the care of the womenfolk,  the wife and daughters, so it was a goddess, Vesta, whom they served;  and the storage-niche, the _penus_, was in the keeping of the  \"store-closet gods\" (_Di Penates_). The state itself was modelled after  the house. It had its Janus, its sacred door, down in the Forum, and the  king himself, the father of the state, was his special priest; it had  its hearth, where the sacred fire burned, and its own Vesta, tended by  the vestal virgins, the daughters of the state; and it had its  store-niche with its Penates. At a later date but still very early there  was added to the household worship the idea of the general protector of  the house, the Lar, which gave rise to the familiar expression \"Lares  and Penates.\" The origin of this _Lar Familiaris_, as he is called, is  interesting, because it shows the intimate connection between the  farming life of the community and its religion. The Lares were  originally the group of gods who looked after the various farms; they  were in the plural because they were worshipped where the boundary lines  of several farms met, but though several of them were worshipped  together, each farm had its one individual Lar. But the care of the farm  included also the protection of the house on the farm, so that the Lar  of the farm became also the Lar of the house, first of course of houses  on farms, and then of every house everywhere even when no farm was  connected with it.    Aside from Vesta, the Genius, the Lar, and the Penates, possibly the  most important element in family worship was the cult of the dead  ancestors. This cult is, of course, common to almost all religions, and  its presence in Roman religion is in so far not surprising, but the form  in which it occurs there is curious and relatively rare. Just as the  living man has a \"double,\" the Genius, so the dead man also must have a  double, but this double is originally not the Genius, who seems to have  been thought of at first as ceasing with the individual. On the contrary  as death is the great leveller and the remover of individuality, so the  double of the dead was not thought of at first as an individual double  but merely as forming a part of an indefinite mass of spirits, the \"good  gods\" (_Di Manes_) as they were called because they were feared as being  anything but good. These _Di Manes_ had therefore no specific relation  to the individual, and the individual really ceased at death; the only  human relation which the _Di Manes_ seem to have preserved was a  connection with the living members of the family to which they had  originally belonged. It is therefore very misleading to assert that the  Romans had from the beginning a belief in immortality, when we  instinctively think of the immortality of the individual. The thing that  was immortal was not the individual but the family. It is thoroughly in  keeping with the practical character of the Roman mind that they did not  concern themselves with the place in which these spirits of the dead  were supposed to reside, but merely with the door through which they  could and did return to earth. We have no accounts of the Lower World  until Greece lent her mythology to Rome, and imagination never built  anything like the Greek palace of Pluto. But while they did not waste  energy in furnishing the Lower World with the fittings of fancy, they  did keep a careful guard over the door of egress. This door they called  the _mundus_, and represented it crudely by a trench or shallow pit, at  the bottom of which there lay a stone. On certain days of the year this  stone was removed, and then the spirits came back to earth again, where  they were received and entertained by the living members of their  family. There were a number of these days in the year, three of them  scattered through the year: August 24, October 5, November 8; and two  sets of days: February 13-21 and May 9, 11, 13. The February  celebration, the so-called _Parentalia_, was calm and dignified and  represented all that was least superstitious and fearful in the  generally terrifying worship of the dead. The _Lemuria_ in May had  exactly the opposite character and belongs to the category of the  \"expulsion of evil spirits,\" of which Mr. Frazer in his _Golden Bough_  has given so many instances.    In this connection it is interesting to notice two facts which stand  almost as corollaries to these beliefs. One fact is the religious  necessity for the continuance of the family, in order that there might  always be a living representative of the family to perform the  sacrifices to the ancestors. It was the duty of the head of the family  not only to perform these sacrifices himself as long as he lived but  also to provide a successor. The usual method was by marriage and the  rearing of a family, but, in case there was no male child in the family,  adoption was recurred to. Here it is peculiarly significant that the  sanction of the chief priest was necessary, and he never gave his  consent in case the man to be adopted was the only representative of his  family, so that his removal from that family into another would leave  his original family without a male representative. In cases of  inheritance the first lien on the income was for the maintenance of the  traditional sacrifices unless some special arrangement had been made.  These exceptional inheritances, without the deduction for sacrifices,  were naturally desired above all others and the phrase \"an inheritance  without sacrifices\" (_hereditas sine sacris_) became by degrees the  popular expression for a godsend. The other fact of interest in this  connection is that, inasmuch as ancestors were worshipped only _en  masse_ and not as individuals, that process could not take place in  Roman religion which is so familiar in many other religions, namely that  the great gods of the state should some of them have been originally  ancestors whose greatness during life had produced a corresponding  emphasis in their worship after death, so that ultimately they were  promoted from the ranks of the deified dead into the select Olympus of  individual gods. This has been a favourite theory of the making of a god  from the time of Euhemerus down to Herbert Spencer. There are religions  in which it is true for certain of the major gods, but there are no  traces of the process in Roman religion, and the reason is obvious in  view of the peculiar character of ancestor worship in Rome.    We have now seen the principal elements which went to make up the family  religion and that part of the state religion which was an enlargement  and an imitation of the family religion. But even in the most primitive  times a Roman's life was not bounded by his own hut and the phenomenon  of death. There was work to be done in life, a living to be gained, and  here, as everywhere, there were hosts of unseen powers who must be  propitiated. His religion was not only coincident with every phase of  private life, it was also closely related to the specific occupations  and interests of the people, and just as the interests of the community,  its means of livelihood, were agriculture and stock-raising, so the gods  were those of the crops and the herds. Some years ago the late Professor  Mommsen succeeded in extracting from the existing stone calendars a list  of the religious festivals of the old Roman year, and also in proving  that this list of festivals was complete in its present condition at a  time before the city of Rome was surrounded by the wall which Servius  Tullius built, and that it therefore goes back to the old kingdom, the  time of what has been called the \"Religion of Numa.\" We cannot go  through all the festivals in detail, but it is extremely interesting to  notice that almost every one of them is connected with the life of the  farmer and represents the action of propitiation towards some god or  group of gods at every time in the Roman year which was at all critical  for agricultural interests.    It must not be forgotten also that this list is not absolutely complete,  because it represents merely the official state festivals, and not even  all of them but only those which fell upon the same day or days every  year, so that they could be engraved in the stone to form a perpetual  calendar. All state festivals, of which there were several, which were  appointed in each particular year according to the backward or forward  estate of the harvest, were omitted from the list, though they were  celebrated at some time in every year; and naturally the public  calendars contained no reference to the many private and semi-private  ceremonies of the year, with which the state had nothing official to do,  festivals of the family and the clan, and even local festivals of  various districts of the city.    In this list of peaceful deities of the farm there is one god whose  character has been very much misunderstood because of the company which  he keeps; this is the god Mars. It has become the fashion of late to  consider him as a god of vegetation, and a great many ingenious  arguments have been brought forward to show his agricultural character.  But the more primitive a community is, the more intense is its struggle  for existence, and the more rife its rivalries with its neighbours.
