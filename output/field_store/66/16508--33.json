Marijuana is the dried leaves of the cannabis or hemp plant (Cannabis sativa).    Narcotics are drugs that relieve pain, often induce sleep, and refer to opium,  opium derivatives, and synthetic substitutes. Natural narcotics include opium  (paregoric, parepectolin), morphine (MS-Contin, Roxanol), codeine (Tylenol with  codeine, Empirin with codeine, Robitussan AC), and thebaine. Semisynthetic  narcotics include heroin (horse, smack), and hydromorphone (Dilaudid). Synthetic  narcotics include meperidine or Pethidine (Demerol, Mepergan), methadone  (Dolophine, Methadose), and others (Darvon, Lomotil).    Opium is the milky exudate of the incised, unripe seedpod of the opium poppy.    Opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) is the source for many natural and  semisynthetic narcotics.    Poppy straw concentrate is the alkaloid derived from the mature dried opium  poppy.    Qat (kat, khat) is a stimulant from the buds or leaves of catha edulis that is  chewed or drunk as tea.    Stimulants are drugs that relieve mild depression, increase energy and activity,  and include cocaine (coke, snow, crack), amphetamines (Desoxyn, Dexedrine),  phenmetrazine (Preludin), methylphenidate (Ritalin), and others (Cylert,  Sanorex, Tenuate).    Infant mortality rate: The number of deaths to infants under one year old in a  given year per l,000 live births occurring in the same year.    International disputes: This category includes a wide variety of situations that  range from traditional bilateral boundary disputes to unilateral claims of one  sort or another. Information regarding disputes over international boundaries  and maritime boundaries has been reviewed by the Department of State. References  to other situations involving borders or frontiers may also be included, such as  resource disputes, geopolitical questions, or irredentist issues. However,  inclusion does not necessarily constitute official acceptance or recognition by  the US Government.    Irrigated land: The figure refers to the land area that is artificially supplied  with water.    Land use: Human use of the land surface is categorized as arable land--land  cultivated for crops that are replanted after each harvest (wheat, maize, rice);  permanent crops--land cultivated for crops that are not replanted after each  harvest (citrus, coffee, rubber);  meadows and pastures--land permanently used  for herbaceous forage crops; forest and woodland--under dense or open stands of  trees; and other--any land type not specifically mentioned above (urban areas,  roads, desert).    Leaders: The chief of state is the titular leader of the country who represents  the state at official and ceremonial functions but is not involved with the day-  to-day activities of the government. The head of government is the  administrative leader who manages the day-to-day activities of the government.  In the UK, the monarch is the chief of state, and the Prime Minister is the head  of government. In the US, the President is both the chief of state and the head  of government.    Life expectancy at birth: The average number of years to be lived by a group of  people all born in the same year, if mortality at each age remains constant in  the future.    Literacy: There are no universal definitions and standards of literacy. Unless  otherwise noted, all rates are based on the most common definition--the ability  to read and write at a specified age. Detailing the standards that individual  countries use to assess the ability to read and write is beyond the scope of  this publication.    Maritime claims: The proximity of neighboring states may prevent some national  claims from being extended the full distance.    Merchant marine: All ships engaged in the carriage of goods. All commercial  vessels (as opposed to all nonmilitary ships), which excludes tugs, fishing  vessels, offshore oil rigs, etc.; also, a grouping of merchant ships by  nationality or register.    Captive register--A register of ships maintained by a territory, possession, or  colony primarily or exclusively for the use of ships owned in the parent  country; also referred to as an offshore register, the offshore equivalent of an  internal register. Ships on a captive register will fly the same flag as the  parent country, or a local variant of it, but will be subject to the maritime  laws and taxation rules of the offshore territory. Although the nature of a  captive register makes it especially desirable for ships owned in the parent  country, just as in the internal register, the ships may also be owned abroad.  The captive register then acts as a flag of convenience register, except that it  is not the register of an independent state.    Flag of convenience register--A national register offering registration to a  merchant ship not owned in the flag state. The major flags of convenience (FOC)  attract ships to their register by virtue of low fees, low or nonexistent  taxation of profits, and liberal manning requirements. True FOC registers are  characterized by having relatively few of the ships registered actually owned in  the flag state. Thus, while virtually any flag can be used for ships under a  given set of circumstances, an FOC register is one where the majority of the  merchant fleet is owned abroad. It is also referred to as an open register.    Flag state--The nation in which a ship is registered and which holds legal  jurisdiction over operation of the ship, whether at home or abroad. Differences  in flag state maritime legislation determine how a ship is manned and taxed and  whether a foreign-owned ship may be placed on the register.    Internal register--A register of ships maintained as a subset of a national  register. Ships on the internal register fly the national flag and have that  nationality but are subject to a separate set of maritime rules from those on  the main national register. These differences usually include lower taxation of  profits, manning by foreign nationals, and, usually, ownership outside the flag  state (when it functions as an FOC register). The Norwegian International Ship  Register and Danish International Ship Register are the most notable examples of  an internal register. Both have been instrumental in stemming flight from the  national flag to flags of convenience and in attracting foreign owned ships to  the Norwegian and Danish flags.    Merchant ship--A vessel that carries goods against payment of freight; commonly  used to denote any nonmilitary ship but accurately restricted to commercial  vessels only.    Register--The record of a ship's ownership and nationality as listed with the  maritime authorities of a country; also, the compendium of such individual  ships' registrations. Registration of a ship provides it with a nationality and  makes it subject to the laws of the country in which registered (the flag state)  regardless of the nationality of the ship's ultimate owner.    Money figures: All money figures are expressed in contemporaneous US dollars  unless otherwise indicated.    National product: The total output of goods and services in a country in a given  year. See Gross domestic product (GDP), Gross national product (GNP), and  GNP/GDP methodology.    Net migration rate: The balance between the number of persons entering and  leaving a country during the year per 1,000 persons (based on midyear  population). An excess of persons entering the country is referred to as net  immigration (3.56 migrants/1,000 population); an excess of persons leaving the  country as net emigration (-9.26 migrants/1,000 population).    Population: Figures are estimates from the Bureau of the Census based on  statistics from population censuses, vital statistics registration systems, or  sample surveys pertaining to the recent past, and on assumptions about future  trends. Starting with the 1993 Factbook demographic estimates for some countries  (mostly African) have taken into account the effects of the growing incidence of  AIDS infections; in 1993 these countries were Burkina, Burundi, Central African  Republic, Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Haiti, Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda,  Zaire, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Thailand, and Brazil.    Total fertility rate: The average number of children that would be born per  woman if all women lived to the end of their childbearing years and bore  children according to a given fertility rate at each age.    Years: All year references are for the calendar year (CY) unless indicated as  fiscal year (FY).

Lastly the owl is to be mentioned as belonging to the death-god,  which, strange to say, is represented nowhere in the pictures  realistically and so that it can be recognized, although other mythologic  animals, as the dog or the moan bird, occur plainly as animals in the  pictures. On the other hand, the owl's head appears on a human body in  the Dresden manuscript as a substitute for the death-deity itself, for  example on Dr. 18c, 19c, 20a and 20c and elsewhere, and forms a  regular attendant hieroglyph of the death-god in the group of three signs  already mentioned (Fig. 5).    Among the antiquities from the Maya region of Central America, there are  many objects and representations, which have reference to the cultus of  the death-god, and show resemblances to the pictures of the manuscripts.  The death-god also plays a role, even today, in the popular superstitions  of the natives of Yucatan, as a kind of spectre that prowls around the  houses of the sick. His name is Yum Cimil, the lord of death.      B. The God With the Large Nose and Lolling Tongue.    [Illustration: Figs. 7-10]    The deity, represented most frequently in all the manuscripts, is a  figure with a long, proboscis-like, pendent nose and a tongue (or teeth,  fangs) hanging out in front and at the sides of the mouth, also with a  characteristic head ornament resembling a knotted bow and with a peculiar  rim to the eye. Fig. 7 is the hieroglyph of this deity. In Codex  Tro.-Cortesianus it usually has the form of Fig. 8.    God B is evidently one of the most important of the Maya pantheon. He  must be a universal deity, to whom the most varied elements, natural  phenomena and activities are subject. He is represented with different  attributes and symbols of power, with torches in his hands as symbols of  fire, sitting in the water and on the water, standing in the rain, riding  in a canoe, enthroned on the clouds of heaven and on the cross-shaped  tree of the four points of the compass, which, on account of its likeness  to the Christian emblem, has many times been the subject of fantastic  hypotheses. We see the god again on the Cab-sign, the symbol of the  earth, with weapons, axe and spears, in his hands, planting kernels of  maize, on a journey (Dr. 65b) staff in hand and a bundle on his back,  and fettered (Dr. 37a) with arms bound behind his back. His entire myth  seems to be recorded in the manuscripts. The great abundance of symbolism  renders difficult the characterization of the deity, and it is well-nigh  impossible to discover that a single mythologic idea underlies the whole.  God B is quite often connected with the serpent, without exhibiting  affinity with the Chicchan-god H (see p. 28). In Dr. 33b, 34b and 35b,  the serpent is in the act of devouring him, or he is rising up out of the  serpent's jaws, as is plainly indicated also by the hieroglyphs, for they  contain the group given in Fig. 10, which is composed of the rattle of  the rattlesnake and the opened hand as a symbol of seizing and  absorption. God B himself is pictured with the body of a serpent in Dr.  35b and 36a (compare No. 2 of the Mythological Animals). He likewise  occurs sitting on the serpent and in Dr. 66a he is twice (1st and 3d  figures) pictured with a snake in his hand.    God B sits on the moan head in Dr. 38c, on a head with the Cauac-sign in  Dr. 39c, 66c, and on the dog in Dr. 29a. All these pictures are meant  to typify his abode in the air, above rain, storm and death-bringing  clouds, from which the lightning falls. The object with the cross-bones  of the death-god, on which he sits in Dr. 66c, can perhaps be explained  in the same manner. As the fish belongs to god B in a symbolic sense, so  the god is represented fishing in Dr. 44 (1). His face with the large  nose and the tongue (or fangs) hanging out on the side in Dr. 44 (1)a  (1st figure) is supposed to be a mask which the priest, representing the  god, assumes during the religious ceremony.    Furthermore the following four well-known symbols of sacrificial gifts  appear in connection with god B in the Dresden manuscript; a sprouting  kernel of maize (or, according to Foerstemann, parts of a mammal, game), a  fish, a lizard and a vulture's head, as symbols of the four elements.  They seem to occur, however, in relation also to other deities and  evidently are general symbols of sacrificial gifts. Thus they occur on  the two companion initial pages of the Codex Tro.-Cortesianus, on which  the hieroglyphs of gods C and K are repeated in rows (Tro. 36-Cort. 22.  Compare Foerstemann, Kommentar zur Madrider Handschrift, pp. 102, 103).  God B is also connected with the four colors--yellow, red, white and  black--which, according to the conception of the Mayas, correspond to the  cardinal points (yellow, air; red, fire; white, water; black, earth) and  the god himself is occasionally represented with a black body, for  example on Dr. 29c, 31c and 69. This is expressed in the hieroglyphs by  the sign, Fig. 9, which signifies black and is one of the four signs of  the symbolic colors for the cardinal points.    God B is represented with all the _four cardinal points_, a  characteristic, which he shares only with god C, god K, and, in one  instance, with god F (see Tro. 29*c); he appears as ruler of all the  points of the compass; north, south, east and west as well as air, fire,  water and earth are subject to him.    Opinions concerning the significance of this deity are much divided. It  is most probable that he is Kukulcan, a figure occurring repeatedly in  the mythology of the Central American peoples and whose name, like that  of the kindred deity Quetzalcoatl among the Aztecs and Gucumatz among the  Quiches, means the \"feathered serpent\", \"the bird serpent\". Kukulcan and  Gucumatz are those figures of Central American mythology, to which belong  the legends of the creation of the world and of mankind. Furthermore  Kukulcan is considered as the founder of civilization, as the builder of  cities, as hero-god, and appears in another conception as the rain-deity,  and--since the serpent has a mythologic relation to water--as serpent  deity. J. Walter Fewkes, who has made this god-figure of the Maya  manuscripts the subject of a monograph (A Study of Certain Figures in a  Maya Codex, in American Anthropologist, Vol. VII, No. 3, Washington,  1894), also inclines to the belief that B is the god Kukulcan, whom he  conceives of as a serpent-and rain-deity. This view has been accepted by  Foerstemann (Die Tagegoetter der Mayas, Globus, Vol. 73, No. 10) and also  by Cyrus Thomas (Aids to the Study of the Maya Codices, Washington,  1888). The same opinion is held also by E. P. Dieseldorff, who, a  resident of Guatemala, the region of the ancient Maya civilization, has  instituted excavations which have been successful in furnishing most  satisfactory material for these researches (see Dieseldorff: Kukulcan,  Zeitschrift fuer Ethnologie, 1895, p. 780). Others have considered god B  as the first parent and lord of the heavens, Itzamna who has a mythologic  importance analogous to that of Kukulcan. Itzamna is also held to be the  god of creation and founder of civilization and accordingly seems to be  not very remotely allied to the god Kukulcan. Others again, for example  Brasseur de Bourbourg and Seler, have interpreted the figure of god B to  represent the fourfold god of the cardinal points and rain-god Chac, a  counterpart of the Aztec rain-god Tlaloc. The fact that this god-figure  is so frequently connected with the serpent and the bird is strongly in  favor of the correctness of the supposition, that we should see in god B  a figure corresponding to the Kukulcan of tradition. Thus we see the god  represented once with the body of a serpent and with a bird near by  (Cort. 10b), while B's hieroglyph appears both times in the text. God B  is also pictured elsewhere repeatedly with a serpent body, thus for  example on Dr. 35b, 36a. On pages 4-6 of the Codex Cortesianus he is  pictured six times and each time in connection with a serpent.    The accounts we have received concerning the mythology of the Maya  peoples are very meagre and owing to the uncertainty respecting the  origin of the Maya manuscripts, it cannot even be determined which of  these accounts are applicable to the Maya manuscripts, or, indeed,  whether they are applicable at all. For it is by no means positively  proved that these manuscripts did not originate in regions of Maya  culture, regarding which we have received no accounts at all. As our  present purpose is purely that of description and determination, it  remains quite unimportant which of these recorded figures of gods shall  be regarded as god B.    God B is nearly allied to, but in no wise identical with, the deity with  the large ornamented nose, designated by K, who will be discussed farther  on. God K is an independent deity designated by a special hieroglyph, but  like C he stands in an unknown relation to God B (for details see K).    Finally it should be mentioned, that god B never appears with death  symbols. He is clearly a deity of life and creation, in contrast to the  powers of death and destruction.    His day seems to be Ik (aspiration, breath, life). (Compare Foerstemann,  Die Tagegoetter der Mayas, Globus, Vol. 73, No. 10).      C. The God with the Ornamented Face.    [Illustration: Figs. 11-16]    This is one of the most remarkable and most difficult figures of the Maya  manuscripts, and shows, at the same time, how imperfect must be the  information we have received in regard to the Maya mythology, since from  the frequency of his representations he is"]]]
