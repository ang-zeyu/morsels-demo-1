There appears to be no significant difference in the measurements and  weights of males and females, with the possible exception of the  comparison of adult males and adult nonpregnant females.          OCCURRENCE.      GENERAL DISTRIBUTION.    _Dipodomys spectabilis spectabilis_ is found in southeastern Arizona, in  northwestern, central, and southern New Mexico, in extreme western  Texas, in northern Sonora, and in northern and central Chihuahua (Fig.  1). A subspecies, _D. s. cratodon_ Merriam, has been described from  Chicalote, Aguas Calientes, Mexico, the geographic range of which lies  in central Mexico in portions of the States of Zacatecas, San Luis  Potosi, and Aguas Calientes.      HABITAT.    In the Tucson region _spectabilis_ is typically a resident of the Lower  Sonoran Zone. This is perhaps the principal zone inhabited over its  entire range, but the animal is often found in the Upper Sonoran also,  and in the Gallina Mountains of New Mexico Hollister found it invading  the yellow pine Transition where the soil was dry and sandy and the pine  woods of open character. The same observer found it common in grassy and  weed-grown parks among the large junipers, pinyons, and scattering  yellow pines of the Bear Spring Mountains, N. Mex. Bailey calls  attention to the fact that the animal apparently does not inhabit the  lower half of the Lower Sonoran Zone, as it extends neither into the Rio  Grande Valley of Texas nor the Gila Valley of Arizona. In extreme  western Texas it is common at the upper edge of the arid Lower Sonoran  Zone, and in this region does not enter the Upper Sonoran to any extent.    In July, 1914, Goldman found this kangaroo rat common on the plain at  4,600 feet altitude, near Bonita, Graham County, Ariz., and noted a few  as high as 5,000 feet altitude on the warm southwestern slopes of the  Graham Mountains, near Fort Grant. Apparently _spectabilis_ reaches its  upper altitude limit in the Burro Mountains, N. Mex., where Bailey has  found it sparingly on warm slopes up to 5,700 feet, and at the western  base of the Sandia Mountains, east of Albuquerque, N. Mex., where dens  occur at approximately 6,000 feet.    About Tucson it is undoubtedly more common in the somewhat higher  portions of the Lower Sonoran Zone, above the _Covillea_ association,  than elsewhere (Pl. IV, Figs. 1 and 2). A few scattered dens are to be  seen in the _Covillea_ belt, but as one rises to altitudes of 3,500 to  4,000 feet, and the _Covillea_ is replaced by the cat's-claws (_Acacia_  sp. and _Mimosa_ sp.) and scattered mesquite (_Prosopis_), with the  _Opuntia_ becoming less abundant, kangaroo rat mounds come more and more  in evidence. Here is to be found the principal grass growth supporting  the grazing industry, and the presence of a more luxuriant grass flora  is probably an important factor in the greater abundance of kangaroo  rats, both _spectabilis_ and _merriami_. In this generally preferred  environment the desert hackberry (_Celtis pallida_) is one of the most  conspicuous shrubs; clumps of this species are commonly accompanied by  kangaroo rat mounds.    In order to ascertain whether the banner-tailed kangaroo rat has any  marked preference for building its mounds under _Celtis_ or some other  particular plant, all the observable mounds were counted in a strip  about 20 rods wide and approximately 4 miles long, an area of  approximately 160 acres, particular note being taken of the kind of  shrub under which each mound was located. Of 300 mounds in this area, 96  were under _Prosopis_, 95 under _Acacia_, 65 under _Celtis_, 11 under  _Lycium_, 31 in the open, 1 about a \"cholla\" cactus (_Opuntia  spinosior_), and 1 about a prickly pear (_Opuntia_ sp.). There is  apparently no strongly marked preference for any single species of  plant. While both desert hackberry and the cat's-claws afford a  better protection than mesquite--since cattle more often seek shade  under the latter, and in so doing frequently trample the mounds  severely--it appears that the general protection of a tree or shrub of  some sort is sought by kangaroo rats, rather than the specific  protection of the thickest or thorniest species.    The following records indicate particular habitat preferences of  _spectabilis_ as noted at different points in its range:         Occurs on open bare knolls exposed to winds, also on gravelly       places at lower edge of foothills (Franklin Mountains, Tex., Gaut);       here and there over the barest and hardest of the gravelly mesas       (Bailey, Tex., 1905, 147); on open creosote-bush and giant-cactus       desert (Tucson, Ariz., Vorhies and Taylor); on firm, gravelly, or       even rocky soil on the grassy bajada land along the northwest base       of the mountains, either in the open or under _Celtis_, _Prosopis_,       _Lycium_, _Acacia greggii_, or other brush (Santa Rita Mountains,       Ariz., Vorhies and Taylor); mounds usually thrown up around a bunch       of cactus or mesquite brush (Magdalena, Sonora, Bailey); in heavy       soil (Ajo, Ariz., A. B. Howell); loamy soil (Gunsight, Ariz., A. B.       Howell); in mesa where not too stony (Magdalena, Sonora, Bailey);       grassy plain (Gallego, Chihuahua, Nelson); in open valley and high       open plains (Santa Rosa, N. Mex., Bailey); in grassy and weed-grown       parks among the larger junipers, pinyons, and scattering yellow       pines (Bear Spring Mountains, N. Mex., Hollister); on sand-dune       strip (east side of Pecos River, 15 miles northeast of Roswell, N.       Mex., Bailey); among _Ephedra_ patches (San Juan Valley, N. Mex.,       Birdseye); in open sandy soil along dry wash (Rio Alamosa, N. Mex.,       Goldman); on sides and crests of bare, stony hills (Mesa Jumanes,       N. Mex., Gaut); in open, arid part of the valley and stony mesas       (Carlsbad and Pecos Valley, N. Mex., Bailey); about the edges of       the plains of San Augustine and the foothills of the Datil and       Gallina Mountains, and in the Transition Zone yellow-pine forest of       the Gallina Mountains (Datil region, N. Mex., Hollister); on hard       limy ridges (Monahans, Tex., Cary).    A. Brazier Howell notes that _spectabilis_ occurs in harder soil than  does _deserti_. This observation is confirmed by others, and seems to  afford a conspicuous habitat difference between the two, for _deserti_  is typically an animal of the shifting aeolian sands.    Usually, as on the Range Reserve, the rodents are widely distributed  over a considerable area. Occasionally, as in the vicinity of Rio  Alamosa, N. Mex., as reported by Goldman, they occur only in small  colonies.      [Illustration: PLATE IV. FIG. 1.--RANGE CONDITIONS FAVORING KANGAROO RATS.

FIG. 2.--RANGE CONDITIONS LESS FAVORABLE TO  KANGAROO RATS.    View on lower portion of Range Reserve, where _Dipodomys s. spectabilis_  is less abundant. Vegetation consists principally of _Lycium_, mesquite,  rabbit brush, and cactus, there being very little grass.]          HABITS.      EVIDENCE OF PRESENCE.      MOUNDS.    One traveling over territory thickly occupied by the banner-tailed  kangaroo rat is certain to note the numerous and conspicuous mounds so  characteristic of the species, particularly if the region is of the  savannah type, grassy rather than brushy. These low, rounded mounds  occupy an area of several feet in diameter, and rise to varying heights  above the general surface of the surrounding soil, the height depending  rather more upon the character of the soil and the location of the mound  as to exposure or protection than upon the area occupied by the burrow  system which lies within and is the reason for the mound.    A den in sandy soil in the open may be of maximum size in area occupied  and yet scarcely present the appearance of a mound in any sense, due  probably both to the fact that the sandy soil will not heap up to such a  height over a honeycomb of tunnels as will a firmer or rocky soil, and  also to its greater exposure to the leveling action of rains and the  trampling of animals. These mounds are in themselves large enough to  attract some attention, but their conspicuousness is enhanced by the  fact that they are more or less completely denuded of vegetation and are  the centers of cleared areas often as much as 30 feet in diameter (Pl.  V, Fig. 1); and further that from 3 to 12 large dark openings loom up in  every mound. The larger openings are of such size as to suggest the  presence of a much larger animal than actually inhabits the mound. Add  to the above the fact that the traveler by day never sees the mound  builder, and we have the chief reasons why curiosity is so often aroused  by these habitations.    On the Range Reserve the mounds are usually rendered conspicuous by the  absence of small vegetation, but Nelson writes that in the vicinity of  Gallego, Chihuahua, they can be readily distinguished at a distance  because of a growth of weeds and small bushes over their summits, which  overtop the grass. In the vicinity of Albuquerque, N. Mex., Bailey  reports (and this was recently confirmed by Vorhies) that the mounds  about the holes of _spectabilis_ are often hardly noticeable. Hollister  writes that in the yellow-pine forests of the Gallina Mountains the  burrows are usually under the trunk of some fallen pine, both sides of  it in some cases being taken up with holes, there being some eight or  ten entrances along each side, the burrows extending into the ground  beneath the log. In the vicinity of Blanco, N. Mex., Birdseye says that  occasionally"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17987"],[0,"The Mound Builders (#3)"],[1,"weapons in time of war. In the mound on the Red River a skull was  discovered having a deep depression in the broken wall, as if crushed  in by one of these implements.    (_c_.) _Stone Tubes_. (See B Fig. 1.) These are among the most  difficult of all the mound-builders' remains to give an opinion upon.  They are chiefly made of a soft stone something like the pipestone  used by the present Indians which approaches soapstone. The hollow  tubes (see figure B.) vary from three to six inches in length, and are  about one-half an inch in diameter. They seem to have been bored out  by some sharp instrument. Schoolcraft, certainly a competent Indian  authority states that these tubes were employed for astronomical  purposes, that is to look at the stars. This is unlikely; for though  the race, with which I shall try to identify our mound builders are  said, in regions further south, to have left remains showing  astronomical knowledge, yet a more reasonable purpose is suggested for  the tubes. From the teeth marks around the rim, the tubes were plainly  used in the mouth, and it is becoming generally agreed that they were  conjuror's cupping instruments for sucking out as the medicine men  pretended to be able to do the disease from the body. The custom  survives in some of the present Indian tribes. A lady friend of mine  informs me that she has a bone whistle taken from a mound in the Red  River district.    2. _Horn Implements_. (See D. Figure 1.) The only implement of this  class that we have yet found is the fish spear head (Fig. D.). It was  probably made from the antlers of a deer killed in the chase. Its  barbed edge indicates that it was used for spearing fish. It is in a  fair state of preservation.    3. _Copper_. No discovery of the mounds so fills the mind of the  Archaeologist with joy as that of copper implements. Copper mining has  now by the discovery in the Lake Superior region, of mining shafts  long deserted, in which copper was quarried by stone hammers on a  large scale, been shown to have been pursued in very ancient times on  this continent. It is of intense interest for us to know that not only  are there mines found on the south side of Lake Superior, but also at  Isle Royale, on the north side just at the opening of Thunder Bay, and  immediately contiguous to the Grand Portage, where the canoe route to  Rainy River, so late as our own century, started from Lake Superior.  According to the American Geologists the traces for a mile are found  of an old copper mine on this Island. One of the pits opened showed  that the excavation had been made in the solid rock to the depth of  nine feet, the walls being perfectly smooth. A vein of native copper  eighteen inches thick was discovered at the bottom. Here is found  also, unless I am much mistaken, the mining location whence the  Takawgamis of Rainy River obtained their copper implements. Two copper  implements are in our possession, one found by Mr. E. McColl in the  grand mound, and the other by Mr. Alexander Baker in a small mound  adjoining this.    (_a_.) _Copper Needle or Drill_. (See A. Fig. 1.) This was plainly  used for some piercing or boring purpose. It is hard, yields with  difficulty to the knife, and is considered by some to have been  tempered. It may have been for drilling out soft stone implements, or  was probably used for piercing as a needle soft fabrics of bark and  the like, which were being sewed together.    (_b_.) _Copper Cutting Knife_. (See E. Fig. 1.) This, has evidently  been fastened into a wooden handle. It may have been used for cutting  leather, being in the shape of a saddler's knife, or was perhaps more  suited for scraping the hides and skins of animals being prepared for  use.    Some twenty miles above the mound on the Rainy River at Fort Frances a  copper chisel buried in the earth was found by Mr. Pither, then H. B.  Company agent, and was given by him to the late Governor McTavish. The  chisel was ten inches long, was well tempered, and was a good cutting  instrument. Another copper implement is in the possession of our  Society, which was found buried in the earth 100 miles west of Red  River.    All these, I take it, were made from copper obtained from Isle Royale  on Lake Superior.    4. _Shell Ornaments_. Traces are found in the mound, of the fact that  the decorative taste, no doubt developed in all ages, and in all  climes, was possessed by the Takawgamis.    (_a_.) _Sea Shells_. Important as pointing to the home and trading  centres of the mound builders is the presence among the debris of the  mound, of sea shells. We have three specimens found in the grand  mound. Two of them seem to belong to the genus Natica, the other to  Marginella. They have all been cut or ground down on the side of the  opening of the shell, so that two holes permit the passage of a  string, by which the beads thus made are strung together. The fact  that the genera to which the shells belong are found in the sea, as  well as their highly polished surface show these to be marine; and not  only so but from the tropical seas, either we suppose from the Gulf of  Mexico or from the Californian coast.    (_b_.) _Fresh Water Shells_. In all the mounds yet opened, examples of  the Unio, or River Mussel, commonly known as the clam have been found.  They are usually polished, cut into symmetrical shapes, and have holes  bored in them. We have one which was no doubt used as a breast  ornament, and was hung by a string around the neck. In the bottom of a  nearly complete pottery cup, found in the grand mound, which went to  pieces as we took it out, there was lying a polished clam shell. The  clam still abounds on Rainy River. Six miles above the mound, we saw  gathered together by an industrious housewife hundreds of the same  species of clam, whose shells she was in the habit of pulverizing for  the benefit of her poultry.    5. _Pottery_. (_a_.) _Broken_. It seems to be a feature of every mound  that has been opened that fragments of pottery have been unearthed.  The Society has in its possession remains of twenty or thirty pottery  vessels. They are shown to be portions of different pots, by their  variety of marking. The pottery is of a coarse sort, seemingly made by  hand and not upon a wheel, and then baked. The markings were made upon  the soft clay, evidently with a sharp instrument, or sometimes with  the finger nail. Some pieces are found hard and well preserved; others  are rapidly disintegrating. As stated already, in the grand mound, a  vessel some five inches in diameter was dug up by one of the workers,  filled with earth, which though we tried earnestly to save it, yet  went to pieces in our hands. The frequency with which fragments of  pottery are found in the mounds has given rise to the theory that  being used at the time of the funeral rites the vessel was dashed to  pieces as was done by some ancient nations in the burial of the dead.  This theory is made very doubtful indeed by the discovery of the    [Illustration: FIGURE 2.]    (_b_.) _Complete Pottery Cup_. So far as I know this is the only  complete cup now in existence in the region northwest of Lake  Superior, though several others are said to have been discovered and  been sent to distant friends of the finders. This cup, belonging now  to the Historical Society was found in the grand mound, in company  with charred bones, skulls, and other human bones, lumps of red ochre,  and the shells just described. The dimensions of the cup are as  follows:         Mean diameter at top of rim          2.09 inches.       Greatest mean diameter               3.03   \"       Height                               2.49   \"       Thickness of material                0.092  \"       Weight                               ---- oz.    Whether the cup was intended for use as a burial urn, or simply for  ordinary use it is difficult to say.    Now, in endeavoring to sum up the results a few points need some  discussion.    1. Who were the people who erected the mounds? Judging from the  following considerations, I should say they were    NOT AN INDIAN RACE.    Whoever built the mounds had a faculty not possessed by modern  Indians. Building instincts seem hereditary. The beaver and the musk  rat build a house. Other creatures to whom a dwelling might be  serviceable, such as the squirrel, obtain shelter in another way. And  races have their distinctive tendencies likewise. It never occurs to  an Indian to build a mound. From what has been already said as to the  fertile localities in which the mounds are found we are justified in  believing that their builders were agriculturists. Dr. Dawson in  Montreal by the use of the microscope detected grains of charred corn  in the remains of Hochelaga. I have examined a small quantity of the  dust taken from one of the shells found in the grand mound, with the  microscope, and though I am not perfectly certain, yet I believe there  are traces of some farinaceous substance to be seen. On skirting the  shores of the Lake of the Woods into which Rainy River runs, at the  present time, you are struck by the fact that there are no Canadian  farmers there, and likewise that there are no mounds to be seen, while  along the banks of Rainy River both the agriculturist is found  cultivating the soil and the mounds abound. It would seem to justify  us in concluding that the farmer and the mound builder avoided the one  locality because of its barren rocky character, and took to the other  because of its fertility. Moreover the continual occurrence of pottery  in the mounds shows that the mound builders were potters as well,  while none of the tribes inhabiting the district have any knowledge of  the art of pottery. The making of pottery is the occupation peculiarly  of a sedentary race, and hence of a race likely to be agriculturists.  As it requires the building faculty to originate the mounds, so it  requires the constructive faculty"]]]
