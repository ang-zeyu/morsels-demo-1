Yes, sir; there was a United States Supervisor of Elections, two of  them.    By JUDGE SELDEN:    Q. Did they advise the registry, or did they not?    A. One of them did.    Q. And on that advice the registry was made with the judgment of the  inspectors.    A. It had a great deal of weight with the inspectors, I have no doubt.    _Re-direct Examination by_ MR. CROWLEY:    Q. Was Miss Anthony challenged before the Board of Registry?    A. Not at the time she offered her name.    Q. Was she challenged at any time?    A. Yes, sir; the second day of the meeting of the Board.    Q. Was the preliminary and the general oath administered?    A. Yes, sir.    Q. Won't you state what Miss Anthony said, if she said anything, when  she came there and offered her name for registration?    A. She stated that she did not claim any rights under the constitution  of the State of New York; she claimed her right under the constitution  of the United States.    Q. Did she name any particular amendment?    A. Yes, sir; she cited the 14th amendment.    Q. Under that she claimed her right to vote?    A. Yes, sir.    Q. Did the other Federal Supervisor who was present, state it as his  opinion that she was entitled to vote under that amendment, or did he  protest, claiming that she did not have the right to vote?    A. One of them said that there was no way for the inspectors to get  around placing the name upon the register; the other one, when she came  in, left the room.    Q. Did this one who said that there was no way to get around placing the  name upon the register, state that she had her right to register but did  not have the right to vote?    A. I didn't hear him make any such statement.    Q. You didn't hear any such statement as that?    A. No, sir.    Q. Was there a poll list kept of the voters of the first election  district of the 8th ward on the day of election?    A. Yes, sir.    Q. (Handing witness two books.) State whether that is the poll list of  voters kept upon the day of election in the first election district of  the 8th ward, of the city of Rochester?    A. This is the poll list, and also the register.    Q. Turn to the name of Susan B. Anthony, if it is upon that poll list?    A. I have it.    Q. What number is it?    A. Number 22.    Q. From that poll list what tickets does it purport to show that she  voted upon that occasion?    A. Electoral, State, Congress and Assembly.    _United States rests._      JUDGE SELDEN opened the case in behalf of the defendant, as follows:    _If the Court please, Gentlemen of the Jury_:    This is a case of no ordinary magnitude, although many might regard it  as one of very little importance. The question whether my client here  has done anything to justify her being consigned to a felon's prison or  not, is one that interests her very essentially, and that interests the  people also essentially. I claim and shall endeavor to establish before  you that when she offered to have her name registered as a voter, and  when she offered her vote for Member of Congress, she was as much  entitled to vote as any man that voted at that election, according to  the Constitution and laws of the Government under which she lives. If I  maintain that proposition, as a matter of course she has committed no  offence, and is entitled to be discharged at your hands.    But, beyond that, whether she was a legal voter or not, whether she was  entitled to vote or not, if she sincerely believed that she had a right  to vote, and offered her ballot in good faith, under that belief,  whether right or wrong, by the laws of this country she is guilty of no  crime. I apprehend that that proposition, when it is discussed, will be  maintained with a clearness and force that shall leave no doubt upon the  mind of the Court or upon your minds as the gentlemen of the jury. If I  maintain that proposition here, then the further question and the only  question which, in my judgment, can come before you to be passed upon by  you as a question of fact is whether or not she did vote in good faith,  believing that she had a right to vote.    The public prosecutor assumes that, however honestly she may have  offered her vote, however sincerely she may have believed that she had a  right to vote, if she was mistaken in that judgment, her offering her  vote and its being received makes a criminal offence--a proposition to  me most abhorrent, as I believe it will be equally abhorrent to your  judgment.    Before the registration, and before this election, Miss Anthony called  upon me for advice upon the question whether, under the 14th Amendment  of the Constitution of the United States, she had a right to vote. I had  not examined the question. I told her I would examine it and give her my  opinion upon the question of her legal right. She went away and came  again after I had made the examination. I advised her that she was as  lawful a voter as I am, or as any other man is, and advised her to go  and offer her vote. I may have been mistaken in that, and if I was  mistaken, I believe she acted in good faith. I believe she acted  according to her right as the law and Constitution gave it to her. But  whether she did or not, she acted in the most perfect good faith, and if  she made a mistake, or if I made one, that is not a reason for  committing her to a felon's cell.    For the second time in my life, in my professional practice, I am under  the necessity of offering myself as a witness for my client.    HENRY R. SELDEN, a witness sworn in behalf of the defendant, testified  as follows:    Before the last election, Miss Anthony called upon me for advice, upon  the question whether she was or was not a legal voter. I examined the  question, and gave her my opinion, unhesitatingly, that the laws and  Constitution of the United States, authorized her to vote, as well as  they authorize any man to vote; and I advised her to have her name  placed upon the registry and to vote at the election, if the inspectors  should receive her vote. I gave the advice in good faith, believing it  to be accurate, and I believe it to be accurate still.    [This witness was not cross-examined.]      JUDGE SELDEN: I propose to call Miss Anthony as to the fact of her  voting--on the question of the intention or belief under which she  voted.    MR. CROWLEY: She is not competent as a witness in her own behalf.    [The Court so held.]    _Defendant rests._      JOHN E. POUND, a witness sworn in behalf of the United States, testified  as follows:    _Examined by_ MR. CROWLEY.    Q. During the months of November and December, 1872, and January, 1873,  were you Assistant United States Dist. Attorney for the Northern  District of New York?    A. Yes, sir.    Q. Do you know the defendant, Susan B. Anthony?    A. Yes, sir.    Q. Did you attend an examination before Wm. C. Storrs, a United States  Commissioner, in the city of Rochester, when her case was examined?    A. I did    Q. Was she called as a witness in her own behalf upon that examination?    A. She was.    Q. Was she sworn?    A. She was.    Q. Did she give evidence?    A. She did.    Q. Did you keep minutes of evidence on that occasion?    A. I did.    Q. (Handing the witness a paper.) Please look at the paper now shown you  and see if it contains the minutes you kept upon that occasion?    A. It does.    Q. Turn to the evidence of Susan B. Anthony!    A. I have it.    Q. Did she, upon that occasion, state that she consulted or talked with  Judge Henry R. Selden, of Rochester, in relation to her right to vote?    JUDGE SELDEN: I object to that upon the ground that it is incompetent,  that if they refuse to allow her to be sworn here, they should be  excluded from producing any evidence that she gave elsewhere, especially  when they want to give the version which the United States officer took  of her evidence.    THE COURT: Go on.    By MR. CROWLEY:    Q. State whether she stated on that examination, under oath, that she  had talked or consulted with Judge Henry R. Selden in relation to her  right to vote?    A. She did.    Q. State whether she was asked, upon that examination, if the advice  given her by Judge Henry R. Selden would or did make any difference in  her action in voting, or in substance that?    A. She stated on the cross-examination, \"I should have made the same  endeavor to vote that I did had I not consulted Judge Selden. I didn't  consult any one before I registered. I was not influenced by his advice  in the matter at all; have been resolved to vote, the first time I was  at home 30 days, for a number of years.\"      _Cross-examination by_ MR. VAN VOORHEES:    Q. Mr. Pound, was she asked there if she had any doubt about her right  to vote, and did she answer \"Not a particle?\"    A. She stated \"Had no doubt as to my right to vote,\" on the direct  examination.    Q. There was a stenographic reporter there, was there not?    A. A reporter was there taking notes.    Q. Was not this question put to her \"Did you have any doubt yourself of  your right to vote?\" and did she not answer \"Not a particle?\"    THE COURT: Well, he says so, that she had no doubt of her right to vote.    JUDGE SELDEN: I beg leave to state, in regard to my own testimony, Miss  Anthony informs me that I was mistaken in the fact that my advice was  before her registry. It was my recollection that it was on her way to  the registry, but she states to me now that she was registered and came  immediately to my office. In that respect I was under a mistake.    _Evidence closed._          ARGUMENT OF MR. SELDEN FOR THE DEFENDANT.      The defendant is indicted under the 19th section of the Act of Congress  of May 31, 1870 (16 St. at L., 144,), for \"voting without having a  lawful right to vote.\"    The words of the Statute, so far as they are"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18284"],[0,"For Every Music Lover (#3)"],[1,"th, but had found no firm ground on  which to stand.    Much finer were the instincts of Capellmeister Wolfgang Kasper, Prince  of Waldthurn, whose historical treatise on Music appeared in Dresden in  1690. He boldly declared the author of music to be the good God himself,  who fashioned the air to transmit musical sounds, the ear to receive  them, the soul of man to throb with emotions demanding utterance, and  all nature to be filled with sources of inspiration. The good  Capellmeister was in close touch with the Truth.    It was in 1835, the same year that the French writer mentioned offered  his wild speculations, that Herbert Spencer, from the standpoint of a  scientist, produced his essay on the \"Origin and Function of Music,\"  which has proved invaluable in arousing discriminating thought in these  lines. Many years elapsed before its worth to musicians was realized.  To-day it is widely known and far-reaching in its influence.    In those inner agitations which cause muscular expansion and  contraction, and find expression in the inflections and cadences of the  voice, Herbert Spencer saw the foundations of music. He unhesitatingly  defined it as emotional speech, the language of the feelings, whose  function was to increase the sympathies and broaden the horizon of  mankind. Besides frankly placing music at the head of the fine arts, he  declared that those sensations of unexperienced felicity it arouses,  those impressions of an unknown, ideal existence it calls forth, may be  regarded as a prophecy to the fulfilment of which music is itself partly  instrumental. Our strange capacity for being affected by melody and  harmony cannot but imply that it is possible to realize the delights  they suggest. On these suppositions might be comprehended the power and  significance of music which must otherwise remain a mystery. The  progress of musical culture, he thought, could not be too much applauded  as a noble means of ministering to human welfare. Mr. Spencer's theory  has of late led to much controversy. Its author has been censured for  setting forth no explanation of the place of harmony in modern music,  and for not realizing what a musical composition is. In his last volume,  \"Facts and Comments,\" which contains many valuable thoughts not  previously published, he declares that his critics have obviously  confounded the origin of a thing and that which originates from it.  \"Here we have a striking example of the way in which an hypothesis is  made to appear untenable by representing it as being something which it  does not profess to be,\" he says. \"I gave an account of the origin of  music, and now I am blamed because my conception of the origin of music  does not include a conception of music as fully developed. If to some  one who said that an oak comes from an acorn it were replied that he had  manifestly never seen an oak, since an acorn contains no trace of all  its complexities of form and structure, the reply would not be thought a  rational one;\" but he believes it would be quite as rational as to  suppose he had not realized what a musical composition is because his  theory of the origin of music says nothing about the characteristics of  an overture or a quartet.    Of the music of primeval man we can form an estimate from the music of  still existing uncivilized races. As the vocabulary of their speech is  limited, so the notes of their music are few, but expressive gestures  and modulations of the voice supplement both. With advancing  civilization the emotions of which the human heart are capable become  more complex and demand larger means of expression. Some belief in the  healing, helpful, uplifting power of music has always prevailed. It  remains for independent, practical, modern man to present the art to the  world as a thing of law and order, whose ineffable beauty and  beneficence may reach the lives of the average man and woman.    Without the growth of the individual, music cannot grow; without freedom  of thought, neither the language of tones nor that of words can gain  full, free utterance. Freedom is essential to the life of the indwelling  spirit. Wherever the flow of thought and fancy is impeded, or the  energies of the individual held in check, there music is cramped. In  China, where conditions have crushed spiritual and intellectual liberty,  the art remains to this day in a crude rhythmical or percussion state,  although it was early honored as the gift of superior beings. The  Chinese philosopher detected a grand world music in the harmonious order  of the heavens and the earth, and wrote voluminous works on musical  theory. When it came to putting this into practice tones were combined  in a pedantic fashion.    In all ages and climes music has ministered to religion and education.  The sacred Vedas bear testimony to the high place it held in Hindu  worship and life. Proud records of stone reveal its dignified role in  the civilization of Egypt, where Plato stated there had existed ten  thousand years before his day music that could only have emanated from  gods or godlike men. The art was taught by the temple priests, and the  education of no young person was complete without a knowledge of it.    Egyptian musical culture impressed itself on the Greeks, and also on the  Israelites, whose tone-language gained warmth and coloring from various  Oriental sources. Hebrew scriptures abound in tributes to the worth of  music which was intimately related to the political life, mental  consciousness and national sentiment of the Children of Israel. Through  music they approached the unseen King of kings with the plaintive  outpourings of their grief-laden hearts and with their joyful hymns of  praise and thanksgiving.    From the polished Greeks we gained a basis for the scientific laws  governing our musical art. The splendid music of which we read in  ancient writings has for the most part vanished with the lives it  enriched. Relegated to the guardianship of exclusive classes its most  sacred secrets were kept from the people, and it could not possibly have  attained the expansion we know.    Music has been called the handmaiden of Christianity, but may more  appropriately be designated its loyal helpmeet. Whatever synagogue or  other melodies may have first served to voice the sentiments kindled by  the Gospel of Glad Tidings it was inevitable that the new religious  thought should seek and find new musical expression.    In shaping a ritual for general use, an accompaniment of suitable music  had to be considered. The fathers of the church constituted themselves  also the guides of music. Those forms which give symmetry and  proportion to the outward structure of the tonal art were pruned and  polished under ecclesiastical surveillance until spontaneity was  endangered. Happily in the spirit of Christianity is that which ever  proves a remedy for the mistakes of law-givers. The religion that  inculcates respect for the individual has furthered the advance of music  and of spirituality.    Beyond the confines of the church was another musical growth, springing  up by the wayside and in remote places. Folk-music it is called, and it  gives untrammeled utterance to human longings, human grief and despair,  and human wondering over the mysteries of life, death and the great  Beyond. Untutored people had always found vent in this kind of music for  pent-up feelings, and the folk-music of the Christian world, during the  Crusades, gained a new element in the fragments of Oriental melody  transplanted into its midst. In time, through the combined wisdom of  gifted composers and large-minded ecclesiastical rulers, the music of  the church and the music of the people became united, and modern music  was born.    Architecture, painting, sculpture and poetry possess practical proofs of  their past achievements and on these their present endeavors are  builded. Modern music has been compelled to be the architect of its own  fortunes. It is the one new art of our era, and, as the youngest in the  family of arts, it has but recently reached a high state of development.    During those eleven Christian centuries, from the latter part of the  fourth century, when the corner-stone for our musical system was laid,  until the wonderful exploration period of the fifteenth was well  advanced, the masters of music were absorbed in controlling the elements  of their art. Since then event has crowded upon event with rapidly  increasing ratio. During the past two centuries the progress of the art  has been like a tale in fairyland. We now possess a magnificent musical  vocabulary, a splendid musical literature, yet so accustomed are we to  grand treasure-troves we perhaps prize them no more than the meagre  stores of the past were prized.    Music is often mentioned in literature as a means of discipline,  inspiration and refreshment. We read in Homer that Achilles was  instructed in the art that he might learn to moderate his passions;  Pythagoras, father of Musical Science, counseled his disciples to  refresh themselves at the fount of music before retiring to their  couches at night in order to restore the inner harmony of their souls,  and to seek strength in the morning from the same source. Plato taught  that music is as essential to the mind as air is to the body, and that  children should be familiarized with harmonies and rhythms that they  might be more gentle, harmonious and rhythmical, consequently better  fitted for speech and action.    \"Song brings of itself a cheerfulness that wakes the heart to joy,\"  exclaimed Euripides, and certain it is a large measure of joy surrounds  those who live in an atmosphere of music. It has a magic wand that lifts  man beyond the petty worries of his existence. \"Music is a shower-bath  of the soul,\" said Schopenhauer, \"washing away all that is impure.\" Or  as Auerbach put it: \"Music washes from the soul the dust of everyday  life.\""]]]
