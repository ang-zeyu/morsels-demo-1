An engraved address implies some permanency of location.  Those who are liable to frequent changes of address would better omit  this addition to the visiting-card, writing the address in any  emergency that requires it.    No _messages_ are _written_ on a man's card, and no penciling is  allowed, except as above, to give (or correct) the address, or in the  case of \"_P. p. c._\" cards, sent by post.      CARDS FOR WOMEN    The rules in regard to titles are simple and brief.    A woman's name should never appear on a visiting-card without either  \"Mrs.\" or \"Miss\" prefixed.  The exception would be in the case of women  who have regularly graduated in theology or medicine.  Such are  entitled, like their brothers, to prefix \"Rev.\" or \"Dr.\" to their names.    A married woman's card is engraved with her husband's name, with the  prefix \"Mrs.\"  No matter how \"titled\" the husband may be, his _titles_  do not appear on his wife's visiting-card.  The wife of the President  is not \"Mrs. President Harrison,\" but \"Mrs. Benjamin Harrison.\"  She is  the wife of the _man_, not the wife of his _office_ or his _rank_.    A widow may, if she prefers, retain the card engraved during her  husband's lifetime, unless by so doing she confuses her identity with  that of some other \"Mrs. John Brown,\" whose husband is still living.  It is more strictly correct for a widow to resume her own given name,  and to have her card engraved \"Mrs. Mary Brown,\" or, if she chooses to  indicate her own patronymic, \"Mrs. Mary Dexter Brown.\"    An unmarried woman's card is engraved with her full name, or the  initials of given names, as she prefers, but always with the prefix  \"Miss\" (unless one of the professional titles referred to takes its  place).    The address may be engraved or written in the lower right corner.    If a society woman has a particular day for receiving calls, that fact  is announced in the lower left corner.  If this is engraved, it is  understood to be a fixed custom; if written, it may be a transient  arrangement.  If a weekly \"at home\" day is observed, the name of the  day is engraved, as \"Tuesdays.\"  This means that during \"calling hours\"  on _any_ Tuesday the hostess will be found at home.  If hours are  limited, that is also indicated, as \"from 4 to 6.\"  Further limitations  may be specified, as \"Tuesdays in February,\" \"Tuesdays until Lent,\"  \"Tuesdays after October,\" etc.  Any definite idea of time may be given  to meet the facts, the wording being made as terse as possible.  If the  regular \"at home\" day is Tuesday (unlimited), and the card is so  engraved, any of the special limitations may be penciled in to meet  special conditions.  Sometimes an informal invitation is thus conveyed;  as, by the addition, \"Tea, 4 to 6,\" etc.    _Other penciling_.--Cards left or sent, before leaving town, have \"_P.  p. c._\"--(_Pour prendre conge_)--penciled in the lower left corner.    A holiday, a birthday, a wedding anniversary, or other event in a  friend's life may be remembered by sending a card, upon which is  penciled \"Greeting,\" \"Congratulations,\" \"Best wishes,\" or some similar  expression.  Such cards may be sent alone, or may accompany gifts.    Any brief message may be penciled on a woman's card, provided the  message is sufficiently personal to partake of the nature of a social  courtesy.  But the card message should not be sent when courtesy  requires the more explicit and respectful form of a _note_.      CARDS FOR YOUNG WOMEN    In strictly formal circles a young woman, during her first year in  society, pays no visits alone.  She accompanies her mother or chaperon.  She has no separate card, but her name is engraved, or may be written,  beneath that of her mother (or chaperon) on a card employed for these  joint visits.  After a year or so of social experience (the period  being governed by the youth or maturity of the debutante, or by the  exigency of making way for a younger sister to be chaperoned), the  young woman becomes an identity socially, and has her separate card,  subject to the general rules for women's cards, even though she  continues to pay her most formal visits in company with her mother.      AFTER MARRIAGE CARDS    During the first year after marriage cards engraved thus: \"Mr. and Mrs.  Henry Bell Joyce,\" may be used by the couple in paying calls, or  returning wedding civilities.  Such cards are also used when jointly  sending presents at any time.  For general visiting, after the first  year, husband and wife have separate cards.      THE USE OF THE VISITING-CARD    A too profuse use of visiting-cards indicates crudity.  The trend of  fashion is toward restricting the quantity of paste-board, and  employing cards always when they are required, never when they are  superfluous.      CALLING IN PERSON    When one calls in person the name of the caller is given verbally to  the servant who opens the door.  The card is not usually sent up,  except by a stranger.  But sometimes there is difficulty in making the  servant understand the name or properly distinguish it from some other  similar name.  In this case to avoid mistakes the card is sent up.    If the hostess is not at home a card is left by the disappointed caller.    On the occasion of a _first_ call a card is left on the hall table, or  other place provided, _even though the caller has been received by the  hostess_.  This serves as a reminder that the acquaintance has been  duly and formally begun.    On the occasion of subsequent calls, when the hostess is at home, no  cards are employed, except, as before stated, to avert servants'  mistakes.  Such is the sensible dictum of good authorities, and one in  harmony with the idea that the personal card is the _representative_ of  its owner, not his _accompaniment_.    This idea is more pointedly illustrated in quiet neighborhoods, where  even the wealthy live simply of choice, and, like their neighbors of  moderate means, employ but one domestic, or, it may be, none.  In such  households often the guest is met at the door by a member of the  family, possibly the hostess herself.  The use of a visiting-card then  is plainly incongruous, not to say absurd.  The visitor who is paying a  \"first call\" under these informal conditions may find opportunity to  drop a card unobtrusively into the basket, if such receptacle be within  reach; but if this cannot be done without conspicuous effort the card  is better ignored, and its place as a remembrancer filled by the genial  impression which the visitor leaves, and of which an appreciative  hostess needs no card reminder.  Besides, people \"living quietly\" visit  so little, comparatively, that it is no severe tax on the memory to  recollect who has called, especially as the infrequency of calls gives  ample time for each one to make an individual impression.  This is not  possible when a steady stream of visitors is pouring in and out of a  drawing-room on a fashionable woman's \"at home\" day, scarcely giving  the hostess opportunity to gaze upon one face before another has  displaced it; so that at the end of the hour her memory recalls a  composite photograph.  Cards are her indispensable aids in resolving  this picture into its component elements.  But those who \"live  quietly,\" receiving but few calls, have no such bewildering complexity  to deal with.    At the same time, these people thus quietly environed may represent the  most refined and cultivated circle.  They may know perfectly well what  formal etiquette would demand in the matter of cards if the conditions  were more formal.  The omission of cards whenever their use would be  forced, so far from indicating ignorance, is a proof of discrimination.    Personal calls are made in the following cases:    In returning a first visit, made in person.    After a dinner party to which one has been invited, whether the  invitation was accepted or not.    After any entertainment other than a dinner it is allowable to leave or  send cards instead of paying a personal call.  This is a wise rule in  cases where a hostess, has a long visiting list, and entertains  frequently.  To receive afterward personal visits from all of her  guests would be practically impossible.  The majority will express  their acknowledgments by card, leaving it to the most intimate friends  of the hostess to pay their respects in person.  But among quiet  people, where one \"Tea\" is the extent of a hostess' efforts for the  season, the personal call is desirable as showing greater respect and  friendliness.  Among congenial friends only the plea of a busy life can  make the card acknowledgment quite as graceful and acceptable as the  personal visit.  But if the guest is a comparative stranger, and, for  any reason, there is a wish not to extend the acquaintance, the sending  of a card meets all the requirements of etiquette, without committing  the sender to any further intimacy.    (The alternative for personal calls, is personal card-leaving; the next  point to be considered.)      CARD-LEAVING IS LIEU OF PERSONAL CALLS    When personal calls are not practicable, nor desirable, the leaving of  cards is accepted as an equivalent.    A few years ago, fashion demanded that all visiting-cards expressing or  acknowledging social civilities should be left in person; the  alternative in emergencies being to send them by the hand of a private  messenger, never through the post-office.  There was good excuse for  this fashion in our grandmother's day, when the post was a slow coach,  or a storm-stayed postillion; but the admirable system of our postal  service to-day leaves no excuse for the prejudice in favor of the  private messenger; and it is not surprising that fashion has yielded to"]]]
