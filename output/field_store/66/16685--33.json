How the religion of the Babylonians developed.    The fact that the rise of Merodach to the position of king of the gods  was due to the attainment, by the city of Babylon, of the position of  capital of all Babylonia, leads one to suspect that the kingly rank of  his father Ea, at an earlier period, was due to a somewhat similar  cause, and if so, the still earlier kingship of Anu, the god of the  heavens, may be in like manner explained. This leads to the question  whether the first state to attain to supremacy was Der, Anu's seat,  and whether Der was succeeded by Eridu, of which city Ea was the  patron--concerning the importance of Babylon, Merodach's city, later  on, there is no doubt whatever. The rise of Anu and Ea to divine  overlordship, however, may not have been due to the political  supremacy of the cities where they were worshipped--it may have come  about simply on account of renown gained through religious enthusiasm  due to wonders said to have been performed where they were worshipped,  or to the reported discovery of new records concerning their temples,  or to the influence of some renowned high-priest, like En-we-dur-an-ki  of Sippar, whose devotion undoubtedly brought great renown to the city  of his dominion.                          Was Animism its original form?    But the question naturally arises, can we go back beyond the  indications of the inscriptions? The Babylonians attributed life, in  certain not very numerous cases, to such things as trees and plants,  and naturally to the winds, and the heavenly bodies. Whether they  regarded stones, rocks, mountains, storms, and rain in the same way,  however, is doubtful, but it may be taken for granted, that the sea,  with all its rivers and streams, was regarded as animated with the  spirit of Ea and his children, whilst the great cities and  temple-towers were pervaded with the spirit of the god whose abode  they were. Innumerable good and evil spirits were believed in, such as  the spirit of the mountain, the sea, the plain, and the grave. These  spirits were of various kinds, and bore names which do not always  reveal their real character--such as the /edimmu/, /utukku/, /sedu/,  /asakku/ (spirit of fevers), /namtaru/ (spirit of fate), /alu/  (regarded as the spirit of the south wind), /gallu/, /rabisu/,  /labartu/, /labasu/, /ahhazu/ (the seizer), /lilu/ and /lilithu/ (male  and female spirits of the mist), with their attendants.    All this points to animism as the pervading idea of the worship of the  peoples of the Babylonian states in the prehistoric period--the  attribution of life to every appearance of nature. The question is,  however, Is the evidence of the inscriptions sufficient to make this  absolutely certain? It is hard to believe that such intelligent  people, as the primitive Babylonians naturally were, believed that  such things as stones, rocks, mountains, storms, and rain were, in  themselves, and apart from the divinity which they regarded as  presiding over them, living things. A stone might be a /bit ili/ or  bethel--a \"house of god,\" and almost invested with the status of a  living thing, but that does not prove that the Babylonians thought of  every stone as being endowed with life, even in prehistoric times.  Whilst, therefore, there are traces of a belief similar to that which  an animistic creed might be regarded as possessing, it must be  admitted that these seemingly animistic doctrines may have originated  in another way, and be due to later developments. The power of the  gods to create living things naturally makes possible the belief that  they had also power to endow with a soul, and therefore with life and  intelligence, any seemingly inanimate object. Such was probably the  nature of Babylonian animism, if it may be so called. The legend of  Tiawthu (Tiawath) may with great probability be regarded as the  remains of a primitive animism which was the creed of the original and  comparatively uncivilised Babylonians, who saw in the sea the producer  and creator of all the monstrous shapes which are found therein; but  any development of this idea in other directions was probably cut  short by the priests, who must have realised, under the influence of  the doctrine of the divine rise to perfection, that animism in general  was altogether incompatible with the creed which they professed.                         Image-worship and Sacred Stones.    Whether image-worship was original among the Babylonians and Assyrians  is uncertain, and improbable; the tendency among the people in early  times being to venerate sacred stones and other inanimate objects. As  has been already pointed out, the {diopetres} of the Greeks was  probably a meteorite, and stones marking the position of the Semitic  bethels were probably, in their origin, the same. The boulders which  were sometimes used for boundary-stones may have been the  representations of these meteorites in later times, and it is  noteworthy that the Sumerian group for \"iron,\" /an-bar/, implies that  the early Babylonians only knew of that metal from meteoric ironstone.  The name of the god Nirig or Enu-restu (Ninip) is generally written  with the same group, implying some kind of connection between the  two--the god and the iron. In a well-known hymn to that deity certain  stones are mentioned, one of them being described as the \"poison-tooth\"[1]  coming forth on the mountain, recalling the sacred rocks at  Jerusalem and Mecca. Boundary-stones in Babylonia were not sacred  objects except in so far as they were sculptured with the signs of the  gods.[2] With regard to the Babylonian bethels, very little can be  said, their true nature being uncertain, and their number, to all  appearance, small. Gifts were made to them, and from this fact it  would seem that they were temples--true \"houses of god,\" in  fact--probably containing an image of the deity, rather than a stone  similar to those referred to in the Old Testament.    [1] So called, probably, not because it sent forth poison, but on      account of its likeness to a serpent's fang.    [2] Notwithstanding medical opinion, their phallic origin is doubtful.      One is sculptured in the form of an Eastern castellated fortress.                                      Idols.    With the Babylonians, the gods were represented by means of stone  images at a very early date, and it is possible that wood was also  used. The tendency of the human mind being to attribute to the Deity a  human form, the Babylonians were no exception to the rule. Human  thoughts and feelings would naturally accompany the human form with  which the minds of men endowed them. Whether the gross human passions  attributed to the gods of Babylonia in Herodotus be of early date or  not is uncertain--a late period, when the religion began to  degenerate, would seem to be the more probable.                         The adoration of sacred objects.    It is probable that objects belonging to or dedicated to deities were  not originally worshipped--they were held as divine in consequence of  their being possessed or used by a deity, like the bow of Merodach,  placed in the heavens as a constellation, etc. The cities where the  gods dwelt on earth, their temples, their couches, the chariot of the  sun in his temple-cities, and everything existing in connection with  their worship, were in all probability regarded as divine simply in so  far as they belonged to a god. Sacrifices offered to them, and  invocations made to them, were in all likelihood regarded as having  been made to the deity himself, the possessions of the divinity being,  in the minds of the Babylonians, pervaded with his spirit. In the case  of rivers, these were divine as being the children and offspring of  Enki (Aa or Ea), the god of the ocean.                                   Holy places.    In a country which was originally divided into many small states, each  having its own deities, and, to a certain extent, its own religious  system, holy places were naturally numerous. As the spot where they  placed Paradise, Babylonia was itself a holy place, but in all  probability this idea is late, and only came into existence after the  legends of the creation and the rise of Merodach to the kingship of  heaven had become elaborated into one homogeneous whole.                               An interesting list.    One of the most interesting documents referring to the holy places of  Babylonia is a tiny tablet found at Nineveh, and preserved in the  British Museum. This text begins with the word Tiawthu \"the sea,\" and  goes on to enumerate, in turn, Tilmun (identified with the island of  Bahrein in the Persian Gulf); Engurra (the Abyss, the abode of Enki or  Ea), with numerous temples and shrines, including \"the holy house,\"  \"the temple of the seer of heaven and earth,\" \"the abode of  Zer-panitum,\" consort of Merodach, \"the throne of the holy place,\" \"the  temple of the region of Hades,\" \"the supreme temple of life,\" \"the  temple of the ear of the corn-deity,\" with many others, the whole list  containing what may be regarded as the chief sanctuaries of the land,  to the number of thirty-one. Numerous other similar and more extensive  lists, enumerating every shrine and temple in the country, also exist,  though in a very imperfect state, and in addition to these, many holy  places are referred to in the bilingual, historical, and other  inscriptions. All the great cities of Babylonia, moreover, were sacred  places, the chief in renown and importance in later days being the  great city of Babylon, where E-sagila, \"the temple of the high head,\"  in which was apparently the shrine called \"the temple of the  foundation of heaven and earth,\" held the first place. This building  is called by Nebuchadnezzar \"the temple-tower of Babylon,\" and may  better be regarded as the site of the Biblical \"Tow"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/207"],[0,"The Spell of the Yukon and Other Verses (#3)"],[1,"the arid sun-lands through and through?     Have you chummed up with the mesa?  Do you know its moods and changes?      Then listen to the Wild -- it's calling you.       Have you known the Great White Silence, not a snow-gemmed twig aquiver?      (Eternal truths that shame our soothing lies.)     Have you broken trail on snowshoes? mushed your huskies up the river,      Dared the unknown, led the way, and clutched the prize?     Have you marked the map's void spaces, mingled with the mongrel races,      Felt the savage strength of brute in every thew?     And though grim as hell the worst is, can you round it off with curses?      Then hearken to the Wild -- it's wanting you.       Have you suffered, starved and triumphed,       groveled down, yet grasped at glory,      Grown bigger in the bigness of the whole?     \"Done things\" just for the doing, letting babblers tell the story,      Seeing through the nice veneer the naked soul?     Have you seen God in His splendors, heard the text that nature renders?      (You'll never hear it in the family pew.)     The simple things, the true things, the silent men who do things --      Then listen to the Wild -- it's calling you.       They have cradled you in custom, they have primed you with their preaching,      They have soaked you in convention through and through;     They have put you in a showcase; you're a credit to their teaching --      But can't you hear the Wild? -- it's calling you.     Let us probe the silent places, let us seek what luck betide us;      Let us journey to a lonely land I know.     There's a whisper on the night-wind, there's a star agleam to guide us,      And the Wild is calling, calling... let us go.          The Lone Trail                _Ye who know the Lone Trail fain would follow it,          Though it lead to glory or the darkness of the pit.          Ye who take the Lone Trail, bid your love good-by;          The Lone Trail, the Lone Trail follow till you die._       The trails of the world be countless, and most of the trails be tried;     You tread on the heels of the many, till you come where the ways divide;     And one lies safe in the sunlight, and the other is dreary and wan,     Yet you look aslant at the Lone Trail, and the Lone Trail lures you on.     And somehow you're sick of the highway, with its noise and its easy needs,     And you seek the risk of the by-way, and you reck not where it leads.     And sometimes it leads to the desert, and the tongue swells out of the mouth,     And you stagger blind to the mirage, to die in the mocking drouth.     And sometimes it leads to the mountain, to the light of the lone camp-fire,     And you gnaw your belt in the anguish of hunger-goaded desire.     And sometimes it leads to the Southland, to the swamp where the orchid glows,     And you rave to your grave with the fever,       and they rob the corpse for its clothes.     And sometimes it leads to the Northland, and the scurvy softens your bones,     And your flesh dints in like putty, and you spit out your teeth like stones.     And sometimes it leads to a coral reef in the wash of a weedy sea,     And you sit and stare at the empty glare where the gulls wait greedily.     And sometimes it leads to an Arctic trail,       and the snows where your torn feet freeze,     And you whittle away the useless clay, and crawl on your hands and knees.     Often it leads to the dead-pit; always it leads to pain;     By the bones of your brothers ye know it, but oh, to follow you're fain.     By your bones they will follow behind you,       till the ways of the world are made plain.            _Bid good-by to sweetheart, bid good-by to friend;          The Lone Trail, the Lone Trail follow to the end.          Tarry not, and fear not, chosen of the true;          Lover of the Lone Trail, the Lone Trail waits for you._          The Pines           We sleep in the sleep of ages, the bleak, barbarian pines;     The gray moss drapes us like sages, and closer we lock our lines,     And deeper we clutch through the gelid gloom where never a sunbeam shines.       On the flanks of the storm-gored ridges are our black battalions massed;     We surge in a host to the sullen coast, and we sing in the ocean blast;     From empire of sea to empire of snow we grip our empire fast.       To the niggard lands were we driven, 'twixt desert and floes are we penned;     To us was the Northland given, ours to stronghold and defend;     Ours till the world be riven in the crash of the utter end;       Ours from the bleak beginning, through the aeons of death-like sleep;     Ours from the shock when the naked rock was hurled from the hissing deep;     Ours through the twilight ages of weary glacier creep.       Wind of the East, Wind of the West, wandering to and fro,     Chant your songs in our topmost boughs, that the sons of men may know     The peerless pine was the first to come, and the pine will be last to go!       We pillar the halls of perfumed gloom; we plume where the eagles soar;     The North-wind swoops from the brooding Pole,       and our ancients crash and roar;     But where one falls from the crumbling walls shoots up a hardy score.       We spring from the gloom of the canyon's womb; in the valley's lap we lie;     From the white foam-fringe, where the breakers cringe       to the peaks that tusk the sky,     We climb, and we peer in the crag-locked mere that gleams like a golden eye.       Gain to the verge of the hog-back ridge where the vision ranges free:     Pines and pines and the shadow of pines as far as the eye can see;     A steadfast legion of stalwart knights in dominant empery.       Sun, moon and stars give answer; shall we not staunchly stand,     Even as now, forever, wards of the wilder strand,     Sentinels of the stillness, lords of the last, lone land?          The Lure of Little Voices           There's a cry from out the loneliness -- oh, listen, Honey, listen!      Do you hear it, do you fear it, you're a-holding of me so?     You're a-sobbing in your sleep, dear, and your lashes, how they glisten --      Do you hear the Little Voices all a-begging me to go?       All a-begging me to leave you.  Day and night they're pleading, praying,      On the North-wind, on the West-wind, from the peak and from the plain;     Night and day they never leave me -- do you know what they are saying?      \"He was ours before you got him, and we want him once again.\"       Yes, they're wanting me, they're haunting me, the awful lonely places;      They're whining and they're whimpering as if each had a soul;     They're calling from the wilderness, the vast and God-like spaces,      The stark and sullen solitudes that sentinel the Pole.       They miss my little camp-fires, ever brightly, bravely gleaming      In the womb of desolation, where was never man before;     As comradeless I sought them, lion-hearted, loving, dreaming,      And they hailed me as a comrade, and they loved me evermore.       And now they're all a-crying, and it's no use me denying;      The spell of them is on me and I'm helpless as a child;     My heart is aching, aching, but I hear them, sleeping, waking;      It's the Lure of Little Voices, it's the mandate of the Wild.       I'm afraid to tell you, Honey, I can take no bitter leaving;      But softly in the sleep-time from your love I'll steal away.     Oh, it's cruel, dearie, cruel, and it's God knows how I'm grieving;      But His loneliness is calling, and He knows I must obey.          The Song of the Wage-Slave           When the long, long day is over, and the Big Boss gives me my pay,     I hope that it won't be hell-fire, as some of the parsons say.     And I hope that it won't be heaven, with some of the parsons I've met --     All I want is just quiet, just to rest and forget.     Look at my face, toil-furrowed; look at my calloused hands;     Master, I've done Thy bidding, wrought in Thy many lands --     Wrought for the little masters, big-bellied they be, and rich;     I've done their desire for a daily hire, and I die like a dog in a ditch.     I have used the strength Thou hast given, Thou knowest I did not shirk;     Threescore years of labor -- Thine be the long day's work.     And now, Big Master, I'm broken and bent and twisted and scarred,     But I've held my job, and Thou knowest, and Thou will not judge me hard.     Thou knowest my sins are many, and often I've played the fool --     Whiskey and cards and women, they made me the devil's tool.     I was just like a child with money; I flung it away with a curse,     Feasting a fawning parasite, or glutting a harlot's purse;     Then back to the woods repentant, back to the mill or the mine,     I, the worker of workers, everything in my line.     Everything hard but headwork (I'd no more brains than a kid),     A brute with brute strength to labor, doing as I was bid;     Living in camps with men-folk, a lonely and loveless life;     Never knew kiss of sweetheart, never caress of wife.     A brute with brute strength to labor, and they were so far above --     Yet I'd gladly have gone to the gallows for one little look of Love.     I, with the strength of two men, savage and shy and wild --     Yet how I'd ha' treasured a woman, and the sweet, warm kiss of a child!     Well, 'tis Thy world, and Thou knowest.  I blaspheme and my ways be rude;     But I've lived my life as I found it, and I've done my best to be good;     I, the primitive toiler, half naked and grimed to the eyes,     Sweating it deep in their ditches, swining it stark in their styes;     Hurling down forests before me, spanning tumultuous streams;     Down in the ditch building o'er me palaces fairer than dreams;     Boring the rock to the ore-bed, driving the road through the fen,     Resolute, dumb, uncomplaining, a man in a world of men.     Master, I've filled my contract, wrought in Thy many lands;     Not by my sins wilt Thou judge me, but by the work of "]]]
