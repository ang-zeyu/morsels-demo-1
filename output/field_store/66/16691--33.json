(Face South and Southwest.)      LOCATION.--The head of Hydra, a striking and beautiful arrangement of  stars, lies just below the Bee Hive, in Cancer, 6[deg] south of Acubens in  that constellation, and forms a rhomboidal figure of five stars.    Hydra is about 100[deg] in length and reaches almost from Canis Minor to  Libra. Its stars are all faint except Alphard, or the Hydra's heart, a  second-magnitude star remarkable for its lonely situation, southwest  of Regulus, in Leo. A line drawn from [g] Leonis through Regulus  points it out. It is of a rich orange tint. Castor and Pollux, in  Gemini, point southeast to it.    The constellations Crater, the Cup, and Corvus, the Crow, both stand  on the coils of Hydra, south of Denebola, the bright star in the tail  of the Lion.    Hydra is supposed to be the snake shown on a uranographic stone from  the Euphrates, 1200 B.C.    The little asterism Sextans, the Sextant, lies in the region between  Regulus and Alphard. It contains no stars brighter than the fourth  magnitude.    [Illustration: HYDRA]          LEO (le'o)--THE LION. (Face South.)      LOCATION.--A line drawn from Pollux, in Gemini, to [g] in Cancer, and  prolonged about 12[deg], strikes Regulus, the brilliant star in the heart  of the Lion. Regulus lies about 9[deg] east of Acubens, in Cancer, and  about 12[deg] northeast of Alphard, in the heart of Hydra.    Leo is one of the most beautiful constellations in the zodiac. It lies  south of the Great Bear, and its principal stars are arranged in the  form of a sickle which nearly outlines the Lion's head. This group is  so striking as to be unmistakable. Regulus is in the handle of the  sickle. It is one of the stars from which longitude is reckoned, lies  almost exactly on the ecliptic, and is visible for eight months in the  year.    Denebola, the bright star in the Lion's tail, lies 25[deg] east of  Regulus, and about 35[deg] west of Arcturus, in Bo[:o]tes. It is the same  distance northwest of Spica, in Virgo, and forms with Spica and  Arcturus a large equilateral triangle.    [z] is double, and has three faint companion stars.    [e] has two seventh-magnitude companion stars, forming a beautiful  little triangle.    Regulus is white in color, [g] yellow, [p] red.    [g] is a beautiful colored telescopic double star and has a companion  visible in an opera-glass.    The figure of Leo very much as we now have it appears in all the  Indian and Egyptian zodiacs.    [Illustration: LEO    THE SICKLE]          COMA BERENICES (k[=o]'-ma ber-e-ni'-sez)--BERENICE'S HAIR.      LOCATION.--A line drawn from Regulus to Zosma, in Leo, and prolonged  an equal distance, strikes this fine cluster, which is 18[deg] northeast  of Zosma, [d] Leonis.    The group lies well within a triangle formed by Denebola, Arcturus, in  Bo[:o]tes, and Cor Caroli, in Canes Venatici, which triangle is the upper  half of the Diamond of Virgo.    Twenty or thirty stars in this group can be counted with an  opera-glass, and the group can be easily distinguished with the naked  eye, when the moon is not visible.    The first half of the month of April can be called the most brilliant  sidereal period of the year. At this time eleven first-magnitude stars  are visible in this latitude at 9 P.M. From east to west they are:  Vega, Arcturus, Spica, Regulus, Pollux, Procyon, Sirius, Capella,  Aldebaran, Betelgeuze, and Rigel, truly a glorious company, an  incomparable sight.    [Illustration: COMA BERENICES]          CANIS MINOR (k[=a]'-nis mi'-nor)--THE LESSER DOG. (Face West.)      LOCATION.--Procyon, the Little Dog Star, lies about 23[deg] south of  Pollux, in Gemini. A line drawn from Nath, in Auriga, to Alhena, in  Gemini, and prolonged about 18[deg], reaches Procyon.    Procyon is equidistant from Betelgeuze in Orion, and Sirius in Canis  Major, and forms with them an equilateral triangle. It forms a large  right-angled triangle with Pollux and Betelgeuze.    The light from Procyon is golden yellow. Four degrees northwest of it  is the third-magnitude star Gomeisa. The glass shows two small stars  forming a right-angled triangle with it.    Procyon was distinctly mentioned by Ptolemy. It rises in this latitude  a little north of east about half an hour before Sirius, the Dog Star,  hence it was called Procyon from two Greek words which signify \"before  the dog.\"    Procyon is one of our nearest neighbors in space, at a distance of ten  light years, and is attended by a very faint companion which is only  visible in the largest telescopes.    [Illustration: CANIS MINOR]          CORVUS (k[^o]r'-vus)--THE CROW. (Face South.)      LOCATION.--A line drawn from the Bee Hive, in Cancer, through Regulus,  in Leo, and prolonged about 40[deg], ends near the conspicuous  quadrilateral which distinguishes Corvus. The brightest star in this  region of the sky is Spica, in Virgo. It lies about 10[deg] northeast of  Algorab.    [z] is a double star for an opera-glass. A faint pair of stars lie  close below and to the west of [b]. The Crow is represented as  standing on, and pecking at, the coils of Hydra. The star Al Chiba is  in the Crow's bill.    Corvus was known as the Raven in Chaucer's time.    [d] is an interesting telescopic double.    A line drawn from [g] to [b] Corvi and prolonged twice its length  locates the third-magnitude star [i] Centauri in the right shoulder of  the Centaur. The brightest stars in this constellation are not visible  in this latitude.    [Illustration: CORVUS]          CRATER (kr[=a]'-ter)--THE CUP. (Face South.)      LOCATION.--Crater is situated 15[deg] west of Corvus, and due south of  [th] Leonis. It is easily distinguished by reason of a beautiful and  very striking semicircle of six stars of the fourth magnitude, forming  the bowl of the cup.    The constellation resembles a goblet with its base resting on the  coils of Hydra.    The star Alkes is common to Hydra and Crater, and may be seen 24[deg]  southeast of Alphard in the heart of Hydra. It is distinguished by its  forming an equilateral triangle with [a] and [g], stars of the same  magnitude 6[deg] south and east of it.    Corvus and Crater are to be seen half-way up the southern sky during  the early evenings in spring.    [d] is now the lucida.    Crater is situated at about the centre of Hydra and is on the  meridian, April 26th. Owing to its many faint stars it is best seen on  a clear moonless night.    The zodiacal light is well worth observing at this season of the year.  It is to be seen in the western sky shortly after sundown, and is most  intense during the evenings of March.
