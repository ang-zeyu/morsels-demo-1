(#3)"],[1,"antime, the hereditary Prince of  Brunswick had checked the career of Soubise, and destroyed many of his  magazines; and soon after the French went into winter quarters--Soubise  on the Lower Rhine, and Broglie at Cassel.    Frederick had taken the field in the month of April, and had marched  into Silesia, where the fortress of Schweidnitz was threatened by  the Austrian general, Laudon. On his approach, Laudon retreated into  Bohemia, where he was joined by fresh columns of Russians under Marshal  Butterlin. At the same time another Russian horde, under Romanzow,  re-occupied Pomerania. The Austrian and Russian generals conceived that  they could hem in Frederick, and prevent his escape; but aware of his  danger, the skilful monarch threw himself into his fortified camp of  Buntzelwitz, from behind the strong ramparts of which he laughed his  enemies to scorn. A blockade was attempted, but the country, wasted by  long wars, had become like a wilderness, and afforded no food either  for man or horse; while their provision-waggons, 5000 in number, had all  been taken by a flying column of Prussians, under General Platen, who  had also destroyed three of the largest magazines which the Russians had  established on the confines of Poland. Famine stared them in the face,  and breaking up their blockade, Butterlin marched into Pomerania, and  Laudon to an entrenched camp, near Fribourg. Thus relieved, Frederick  marched towards Upper Silesia, which proved to be an unfortunate  movement; for Laudon, taking advantage of it, rushed from his entrenched  camp, made an assault by night upon Schweidnitz, which lie took by  storm, and then took up his winter-quarters in Silesia. About the same  time the Russians, assisted by the Swedes, took Colberg, which enabled  them to winter in Pomerania and Brandenburg.    In the meantime the arms of the English had, for the most part, been  successfully employed. Pondicherry, the capital settlement of the  French in, the East Indies, and their last stronghold in that country,  surrendered at discretion to Colonel Coote, after the garrison and  inhabitants had been reduced to the necessity of feeding on the flesh of  camels and elephants, and even upon dogs and vermin. In the West Indies,  also, Lord Rollo and Sir James Douglas reduced the island of Dominica,  which, contrary to treaty, had been fortified by the French. A  less important conquest was made on the coast of Brittany. A secret  expedition, which had been for some time in preparation, suddenly sailed  from Spithead, and under the command of Commodore Kepple, with troops on  board under General Hodgson, took its course across the Channel. Great  things were expected as the result of this expedition, but it only  enacted the old story of \"The mountain in labour.\" The point against  which this force was directed was the sterile rock of Bellisle, which,  at the expense of two thousand lives, was captured. Thus disappointed,  the people complained of the obstinacy of Pitt, and asked,  sarcastically, what could be done with it? Nevertheless, if it was no  use to England, it was a place of importance to France, as commanding  a large extent of coast, and affording a convenient receptacle to  privateers, whence it was insisted on as a valuable article of exchange,  when peace was concluded between the two nations.          THE RESIGNATION OF MR. PITT.    At this time France was rapidly sinking under the efforts made to  sustain war. Many of her colonies were conquered, her navy was ruined,  and her finances exhausted, while the people were impoverished and  discontented. Under these circumstances the king wished for repose and  peace, and in this wish, Sweden, Poland, and even Russia were ready to  join. Austria alone, whose empress-queen was bent on the recovery of  Silesia, and the overthrow of its conqueror Frederick, was desirous of  prolonging hostilities.    This wish of the king of France--which was also the wish of his  people--seemed to be favoured by circumstances in England. The influence  of Pitt was daily growing weaker, and Bute was fast gaining paramount  ascendancy. The French ministers, therefore, flattered themselves that  there would be no great difficulty in negociating; especially as they  were ready and willing to make some sacrifices, in order to obtain  peace. Accordingly an interchange of memorials was commenced, and in the  month of July Mr. Stanley was dispatched to Paris, while the Count de  Bussy came over to London, for the purpose of negociating. Preliminaries  were mutually proposed and examined. On their part the French offered  to cede Canada; to restore Minorca in exchange for Guadaloupe and  Marigalante; to give up Senegal and Goree for Anamaboo and Acra; to  renounce all claim to Cape Breton, on which no fortification was to  be erected; and to consent that Dunkirk should be demolished. But one  demand made by the French was fatal to the success of the negociations.  They demanded the restitution of all the captures made at sea by the  English before the declaration of war, on the ground that such captures  were contrary to all international law, which restitution was sternly  and absolutely refused, the English ministers arguing, that the right of  all hostile operations results not from a formal declaration of war, but  from the original hostilities of the aggressor. Another obstacle in the  way of peace, was the refusal of the French to restore Cassel, Gueldres,  and other places which they had taken from his Prussian majesty,  although they were ready to evacuate what they occupied in Hanover. And  as if these obstacles were not sufficient, the French preliminaries  were accompanied by a private memorial, demanding from England the  satisfaction of certain claims advanced by Spain, a country with which,  though differences existed, England was at peace. The French ambassador  was given to understand on this point, that the king of England would  never suffer his disputes with Spain to be thus mixed up with the  negociations carrying on with his country, and the cabinet called upon  the Spanish ambassador to disavow all participation in such a procedure,  and to state that his court was neither cognizant of it, nor wished to  blend its trifling differences with the weighty quarrels of France. But  this demand produced an unlooked-for budget, The Spanish ambassador at  first returned an evasive reply, but he was soon authorized by the court  of Spain to declare, that the proceedings of the French envoy had the  entire sanction of his Catholic majesty; and that, while his master was  anxious for peace, he was united as much by mutual interest as by the  ties of blood with the king of France. The fact is, Charles III., who  now occupied the throne of Spain, had privately agreed, before this  date, with the King of France, to consider every power as their common  enemy who might become the enemy of either, and to afford mutual  succours by sea and land. It had been also stipulated between them, that  no proposal of peace to their common enemies was to be made except by  common consent; that the two monarchs were to act as if they formed one  and the same power; that they should maintain for each other all the  possessions which they might possess at the conclusion of peace; and  finally, that the King of Naples might be allowed to participate in  their treaty, though no other family, except a prince of the house of  Bourbon, was to be admitted into this family compact.    Negociations for peace, therefore, proved abortive. Even Bute considered  many of the proposals of the French if not insulting to the majesty  of the British nation, at least inadmissible. Yet these negociations  resulted in the downfall of Pitt. At the council-table, that great  minister represented that Spain was only waiting for the arrival of  her annual plate-fleet from America, and then she would declare war.  He proposed, therefore, that her declaration should be anticipated by  England: that war should be forthwith proclaimed against Spain, and a  fleet sent out to intercept her ships and treasures from the western  world. He likewise proposed an immediate attack upon her colonies;  recommending the capture of the Havannah and the occupation of the  Isthmus of Panama, from whence an expedition might be sent against  Manilla and the Philippine Isles, to intercept the communication between  the continent of South America and the rich regions of the East. It  suited the purpose of Bute, however, to raise the laugh of incredulity  as to the declaration of war by Spain, questioning, at the same time,  the real meaning of the treaty entered into between the two Bourbons.  The other members of the cabinet also--Lord Temple excepted--pronounced  the measures proposed by Pitt too precipitate, and he had no alternative  but to resign; especially as he found, also, that the king was adverse  to his schemes. Accordingly, on the 6th of October, Pitt delivered  up his seals to the king, which his majesty received with ease and  firmness, but without requesting him to resume them. The monarch,  notwithstanding, lamented to him the loss of so valuable a servant,  while he declared that even if his cabinet had been unanimous for war  with Spain, he should have found great difficulty in consenting to such  a measure. Pitt was affected by the kind, yet dignified, behaviour of  the young king. \"I confess, sire,\" said he, with emotion, \"I had but  too much reason to expect your majesty's displeasure: I did not come  prepared for this exceeding goodness: pardon me, sir; it overpowers,--it  oppresses me.\"    Pitt retired with a pension of L3,000 per annum, which was to be  continued for three lives. The peerage was offered him, but he declined  it personally, accepting it only for his wife and her issue. He was  succeeded in office by Lord Egremont, son of the great Tory, Sir William  Wyndam. At the same time Lord Temple retired from"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19226"],[0,"The Dog's Book of Verse (#3)"],[1,"mains. When riches take wings, and    reputation falls to pieces, he is as constant in his love as the    sun in its journey through the heavens.\"_        SENATOR GEORGE GRAHAM VEST.            CLUNY        I am quite sure he thinks that I am God--    Since he is God on whom each one depends    For life, and all things that his bounty sends--    My dear old dog, most constant of all friends;      Not quick to mind, but quicker far than I    To him whom God I know and own; his eye,    Deep brown and liquid, watches for my nod;    He is more patient underneath the rod      Than I, when God his wise corrections sends.    He looks love at me deep as words e'er spake,    And from me never crumb or sup will take    But he wags thanks with his most vocal tail.      And when some crashing noise wakes all his fear    He is content and quiet if I'm near,    Secure that my protection will prevail!      So, faithful, mindful, thankful, trustful, he    Tells me what I unto my God should be.        WILLIAM CROSWELL DOANE.            THE BEST FRIEND        If I was sad, then he had grief, as well--    Seeking my hands with soft insistent paw,    Searching my face with anxious eyes that saw    More than my halting, human speech could tell;    Eyes wide with wisdom, fine, compassionate--    Dear, loyal one, that knew not wrong nor hate.      If I made merry--then how he would strive    To show his joy; \"Good master, let's to play,    The world is ours,\" that gladsome bark would say;    \"Just yours and mine--'tis fun to be alive!\"    Our world ... four walls above the city's din,    My crutch the bar that ever held us in.      Whate'er my mood--the fretful word, or sweet,    The swift command, the wheedling undertone,    His faith was fixed, his love was mine, alone,    His heaven was here at my slow crippled feet:    Oh, friend thrice-lost; oh, fond heart unassailed,    Ye taught me trust when man's dull logic failed.        MERIBAH ABBOTT.            MY DOG AND I        When living seems but little worth    And all things go awry,    I close the door, we journey forth--    My dog and I!      For books and pen we leave behind,    But little careth he,    His one great joy in life is just    To be with me.      He notes by just one upward glance    My mental attitude,    As on we go past laughing stream    And singing wood.      The soft winds have a magic touch    That brings to care release,    The trees are vocal with delight,    The rivers sing of peace.      How good it is to be alive!    Nature, the healer strong,    Has set each pulse with life athrill    And joy and song.      Discouragement! 'Twas but a name,    And all things that annoy,    Out in the lovely world of June    Life seemeth only joy!      And ere we reach the busy town,    Like birds my troubles fly,    We are two comrades glad of heart--    My dog and I!        ALICE J. CLEATOR.            MY GENTLEMAN        I own a dog who is a gentleman;    By birth most surely, since the creature can    Boast of a pedigree the like of which    Holds not a Howard nor a Metternich.      By breeding. Since the walks of life he trod    He never wagged an unkind tale abroad,    He never snubbed a nameless cur because    Without a friend or credit card he was.      By pride. He looks you squarely in the face    Unshrinking and without a single trace    Of either diffidence or arrogant    Assertion such as upstarts often flaunt.      By tenderness. The littlest girl may tear    With absolute impunity his hair,    And pinch his silken, flowing ears, the while    He smiles upon her--yes, I've seen him smile.      By loyalty. No truer friend than he    Has come to prove his friendship's worth to me.    He does not fear the master--knows no fear--    But loves the man who is his master here.      By countenance. If there be nobler eyes,    More full of honor and of honesties,    In finer head, on broader shoulders found,    Then have I never met the man or hound.      Here is the motto on my lifeboat's log:    \"God grant I may be worthy of my dog!\"        ANONYMOUS.            THE DEAD BOY'S PORTRAIT    AND HIS DOG        Day after day I have come and sat    Beseechingly upon the mat,    Wistfully wondering where you are at.      Why have they placed you on the wall,    So deathly still, so strangely tall?    You do not turn from me, nor call.      Why do I never hear my name?    Why are you fastened in a frame?    You are the same, and not the same.      Away from me why do you stare    So far out in the distance where    I am not? I am here! Not there!      What has your little doggie done?    You used to whistle me to run    Beside you, or ahead, for fun!      You used to pat me, and a glow    Of pleasure through my life would go!    How is it that I shiver so?      My tail was once a waving flag    Of welcome. Now I cannot wag    It for the weight I have to drag.      I know not what has come to me.    'Tis only in my sleep I see    Things smiling as they used to be.      I do not dare to bark; I plead    But dumbly, and you never heed;    Nor my protection seem to need.      I watch the door, I watch the gate;    I am watching early, watching late,    Your doggie still!--I watch and wait.        GERALD MASSEY.            ADVICE TO A DOG PAINTER        Happiest of the spaniel race,    Painter, with thy colors grace,    Draw his forehead large and high,    Draw his blue and humid eye;    Draw his neck, so smooth and round,    Little neck with ribands bound;    And the musely swelling breast    Where the Loves and Graces rest;    And the spreading, even back,    Soft, and sleek, and glossy black;    And the tail that gently twines,    Like the tendrils of the vines;    And the silky twisted hair,    Shadowing thick the velvet ear;    Velvet ears which, hanging low,    O'er the veiny temples flow.        JONATHAN SWIFT.            MERCY'S REWARD                          Hast seen    The record written of Salah-ud-Deen,    The Sultan--how he met, upon a day,    In his own city on the public way,    A woman whom they led to die? The veil    Was stripped from off her weeping face, and pale    Her shamed cheeks were, and wild her fixed eye,    And her lips drawn with terror at the cry    Of the harsh people, and the rugged stones    Borne in their hands to break her flesh and bones;    For the law stood that sinners such as she    Perish by stoning, and this doom must be;    So went the adult'ress to her death.    High noon it was, and the hot Khamseen's breath    Blew from the desert sands and parched the town.    The crows gasped, and the kine went up and down    With lolling tongues; the camels moaned; a crowd    Pressed with their pitchers, wrangling high and loud    About the tank; and one dog by a well,    Nigh dead with thirst, lay where he yelped and fell,    Glaring upon the water out of reach,    And praying succour in a silent speech,    So piteous were its eyes.                      Which, when she saw,    This woman from her foot her shoe did draw,    Albeit death-sorrowful, and, looping up    The long silk of her girdle, made a cup    Of the heel's hollow, and thus let it sink    Until it touched the cool black water's brink;    So filled th' embroidered shoe, and gave a draught    To the spent beast, which whined, and fawned, and quaffed    Her kind gift to the dregs; next licked her hand,    With such glad looks that all might understand    He held his life from her; then, at her feet    He followed close, all down the cruel street,    Her one friend in that city.                      But the King,    Riding within his litter, marked this thing,    And how the woman, on her way to die    Had such compassion for the misery    Of that parched hound: \"Take off her chain, and place    The veil once more about the sinner's face,    And lead her to her house in peace!\" he said.    \"The law is that the people stone thee dead    For that which thou hast wrought; but there is come    Fawning around thy feet a witness dumb,    Not heard upon thy trial; this brute beast    Testifies for thee, sister! whose weak breast    Death could not make ungentle. I hold rule    In Allah's stead, who is 'the Merciful,'    And hope for mercy; therefore go thou free--    I dare not show less pity unto thee.\"        As we forgive--and more than we--      Ya Barr! Good God, show clemency.        SIR EDWIN ARNOLD.            BEAU AND THE WATER LILY        The noon was shady, and soft airs      Swept Ouse's silent tide,    When 'scaped from literary cares      I wandered on his side.      My spaniel, prettiest of his race,      And high in pedigree    (Two nymphs adorned with every grace      That spaniel found for me)      Now wantoned, lost in flags and reeds,      Now starting into sight,    Pursued the swallow o'er the meads      With scarce a slower flight.      It was the time that Ouse displayed      His lilies newly blown;    Their beauties I intent surveyed,      And one I wished my own.      With cane extended far I sought      To steer it close to land;    But still the prize, though nearly caught,      Escaped my eager hand.      Beau marked my unsuccessful pains      With fixed, considerate face,    And puzzling, set his puppy brains      To comprehend the case.      But with a chirrup clear and strong      Dispersing all his dream,    I thence withdrew, and followed long      The windings of the stream.      My ramble ended, I returned;      Beau trotting far before    The floating wreath again discerned,      And, plunging, left the shore.      I saw him, with that lily cropped,      Impatient swim to meet    My quick approach, and soon he dropped      The treasure at my feet.      Charmed with the sight, \"The world,\" I cried,      \"Shall hear of this thy deed;    My dog shall mortify the pride      Of man's superior breed:      \"But chief myself I will enjoin      Awake at duty's call,    To show a love as prompt as thine      To Him who gives me all.\"        WILLIAM COWPER.
