They were again in great Distress, in not knowing      where _Dunholme_ lay; but as they proceeded, a Woman wanting her      Cow, called aloud to her Companion, to know if she had seen her? Who      answered, She was in _Dunholme_. This was an happy and heavenly      Sound to the distressed Monks, who thereby had Intelligence that      their Journey's End was at Hand, and the Saint's Body near its      Resting-place; thereupon with great Joy they arrived with his      Body at _Dunholme_, in the Year 997.\"    [Illustration: The Dun Cow.]    Arrived at Dunholm they raised a \"little Church of Wands and Branches\"  to protect the sacred relics until a building more worthy of such a  charge could be erected. This was the beginning of the Cathedral and  City of Durham.    The condition of the place at this time must have been very wild, and it  certainly was a natural stronghold. The only open spot seems to have  been the plateau where the cathedral now stands. The site is curiously  described in a Saxon poem, from which the following is a translation:--      The City is celebrated    In the whole Empire of the Britons    The road to it is steep    It is surrounded with rocks    And with curious plants    The Wear flows round it    A river of rapid waves    And there live in it    Fishes of various kinds    Mingling with the floods.    And there grow    Great Forests,    There live in the recesses    Wild Animals of many sorts    In the deep valleys    Deer innumerable.    As soon as possible a stone chapel was built, in which the body of S.  Cuthbert was placed. Bishop Aldhun, not satisfied with this, determined  to establish a great church. Work was immediately commenced and  progressed so rapidly that the building, known as \"the White Church,\"  was consecrated in A.D. 999. Of this there would seem to be no authentic  remains existing; although some authorities think portions of it are  included in the present cathedral. Bishop Aldhun died in 1018. The next  date of importance is the year 1081, when William of Saint Carileph was  appointed Bishop by the Conqueror. He was a monk of the Benedictine  order, and at once drove out and dispossessed the secular clergy at  Durham, replacing them from the Benedictine Monasteries which were  established at Jarrow and Monkwearmouth. Bishop Carileph is the man to  whom we owe the present Cathedral of Durham. In 1088 he was obliged to  flee into exile in Normandy, where he remained three years, through his  having taken part in the rebellion against William II. It was probably  during this time of banishment that he conceived the idea that if he  returned to Durham he would build a more worthy church, such as were  already erected and in course of construction in Normandy.    Soon after his return in 1091 he commenced to carry out his scheme; and  we learn that on the 11th of August 1093, the foundation stone of the  new church was laid, with great pomp.    The work proceeded rapidly, commencing at the east end. By the time of  Bishop Carileph's death, which occurred in 1096, the walls of the choir,  the eastern walls of the transepts, the tower arches, and a portion of  the first bay of the nave, were completed. It is also very probable that  the lower portion of the walls of the whole church are of Carileph's  time.    After the death of Bishop Carileph the see of Durham remained vacant for  three years. The monks, however, were not idle during this period, and  they continued the work vigorously, completing the west walls of the  transepts and the vaulting of the north transept. In 1099 Ralph Flambard  was appointed bishop, and he held the office until 1128. He carried on  the building as the funds at his disposal would allow, sometimes rapidly  and at others more slowly. Before his death it would appear that he  completed the nave as high as the wall plates and altogether finished  and roofed the aisles. The western towers as far as the height of the  roof of the nave are also the work of Flambard. In 1104 the work was so  far advanced as to permit the removal of the body of S. Cuthbert, from  the temporary shrine which Bishop Carileph had erected over it, into the  new church. This ceremony was performed on August 29th, 1104, and the  coffin was placed in a shrine behind the high altar.    On Flambard's death in 1128 the see was again left vacant for five  years, but we are told that the monks continued the work and completed  the nave. The portion built by them at this time must of necessity have  been the vaulting and roof, the architectural features of which are  quite in accordance with the date, being late Norman.    Flambard's successor was Galfrid Rufus, who was Bishop from 1133 to  1140.    During his episcopate the chapter-house, which had been commenced by  the monks, was completed. Rufus also replaced the then existing north  and south doorways of the nave, by those standing to-day.    The next bishop, William de St Barbara (1143 to 1152), does not appear  to have added anything to the cathedral. During his time of office the  see was usurped by William Cummin, and building operations were no doubt  neglected through the troubles arising from the usurpation. His  successor, Hugh Pudsey (1153 to 1195) was, however, a great builder;  appointed to the see at a comparatively early age, and, living as he  did, at a time when very great changes were taking place in  architectural style, he was able to carry out a great deal of beautiful  work.    He began to build a Lady Chapel at the east end of the choir, but  although he had made careful preparations, and engaged skilled  architects and workmen, great cracks appeared in the walls before the  work had proceeded far, and the building was stopped. Bishop Pudsey,  taking this as a divine revelation that the work was not pleasing to  God, and the patron S. Cuthbert, abandoned it and commenced another  chapel at the west end of the church, using in its erection the Purbeck  marble bases and columns which he had had prepared for his eastern  chapel. This second attempt was successful and remains to us in that  beautiful and unique specimen of Transitional work, the Galilee Chapel.  Its date may be taken, says Canon Greenwell, \"as about the year 1175.\"  Besides this work Pudsey built the hall and solar now called (at the  top) the \"Norman Gallery\" of Durham Castle.    Little or nothing further seems to have been done until the translation  of Bishop Poore from the see of Sarum to Durham in 1229. The name of  Bishop Poore is inseparably connected with the building of the present  Salisbury Cathedral, and after his removal to Durham he conceived the  idea of, and made preparations for, commencing the eastern transept of  the Cathedral, which is a special feature of Durham, now known as the  Chapel of the Nine Altars. He was not, however, destined to live to see  his idea carried out.    The eastern termination of Carileph's choir had been apsidal; it was  found to be in a very unsafe condition, cracks and fissures appearing in  the walls. Various bishops and priors sent aid towards \"the new work,\"  but actual building did not commence until after the death of Bishop  Poore in 1237. The erection was commenced by Prior Melsanby and, of  course, necessitated the taking down of Carileph's apses. The revaulting  of the choir was undertaken at this time, doubtless, for artistic  reasons, to bring the new work into harmony with the old. The Chapel of  the Nine Altars is a rare and valuable specimen of Early English Gothic  architecture of remarkable and graceful design. Below each of its nine  lancet windows was originally an altar, dedicated to different saints.  Its great height was obtained by lowering the floor, so that the unity  of the whole exterior should not be destroyed. Prior Melsanby is also  said to have put a new roof on the church.    Prior Hugh de Derlington, who was at the head of affairs from 1258 to  1272, and later from 1285 to 1289, added a belfry to the central tower.    John Fossor, made prior of Durham in 1342, inserted the large window in  the north transept and the west windows of the nave.    Bishop Thomas de Hatfield (1346 to 1381) seems to have done no  architectural work beyond the erection of his own throne and tomb (in  which he was afterwards buried) on the south side of the choir. This is  an elaborate and sumptuous piece of work, and shows remains of rich  colouring and gilding. About this time, also, the beautiful altar screen  known as the Neville screen was erected. Its cost was principally borne  by Lord John Neville, though the Priors Fossor and Berrington and the  subordinate cells of Jarrow and Monkwearmouth were also contributors.  The screen is of stone--very light and graceful, and originally  contained in the niches 107 figures, which have unfortunately been  destroyed.    Bishop Walter de Skirlaw, who occupied the episcopal throne from 1388 to  1405, was a great builder. To him mainly we owe the present cloisters,  though they were completed by his successor, Cardinal Langley, in 1418.    The monks' dormitory on the western side of the cloister is also of this  time. On the southern side was the refectory. This portion was rebuilt  by Dean Sudbury between 1661 and 1684 and converted into a library, and  such it remains to-day.    Near the refectory is the kitchen,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20194"],[0,"The Petticoat Commando: Boer Women in Secret Service (#3)"],[1,"oss,\" or rug,  made of the skins of wild South African animals. Nothing was seen of  him again, but Mrs. van Warmelo immediately got a revolver and kept  watch for him, hoping, yet fearing, that he would return for more  plunder.    This was a sad beginning, and old Anne added to their fears by  predicting every imaginable calamity to the inhabitants of Harmony.  She was gifted with second-sight, so she said, and often saw a man in  grey about the place; his presence \"boded no good,\" and old Anne soon  after left the place, with many warnings to her mistress to follow her  example, before she could be overtaken by disaster.    All this had taken place long before the war broke out. Harmony had in  the meantime been vastly improved, the dense undergrowth having been  cut away, and the row of enormous willow trees, with which the house  was overshadowed, having been removed, while large flower and  vegetable gardens had been laid out, where once a jungle-like growth  of shrubs and rank grass had abounded.    Much of the natural beauty still remained, however, and Harmony was a  favourite resort for many people in Pretoria. Young and old visited  the place, especially during the summer months when the garden was  laden with its wealth of fruit and flowers; and of these friends of  the family many figure in these pages, while some do not appear at  all, having had no part in the stirring events with which this book  deals.    Amongst the most frequent visitors at Harmony were the Consul-General  for the Netherlands, Mr. Domela-Nieuwenhuis and his wife, and other  members of the Diplomatic Corps with their families.    These friendships had been formed before the war, and it was only  natural that they should have been strengthened and deepened by the  trying circumstances of the years during which the country was  convulsed by such unspeakable tragedies.    Although the position held by these men debarred them from taking any  part whatsoever in the events of the war, their sympathies were  undoubtedly with the people of South Africa. They suffered with and  for their friends, and they must frequently have been weighed down by  a sense of their powerlessness to alleviate the distress around them,  which they were forced to witness; but they were, without exception,  men of high integrity, and observed with strict honour the obligations  laid upon them by their position of trust.    Needless to say, they were not aware of the conspiracies which were  carried on at Harmony; to this day they are ignorant of the dangers to  which the van Warmelos were exposed and the hazardous nature of many  of the enterprises in which mother and daughter were engaged, and I  look forward with delight to the privilege of presenting each of these  gentlemen with a copy of this book, in which they will find so many  revelations of an unexpected and startling nature.    It is not my intention to go into the details of the first encounters  with the enemy, nor to describe the siege-comedy of Mafeking, where  Baden-Powell, as principal actor, maintained a humorous correspondence  with the Boers; nor of Kimberley, where Cecil Rhodes said he felt as  safe as in Piccadilly; nor of Dundee, where the Boers were said to  have found a large number of brand-new side-saddles, originally  destined to be used by British officers on arrival at the capital,  where they hoped to take the ladies of Pretoria riding, but ultimately  consigned to the flames by the indignant brothers and lovers of those  very ladies; nor of the fine linen, silver, cut-glass, and fingerbowls  found and destroyed by the Boers in the luxurious British camp at  Dundee. I shall not dwell upon the glorious victories of the first  months, the capture of armoured trains, the blowing up of bridges, the  besieging of towns, the arrival in Pretoria of the first British  prisoners and the long sojourn of British officers in captivity in the  Model School--from where, incidentally, Winston Churchill escaped in  an ingenious way--and the crushing news of the first Boer reverses at  Dundee and Elandslaagte.    Are these historical events not fully recorded in other books, by  other writers more competent than myself?    A three-volume book would hardly contain the experiences Hansie had,  first in the Volks Hospital in Pretoria and later in the State Girls'  School, as volunteer nurse, but I shall pass over the events of the  first eight months of war under Boer martial law and introduce my  reader to that period in May 1900 shortly before the British took  possession of the capital.    The two remaining brothers van Warmelo were at this time retreating  with the now completely demoralised Boer forces, before the terrific  onslaughts made upon them by the enemy.    Blow after blow was delivered by the English in quiet succession on  their forced march from Bloemfontein to Pretoria, and it was on May  25th that the roar of Boer cannon reached the capital for the first  time.    Looking south-east from Harmony, Mrs. and Miss van Warmelo were able  to watch the Boer commandos pouring into the town--_straggling_ would  be a better word, for there was no one in command, and the weary men  on their jaded horses passed in groups of twos and threes, and in  small contingents of from fifty to a hundred.    Mrs. van Warmelo fully expected to see her sons among the number and  made preparations to welcome them, for under the roar of cannon the  fatted turkey had been killed and roasted and a large plum-pudding  made.    Suddenly two men on horseback turned out of the wayside and rode  straight up to the gate.    \"Perhaps these men are bringing us news of our boys,\" Mrs. van Warmelo  said to her daughter, who was watching them with anxiety at her heart.    The men dismounted at the gate and walked up to the two women, leading  their horses slowly over the grass.    No one spoke until the men were a few yards off, when Hansie  exclaimed, with unbounded joy and relief, \"Why, they _are_ our boys!\"    With unkempt hair and long beards, covered with dust, tattered and  weary, no wonder mother and sister failed to recognise them at first!    When the first greetings were over, the young men gave what news they  could--stupefying news of the advance of the enemy in overwhelming  numbers, and of the flight and confusion of what remained of the Boer  forces.    \"What are you going to do?\" their mother asked.    \"Rest and feed our horses first of all, mother,\" Dietlof, the elder,  replied. \"They are worn out and unfit for use. And when we have  equipped ourselves for whatever may be in store for us, we must join  some small commando and escape from the town. Little or no resistance  is being offered by our men, and it is evident that Pretoria will not  be defended. All we can do is to escape before the English take  possession.\"    Mrs. van Warmelo then told her sons of the retreat of the President  from the capital, with the entire Government, by the eastern railway  route.    The greatest consternation had been caused by this flight at first,  but subsequent events went to prove that this was the wisest course  which could have been pursued.    In this decision the President had been urged by his wife, and Mrs.  van Warmelo went on to tell how the brave old lady had said to her in  an expressive way, on the occasion of her last visit at the  President's house:    \"My dear friend, do not fear. No Englishman will ever lay his hand on  the coat-tails of the President.\"    It is quite impossible to describe the confusion that ensued during  the next few days.    No one knew what to do; there were no organised Boer forces to join,  there was no one in command, and, after long deliberation, the two  young men, urged by mother and sister, came to the conclusion that,  whatever other men might be doing, _their_ duty was to get out of  Pretoria and join whatever band of fighting burghers there might still  be in the field.    The same spirit of determination not to fall into the hands of the  enemy while the Boer Government was free, and could continue  organising the war, prevailed amongst most of the men in Pretoria, and  daily small parties could be seen leaving the town, in carts, on  horseback, on bicycles, and even on foot. Where they were going and  when they would return no one knew.    On the morning of June 4th, the necessary preparations for the  departure of the young men having been made, as they were sitting at  what proved to be their last meal together for such long and terrible  years, they were suddenly startled by the sound of cannon-firing and  the whistling of a shell through the air.    They listened, speechless, as the shell burst on Schanskop Fort, on  the Sunnyside hill, just beyond Harmony, with an explosion that shook  the house.    It was followed by another and yet another.    So little were the inhabitants of Pretoria prepared for this that  everyone at first thought that the shells were being fired, for some  unaccountable reason, by the Boers, from the Pretoria Forts, until a  few of them burst so close to the houses that the fragments of rock  and shell fell like hail on the iron roofs. The other members of the  family followed Mrs. van Warmelo into the garden: and when it became  evident that the enemy was bombarding the Pretoria Forts, the two  young men immediately saddled their horses and rode out in the  direction in which they thought it most likely that some resistance  would be offered, after having advised their mother and sister to flee  to some place of refuge in the centre of the town.    There was no doubt that Harmony was directly in the line of fire, and  as the great shells went shrieking and hurtling through the air, the  very earth seemed to shake with the force of each explosion.    Mrs. van Warmelo hastily packed a few valuables into a hand-bag, and  fled into town with her daughter, leaving their dinner standing almost  untouched on the table. On their way to"]]]
