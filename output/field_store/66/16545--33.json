The child was in a  state of extreme weakness, but, by means of a little care, he was in a  short time restored to his usual vigor.    [Illustration: THE CHILD DISCOVERED BY THE INDIAN'S DOG.]    In one of the churches at Lambeth, England, there is a painting on a  window, representing a man with his dog. There is a story connected with  this painting which is worth telling. Tradition informs us that a piece  of ground near Westminster bridge, containing a little over an acre, was  left to that parish by a pedler, upon condition that his picture,  accompanied by his dog, should be faithfully painted on the glass of one  of the windows. The parishioners, as the story goes, had this picture  executed accordingly, and came in possession of the land. This was in  the year 1504. The property rented at that time for about a dollar a  year. It now commands a rent of nearly fifteen hundred dollars. The  reason given for the pedler's request is, that he was once very poor,  when, one day, having occasion to pass across this piece of ground, and  being weary, he sat down under a tree to rest. While seated here, he  noticed that his dog, who was with him, acted strangely. At a distance  of several rods from the place where he sat, the dog busied himself for  awhile in scratching at a particular spot of earth, after which he  returned to his master, looked earnestly up to his face, and endeavored  to draw him toward the spot where he had been digging. The pedler,  however, paid but little attention to the movements of the dog, until he  had repeated them several times, when he was induced to accompany the  dog. To his surprise he found, on doing so, that there was a pot of gold  buried there. With a part of this gold he purchased the lot of ground on  which it had been discovered, and bequeathed it to the parish on the  conditions mentioned above. The pedler and his dog are represented in  the picture which ornaments the window of that church. \"But is the story  a true one?\" methinks I hear my little friends inquire. I confess it has  the air of one of Baron Munchausen's yarns, and I am somewhat doubtful  about it. But that is the tradition in the Lambeth parish, where the  picture may still be seen by any body who takes the trouble to visit the  place. The story may be true. Stranger things have happened.    Those who have studied geography do not need to be informed that there  is a chain of high mountains running through Switzerland, called the  Alps. The tops of some of these mountains are covered with snow nearly  all the year. In the winter it is very difficult and dangerous traveling  over the Alps; for the snow frequently rolls down the sides of the  mountain, in a great mass, called an _avalanche_, and buries the  traveler beneath it. On one of these mountains there is the convent of  St. Bernard. It is situated ten thousand feet above the base of the  mountain, and is on one of the most dangerous passes between Switzerland  and Savoy. It is said to be the highest inhabited spot in the old world.  It is tenanted by a race of monks, who are very kind to travelers. Among  other good services they render to the strangers who pass near their  convent, they search for unhappy persons who have been overtaken by  sudden storms, and who are liable to perish.    These monks have a peculiar variety of the dog, called the dog of St.  Bernard, or the Alpine Spaniel, which they train to hunt for travelers  who are overtaken by a storm, and who are in danger of perishing. The  dog of St. Bernard is one of the most sagacious of his species. He is  covered with thick, curly hair, which is frequently of great service in  warming the traveler, when he is almost dead with cold.    One of these dogs, named Barry, had, it was reckoned, in twelve years  saved the lives of forty individuals. Whenever the mountain was  enveloped in fogs and snow, away scoured Barry, barking and searching  all about for any person who might have fallen a victim to the storm.  When he was successful in finding any one, if his own strength was  insufficient to rescue him, he would run back to the convent in search  of assistance.    I think I must translate for my young readers an affecting story about  this dog Barry, which I read the other day in a little French book,  entitled \"Modeles des Enfans.\" It seems that a great while ago there was  a poor woman wandering about these mountains, in the vicinity of the  convent of St. Bernard, in company with her son, a very small boy. The  story does not inform us what they were doing, and why they were walking  in such a dangerous place. Perhaps they were gathering fuel to keep them  warm; and very likely when they left home the weather was mild, and that  they did not anticipate a storm. However that may be, they were  overtaken by an avalanche, the mother was buried beneath it, and the  child saw her no more. But I must tell the remainder of the story in the  language of the French writer.    [Illustration: THE DOG OF ST. BERNARD, RESCUING THE CHILD.]    \"Poor boy! the storm increased; the wind howled, and whirled the snow  into huge heaps. In the hope that he might possibly meet a traveler, the  child forced his way for awhile through the snow; but at last,  exhausted, benumbed with the cold, and discouraged, he fell upon his  knees, joined his hands devoutly together, and cried, as he raised his  face, bathed in tears, toward heaven, 'O my God! have mercy on a poor  child, who has nobody in the world to care for him!' As he lay in the  place where he fell down, which was sheltered a little by a rock, he  grew colder and colder, and he thought he must die. But still, from time  to time, he prayed, 'Have mercy, O my God! on a poor child, who has  nobody in the world to care for him!' At last he fell asleep, but was  wakened by feeling a warm paw on his face. As he opened his eyes he saw  with terror an enormous dog holding his head near his own. He uttered a  cry of fear, and started back a little way from the dog. The dog  approached the boy again, and tried, after his own fashion, to make the  little fellow understand that he came there to do him good, and not to  hurt him. Then he licked the face and hands of the child. By and by the  child confided in his visitor, and began to entertain a hope that he  might yet be saved. When Barry saw that his errand was understood, he  lifted his head, and showed the child a bottle covered with willow,  which was hanging around his neck. This bottle contained wine, some of  which the little fellow drank, and felt refreshed. Then the dog lay down  by the side of the child, and gave him the benefit of the heat of his  own body for a long time. After this, the dog made a sign for the boy to  get upon his back. It was some time before the boy could understand what  the sign meant. But it was repeated again and again, and at last the  child mounted the back of the kind animal, who carried him safely to the  convent.\"    Here is a capital story about a bloodhound, taken from the excellent  book by Mr. Bingley, to which I have before alluded. Aubri de Mondidier,  a gentleman of family and fortune, traveling alone through the Forest of  Bondy, in France, was murdered, and buried under a tree. His dog, a  bloodhound, would not quit his master's grave for several days; till at  length, compelled by hunger, he proceeded to the house of an intimate  friend of the unfortunate Aubri at Paris, and, by his melancholy  howling, seemed desirous of expressing the loss they had both sustained.  He repeated his cries, ran to the door, looked back to see if any one  followed him, returned to his master's friend, pulled him by the  sleeve, and with dumb eloquence, entreated him to go with him. The  singularity of all these actions of the dog, added to the circumstance  of his coming there without his master, whose faithful companion he had  always been, prompted the company to follow the animal. He conducted  them to the foot of a tree, where he renewed his howling, scratching the  earth with his feet, and significantly entreating them to search the  particular spot. Accordingly, on digging, the body of the unhappy Aubri  was found.    [Illustration: THE BLOODHOUND]    Some time after, the dog accidentally met the assassin, who is styled,  by all the historians who relate the story, the Chevalier Macaire, when,  instantly seizing him by the throat, he was with great difficulty  compelled to quit his victim. In short, whenever the dog saw the  chevalier, he continued to pursue and attack him with equal fury. Such  obstinate violence, confined only to Macaire, appeared very  extraordinary, especially to those who at once recalled the dog's  remarkable attachment to his master, and several instances in which  Macaire's envy and hatred to Aubri de Mondidier had been conspicuous.    Additional circumstances increased suspicion, and at length the affair  reached the royal ear. The king accordingly sent for the dog, which  appeared extremely gentle, till he perceived Macaire in the midst of  several noblemen, when he ran fiercely toward him, growling at and  attacking him, as usual. Struck with such a combination of  circumstantial evidence against Macaire, the king determined to refer  the decision to the chance of battle; or, in other words, he gave orders  for a combat between the chevalier and the dog. The lists were appointed  in the Isle of Notre Dame, then an unenclosed, uninhabited place.  Macaire was allowed for his weapon a great cudgel, and an empty cask was  given to the dog as a place of retreat, to enable him to recover breath.    Every thing being prepared, the dog no sooner found himself at liberty,  than he made for his adversary, running round him and menacing him on  every side, avoiding his blows till his strength was exhausted; then  springing forward, he seized him by the throat, threw him on the ground,  and obliged him to "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18779"],[0,"Physiology and Hygiene for Secondary Schools (#3)"],[1,"the body as a whole. In other words, just as the organ  itself is a part of the body, the work which it does is a part of the  necessary work which the body has to do.    But in working for the general good, or for the body as a whole, each  organ becomes a sharer in the benefits of the work done by every other  organ. While the hand receives only a little of the nourishment contained  in the food which it places in the mouth or of the heat from, fuel which  it places on the fire, it is aided and supported by the work of all the  other organs of the body--eyes,  feet, brain, heart, etc. The hand does not  and cannot work independently of the other organs. It is one of the  partners in a very close combination where, by doing a particular work,  it, shares in the profits of all. What is true of the hand is true of  every other organ of the body.    *An Organization.*--The relations which the different organs sustain to  each other and to the body as a whole suggest the possibility of  classifying the body as an organization. This term is broadly applied to a  variety of combinations. An organization is properly defined as _any group  of individuals which, in working together for a common purpose, practices  the division of labor_. This definition will be better understood by  considering a few familiar examples.    A baseball team is an organization. The team is made up of individual  players. These work together for the common purpose of winning games. They  practice the division of labor in that the different players do different  things--one catching, another pitching, and so on. A manufacturing  establishment which employs several workmen may also be an organization.  The article manufactured provides the common purpose toward which all  strive; and, in the assignment of different kinds of work to the  individual workmen, the principle of division of labor is carried out. For  the same reason a school, a railway system, an army, and a political party  are organizations.    An organization of a lower order of individuals than these human  organizations is to be found in a hive of bees. This is made up of the  individual bees, and these, in carrying on the general work of the hive,  are known to practice the division of labor.    *Is the Body an Organization*?--If the body is an organization, it must  fulfill the conditions of the definition. It must be made up of separate  or individual parts. These must work together for the same general  purpose, and, in the accomplishment of this purpose, must practice the  division of labor. That the body practices the division of labor is seen  in the related work of the different organs. That it is made up of minute,  but individual, parts will be shown in the chapter following. That it  carries on a _general work_ which is accomplished through the combined  action of its individual parts is revealed through an extended study of  its various activities. _The body is an organization._ Moreover, it is one  of the most complex and, at the same time, most perfect of the  organizations of which we have knowledge.    *Summary.*--Viewed from the outside, the body is seen to be made up of  divisions which are more or less familiar. Viewed internally, it is found  to consist of different kinds of materials, called tissues. The tissues  are adapted, by their properties, to different purposes both in the  construction of the body and in carrying on its work. The working parts of  the body are called organs and these in their work combine to form  systems. The entire body, on account of the method of its construction and  the character of its work, may be classed as an organization.    *Exercises.*--1. Name and locate the chief external divisions of the body.    2. What tissues may be found by dissecting the leg of a chicken?    3. Name the most important properties and the most important uses of  muscular tissue, osseous tissue, and connective tissue.    4. Define an organ. Define a system. Name examples of each.    5. Name the chief cavities of the body and the organs which they contain.    6. What tissues are present in the hand? How does each of these aid in the  work of the hand?    7. Define an organization. Show that a railway system, an army, and a  school are organizations.    8. What is meant by the phrase \"division of labor\"? In what manner is the  division of labor practiced in a shoe or watch factory? What are the  advantages?    9. What are the proofs that the body is an organization?        PRACTICAL WORK      *Observation on the Tissues.*--Examine with care the structures in the  entire leg of a chicken, squirrel, rabbit, or other small animal used for  food. Observe, first of all, the external covering, consisting of cuticle  and hair, claws, scales, or feathers, according to the specimen. These are  similar in structure, and they form the epidermis, which is one kind of  _epithelial_ tissue. With a sharp knife lay open the skin and observe that  it is attached to the parts underneath by thin, but tough, threads and  sheaths. These represent a variety of _connective_ tissue. The reddish  material which forms the greater portion of the specimen is a variety of  _muscular_ tissue, and its divisions are called muscles. With a blunt  instrument, separate the muscles, by tearing apart the connective tissue  binding them together, and find the glistening white strips of connective  tissue (tendons) which attach them to the bones. Find near the central  part of the leg a soft, white cord (a nerve) which represents one variety  of _nervous_ tissue. The bones, which may now be examined, form the  _osseous_ tissue. At the ends of the bones will be found a layer of  smooth, white material which represents one kind of _cartilaginous_  tissue. The _adipose_, or fatty, tissue, which is found under the skin and  between the other tissues, is easily recognized.    *Relation of the Tissues to the Organs.*--Observe in the specimen just  studied the relation of the different tissues to the organ as a whole  (regarding the leg as an organ), _i.e._, show how each of the tissues aids  in the work which the organ accomplishes. Show in particular how the  muscles supply the foot with motion, by tracing out the tendons that  connect them with the toes. Pull on the different tendons, noting the  effect upon the different parts of the foot.          CHAPTER III - THE BODY ORGANIZATION      What is the nature of the body organization? What are the individual  parts, or units, that make it up? What general work do these carry on and  upon what basis do they practice the division of labor? The answers to  these questions will suggest the main problems in the study of the body.                                     [Fig. 3]        Fig. 3--Diagram showing the relation of the cells and the intercellular              material. _C._ Cells. _I._ Intercellular material.      *Complex Nature of the Tissues.*--To the unaided eye the tissues have the  appearance of simple structures. The microscope, however, shows just the  reverse to be true. When any one of the tissues is suitably prepared and  carefully examined with this instrument, at least two classes of materials  can be made out. One of these consists of minute particles, called  _cells_; the other is a substance lying between the cells, known as the  _intercellular material_ (Fig. 3). The cells and the intercellular  material, though varying in their relative proportions, are present in all  the tissues.    *The Body a Cell Group.*--The biologist has found that the bodies of all  living things, plants as well as animals, consist either of single cells  or of groups of cells. The single cells live independently of one another,  but the cells that form groups are attached to, and are more or less  dependent upon, one another. In the first condition are found the very  lowest forms of life. In the second, life reaches its greatest  development. The body of man, which represents the highest type of life,  is recognized as a group of cells. In this group each cell is usually  separate and distinct from the others, but is attached to them, and is  held in place by the intercellular material.    *Protoplasm, the Cell Substance.*--The cell is properly regarded as an  _organized_ bit of a peculiar material, called _protoplasm_. This is a  semi-liquid and somewhat granular substance which resembles in appearance  the white of a raw egg. Its true nature and composition are unknown,  because any attempt to analyze it kills it, and dead protoplasm is  essentially different from living protoplasm. It is known, however, to be  a highly complex substance and to undergo chemical change readily. It  appears to be the only kind of matter with which life is ever associated,  and for this reason protoplasm is called the _physical basis of life_. Its  organization into separate bits, or cells, is necessary to the life  activities that take place within it.    *Structure of the Cell.*--Though all portions of the cell are formed from  the protoplasm, this essential substance differs both in structure and in  function at different places in the cell. For this reason the cell is  looked upon as a complex body having several distinct parts. At or near  the center is a clear, rounded body, called the _nucleus_. This plays some  part in the nourishment of the cell and also in the formation of new  cells. If it be absent, as is sometimes the case, the cell is short-lived  and unable to reproduce itself. The variety of protoplasm contained in the  nucleus is called the _nucleoplasm_.                                     [Fig. 4]      Fig. 4--Diagram of a typical cell (after Wilson). 1. Main body. 2.
