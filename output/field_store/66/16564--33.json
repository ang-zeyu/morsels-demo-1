[Illustration: PLATE 2a]          Op. III      The following plates were sketched from an old strip of work done in  deep indigo worsted wool, with a rather lighter wool, both in colour and  make, used in the fine buttonhole work and darning, of which there is  much throughout the work. The design was a branching one, the flowers  and leaves--most of which appear in the following plates--are hanging  from stems about a quarter of an inch thick done in herring-bone stitch,  with the exception of the violas (plate 5) which have a thicker stem of  their own in herring-bone, stem stitch and loops. The thistles (plate 3,  No. 1) reproduced the same size as in the work, were scattered about in  groups of three, making a very pleasing contrast to the hanging roses  (plate 6), whilst the irises reared their heads all along the bottom of  the strip, but owing to the work having been cut, it was impossible to  see how they joined their straight stalks to the branching ones above.    PLATE 3    No. 1. Stem stitch contour: diaper work done in coral stitch, with a  French knot filling in each alternate square. Four rows of buttonhole  stitch at top of flower.    No. 2. Stem-stitch, coral stitch and darning.    No. 3. Buttonhole stitch, French knot and stem stitch.    No. 4. Stem stitch and buttonhole stitch.    No. 5. Coral stitch. (These tendrils occurred all over the work and were  very effective.)    No. 6. Buttonhole stitch: centre and stalk in stem stitch.    No. 7. Stem stitch and loops.    [Illustration: PLATE 3]      PLATE 4    The iris shown here was worked as follows: The contours in stem stitch  throughout. The centre and two side petals have stem stitch veins, edged  buttonhole stitch and were filled in with big knots. The smaller petals  were partially filled in with buttonhole stitch and darning. The dark  petal on left was done in Cretan[3] stitch edged stem stitch.    [3] A variation of herring bone stitch.    [Illustration: PLATE 4]      PLATE 5    No. 1. Contour in stem stitch, filled in lightly with buttonhole stitch,  and darning and long-and-short stitch.    No. 2. Ditto, with the addition of herring-bone stitch on two upper  petals.    No. 3. (Stalk) herring-bone stem stitch with loops between.    [Illustration: PLATE 5]      PLATE 6    No. 1. Stem-stitch, buttonhole stitch and darning.    No. 2. Ditto.    No. 3. Stem stitch, buttonhole stitch, French knots and darning.    No. 4. Stem stitch, buttonhole stitch and darning.    All have herring-bone stitch stalks.         Sketched from a piece of work in blue crewels on white linen,       belonged to the late Lady Maria Ponsonby.    [Illustration: PLATE 6]      PLATE 7    Most of the stitchery shown here is similar to that on the preceding  plates, but has the addition of the plait stitch[4] edged with  buttonhole stitch in the veins of the big leaf, and the close knots on  the sheaf of the foxgloves, while the sheaf of the convolvulus has veins  of stem stitch and small French knots.    In all this piece of work there is to be noted a great deal of  buttonholing and darning.    [4] A variation of herring-bone stitch.    [Illustration: PLATE 7]          Op. IV    PLATE 8      Shows many uses to which stem stitch can be put, which is the only  stitch employed in the work illustrated here, if we except the little  arrow-heads used to edge the vine leaf.    [Illustration: PLATE 8]    The following sketches were taken from a most beautiful and elaborate  strip of work, forming part of some bed-hangings, dated A.D. 1696,  worked in hard twisted crewels in blue, mignonette, and green colourings  only.      PLATE 9    treats of button-holeing stitch done in a variety of ways.    No. 1 has groups of three button-hole stitches and crosses in centre,  and is edged by chain stitch and arrow-heads.    No. 2. Button-hole stitch centre and edge.    No. 3. Button-hole stitch with stalks in stem stitch.    [Illustration: PLATE 9]      PLATE 10    In this sketch are three principal stitches, viz.: Chain stitch filling  in spaces Nos. 1-2 (on left of sketch) and forming the contour of the  whole leaf; button-hole stitch filling spaces Nos. 3-4; and a lace  stitch filling spaces Nos. 5-6-7. The other two spaces are filled by  brick stitch, and darning with little veins of coral stitch and herring  bone. There are loop stitches in the centre of the veining in spaces  6-7, and these are also worked round the outside of the leaf.    [Illustration: PLATE 10]      PLATE 10a    This leaf, having a contour of chain stitch, is filled in at the top  with a brown and blue branch in stem stitch, edged with short-and-long  stitch. The green turnover is in chain stitch with blue chain stitch  veins, and the blue turnovers at base of leaf are done in a lace surface  stitch, while the rest is filled in with small darning stitches, coral  stitches and a little bit of button-hole stitching. The three central  leaves crossing stem are in red and green, and blue and green; the brown  stalks are worked in stem stitch. Loops are worked round the outside of  the leaf here as in all the bigger leaves on this work. The spike on the  left of the sketch is in herring bone stitch edged with arrow heads.    [Illustration: PLATE 10a]          Op. V      The following three plates are sketches from the bed hangings in the  \"Chapel\" room at Hardwicke Hall, Derbyshire--the property of the Duke of  Devonshire.      PLATE 11    Shows the full design, which is a repeating one, of the hangings. The  details of the stitchery will be found on the following plates.    [Illustration: PLATE 11]      PLATE 12    No. 1. One of the many conventional foliations in this design, carried  out in stem stitch, buttonhole and darning.    No. 2. Close chain stitch for the circles with herring bone for the  stalk running through them.    No. 3. The same stem as in foxgloves but with darning introduced up the  centre.    No. 4. The sheafs of the foxgloves are worked in crochet stitch edged  stem stitch.    The contours of flowers in back stitch, filled in short-and-long  stitches and darning.    [Illustration: PLATE 12]      PLATE 13    No. 1. Contour in chain stitch. Vein stem stitch edged two rows  short-and-long stitches and darning.    No. 2. Contour in _double_ chain stitch. Veins in knot stitch edged  darning. Loops in middle of centre vein.    No. 3. Contour in stem stitch; vein ditto, edged with two rows of  short-and-long stitches and darning.    No. 4. Contour in chain stitch, edged darning. Centre vein chain stitch.  Branching veins knot stitch outlined with darning stitches.    No. 5. Contour buttonhole stitch and darning. Veins knot stitch and  darning.    [Illustration: PLATE 13]          Op. Va      PLATE 14    A group of fillings in which darning plays an important part, the  backgrounds of two of the leaves were carried out in indigo, the  veinings were worked in solid rows of outline stitch in brown shading to  a lighter bronze green, the central vein in the upper leaf was in  chain-stitch in dark blue and the outline of leaf was carried out in two  rows of chain stitching in darkest indigo. The shamrock leaf has a  darned contour of double threads, the filling was in stem stitch, solid,  with bars of a darker colour worked across it. The little band at the  bottom of the group was a mixture of satin, chain, stem and French  knots.    [Illustration: PLATE 14]          Op. VI      The following sketch was done from bed hangings, the property of the  Earl of Powis, at Powis Castle.      PLATE 15    The design is a bold one of big leaves worked on the usual thick white  hand-made linen. Undoubtedly the wools used were green at the time of  working, but have now changed to beautiful shades of blue to indigo.  Each leaf throughout the work has a thick contour in rope stitch of the  four shades of the wool used, and the stem is most effective, done in  squares of Cretan stitch in the same four shades.    [Illustration: PLATE 15]          Op. VII    PLATE 16      This bold leaf is mainly carried out in block shading, but the colours  are unusual. Indigo for the outside edge, soft brown the central block,  and light green for the inner; in the second leaf the green is employed  only for the line of veining; the two leaves or sections on the  right-hand side are treated as follows--The upper one has outlines of  brown, between which blocks of \"buttonhole\" in indigo are worked, the  intervening spaces being simply decorated by a loop stitch in green  wool. The sprays are in satin stitch, which is one of the best for small  sprays to be worked solid.    [Illustration: PLATE 16]      PLATE 17    A very handsome leaf, in the working of which many stitches are  employed.    The curved scroll at the top is carried out in block shading in blue to  pale green; the curved section on the right is marked out in squares  filled alternately with satin stitches, with a simple French knot in  each square, and by a square trellis secured in the centre by a cross  stitch; the scroll below this is outlined in crewel stitch, and filled  with laid work or strands of wool thrown across from edge to edge and  couched by back stitches at the points of intersection.    The three leaves at the root of the stem are carried out in block  shading in shades of grey green, the leaf above is outlined in crewel  stitch and filled with fancy devices worked in buttonhole stitch with  darning background; the centre motive is a solid mass of French knots,  well raised and blue in colour. I have seen this same motive carried out  in three shades, the lightest group at the point, the darkest at the  back.

Written  frankly from the viewpoint of the United States and the Allies, it  visualizes the bloodiest and most destructive conflict of all the ages  from its remote causes to its glorious conclusion and beneficent  results. The world-shaking rise of new democracies is set forth, and the  enormous national and individual sacrifices producing that resurrection  of human equality are detailed.    Two ideals have been before us in the preparation of this necessary  work. These are simplicity and thoroughness. It is of no avail to  describe the greatest of human events if the description is so confused  that the reader loses interest. Thoroughness is an historical essential  beyond price. So it is that official documents prepared in many  instances upon the field of battle, and others taken from the files of  the governments at war, are the basis of this work. Maps and photographs  of unusual clearness and high authenticity illuminate the text. All that  has gone into war making, into the regeneration of the world, are herein  set forth with historical particularity. The stark horrors of Belgium,  the blighting terrors of chemical warfare, the governmental restrictions  placed upon hundreds of millions of civilians, the war sacrifices  falling upon all the civilized peoples of earth, are in these pages.    It is a book that mankind can well read and treasure.        CHAPTER I    A WAR FOR INTERNATIONAL FREEDOM    \"My FELLOW COUNTRYMEN: The armistice was signed this morning. Everything  for which America fought has been accomplished. The war thus comes to an  end.\"    Speaking to the Congress and the people of the United States, President  Wilson made this declaration on November 11, 1918. A few hours before he  made this statement, Germany, the empire of blood and iron, had agreed  to an armistice, terms of which were the hardest and most humiliating  ever imposed upon a nation of the first class. It was the end of a war  for which Germany had prepared for generations, a war bred of a  philosophy that Might can take its toll of earth's possessions, of human  lives and liberties, when and where it will. That philosophy involved  the cession to imperial Germany of the best years of young German  manhood, the training of German youths to be killers of men. It involved  the creation of a military caste, arrogant beyond all precedent, a caste  that set its strength and pride against the righteousness of democracy,  against the possession of wealth and bodily comforts, a caste that  visualized itself as part of a power-mad Kaiser's assumption that he and  God were to shape the destinies of earth.    When Marshal Foch, the foremost strategist in the world, representing  the governments of the Allies and the United States, delivered to the  emissaries of Germany terms upon which they might surrender, he brought  to an end the bloodiest, the most destructive and the most beneficent  war the world has known. It is worthy of note in this connection that  the three great wars in which the United States of America engaged have  been wars for freedom. The Revolutionary War was for the liberty of the  colonies; the Civil War was waged for the freedom of manhood and for the  principle of the indissolubility of the Union; the World War, beginning  1914, was fought for the right of small nations to self-government and  for the right of every country to the free use of the high seas.    More than four million American men were under arms when the conflict  ended. Of these, more than two million were upon the fields of France  and Italy. These were thoroughly trained in the"]]]
