Their  proceedings, indeed, were only consistent with absolute monarchy; but  were entirely suitable to the genius of the act on which they were  established; an act that at once gave the crown alone all the power  which had formerly been claimed by the popes, but which even these  usurping prelates had never been able fully to exercise without some  concurrence of the national clergy.    Whoever refused to take an oath acknowledging the queen's supremacy, was  incapacitated from holding any office; whoever denied the supremacy, or  attempted to deprive the queen of that prerogative, forfeited, for the  first offence, all his goods and chattels; for the second, was subjected  to the penalty of a praemunire; but the third offence was declared  treason. These punishments, however severe, were less rigorous than  those which were formerly, during the reigns of her father and brother,  inflicted in like cases.    A law was passed confirming all the statutes enacted in King Edward's  time with regard to religion:[*] the nomination of bishops was given  to the crown, without any election of the chapters: the queen was  empowered, on the vacancy of any see, to seize all the temporalities,  and to bestow on the bishop elect an equivalent in the impropriations  belonging to the crown. This pretended equivalent was commonly much  inferior in value; and thus the queen, amidst all her concern for  religion, followed the example of the preceding reformers in committing  depredations on the ecclesiastical revenues.    The bishops and all incumbents were prohibited from alienating their  revenues, and from letting leases longer than twenty-one years or three  lives. This law seemed to be meant for securing the property of the  church; but as an exception was left in favor of the crown, great abuses  still prevailed. It was usual for the courtiers, during this reign,  to make an agreement with a bishop or incumbent; and to procure a  fictitious alienation to the queen, who afterwards transferred the lands  to the person agreed on.[**] This method of pillaging the church was not  remedied till the beginning of James I. The present depression of the  clergy exposed them to all injuries; and the laity never stopped till  they had reduced the church to such poverty, that her plunder was no  longer a compensation for the odium incurred by it.    A solemn and public disputation was held during this session in presence  of Lord Keeper Bacon, between the divines of the Protestant and those of  the Catholic communion. The champions appointed to defend the religion  of the sovereign were, as in all former instances, entirely triumphant;  and the Popish disputants, being pronounced refractory and obstinate,  were even punished by imprisonment.[***]         * I Eliz. cap. 2.         ** Strype, vol. i. p. 79.         *** Strype, vol. i. p. 95.    Emboldened by this victory, the Protestants ventured on the last  and most important step, and brought into parliament a bill[*] for  abolishing the mass and reestablishing the liturgy of King Edward.  Penalties were enacted, as well against those who departed from this  mode of worship, as against those who absented themselves from the  church and the sacraments. And thus in one session, without any  violence, tumult, or clamor, was the whole system of religion altered,  on the very commencement of a reign, and by the will of a young woman,  whose title to the crown was by many thought liable to objections; an  event which, though it may appear surprising to men in the present  age, was every where expected on the first intelligence of Elizabeth's  accession.    The commons also made a sacrifice to the queen, more difficult to  obtain than that of any articles of faith: they voted a subsidy of four  shillings in the pound on land, and two shillings and eightpence on  movables, together with two fifteenths.[**] [1] The house in no instance  departed from the most respectful deference and complaisance towards the  queen. Even the importune address which they made her on the conclusion  of the session, to fix her choice of a husband, could not, they  supposed, be very disagreeable to one of her sex and age. The address  was couched in the most respectful expressions, yet met with a refusal  from the queen.         * 1 Eliz. cap. 2.         ** See note A, at the end of the volume.    {1559.} She told the speaker, that, as the application from the house  was conceived in general terms, only recommending marriage, without  pretending to direct her choice of a husband, she could not take offence  at the address, or regard it otherwise than as a new instance of their  affectionate attachment to her: that any further interposition on their  part, would have ill become either them to make as subjects, or her  to bear as an independent princess: that even while she was a private  person, and exposed to much danger, she had always declined that  engagement, which she regarded as an encumbrance; much more, at present,  would she persevere in this sentiment, when the charge of a great  kingdom was committed to her, and her life ought to be entirely  devoted to promoting the interests of religion and the happiness of her  subjects: that as England was her husband, wedded to her by this pledge,  (and here she showed her finger with the same gold ring upon it  with which she had solemnly betrothed herself to the kingdom at her  inauguration,) so all Englishmen were her children, and while she was  employed in rearing or governing such a family, she could not deem  herself barren, or her life useless and unprofitable: that if she  ever entertained thoughts of changing her condition, the care of her  subjects' welfare would still be uppermost in her thoughts; but should  she live and die a virgin, she doubted not but divine Providence,  seconded by their counsels and her own measures, would be able to  prevent all dispute with regard to the succession, and secure them a  sovereign who, perhaps better than her own issue, would imitate her  example in loving and cherishing her people; and that for her part, she  desired that no higher character, or fairer remembrance of her should be  transmitted to posterity, than to have this inscription engraved on  her tombstone, when she should pay the last debt to nature: \"Here lies  Elizabeth, who lived and died a maiden queen.\"[*]    After the prorogation of the parliament,[**] the laws enacted with  regard to religion were put in execution, and met with little opposition  from any quarter. The liturgy was again introduced in the vulgar tongue,  and the oath of supremacy was tendered to the clergy. The number of  bishops had been reduced to fourteen by a sickly season which preceded:  and all these, except the bishop of Landaff, having refused compliance,  were degraded from their sees: but of the inferior clergy throughout all  England, where there are near ten thousand parishes, only eighty  rectors and vicars, fifty prebendaries fifteen heads of colleges,  twelve archdeacons, and as many deans, sacrificed their livings to their  religious principles.[***]         * Camden, p. 375. Sir Simon d'Ewes.         ** It is thought remarkable by Camden, that though this       session was the first of the reign, no person was attainted;       but on the contrary, some restored in blood by the       parliament; a good symptom of the lenity, at least of the       prudence, of the queen's government; and that it should       appear remarkable, is a proof of the rigor of preceding       reigns.         *** Camden, p. 376. Heylin, p. 115. Strype, vol. i. p. 73,       with some small variations.    Those in high ecclesiastic stations, being exposed to the eyes of  the public, seem chiefly to have placed a point of honor in their  perseverance; but on the whole, the Protestants, in the former  change introduced by Mary, appear to have been much more rigid and  conscientious. Though the Catholic religion, adapting itself to the  senses, and enjoining observances which enter into the common train of  life, does at present lay faster hold on the mind than the reformed,  which, being chiefly spiritual, resembles more a system of metaphysics,  yet was the proportion of zeal, as well as of knowledge, during the  first ages after the reformation, much greater on the side of the  Protestants. The Catholics continued, ignorantly and supinely, in their  ancient belief, or rather their ancient practices: but the reformers,  obliged to dispute on every occasion, and inflamed to a degree of  enthusiasm by novelty and persecution had strongly attached themselves  to their tenets; and were ready to sacrifice their fortunes, and even  their lives, in support of their speculative and abstract principles.    The forms and ceremonies still preserved in the English liturgy, as  they bore some resemblance to the ancient service, tended further to  reconcile the Catholics to the established religion; and as the queen  permitted no other mode of worship, and at the same time struck out  every thing that could be offensive to them in the new liturgy,[*]  even those who were addicted to the Romish communion made no scruple  of attending the established church. Had Elizabeth gratified her own  inclinations, the exterior appearance, which is the chief circumstance  with the people, would have been still more similar between the new and  the ancient form of worship. Her love of state and magnificence, which  she affected in every thing, inspired her with an inclination towards  the pomp of the Catholic religion; and it was merely in compliance with  the prejudices of her party, that she gave up either images, or the  addresses to saints, or prayers for the dead.[**] Some foreign princes  interposed to procure the Romanists the privilege of separate assemblies  in particular cities, but the queen would not comply "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19215"],[0,"The History of England in Three Volumes, Vol. I., Part E. (#3)"],[1,"that, if the force of Spain were really so  exorbitant as the commons imagined, the French monarch was the only  prince that could oppose its progress, and preserve the balance of  Europe; that his power was at present fettered by the Hugonots, who,  being possessed of many privileges, and even of fortified towns, formed  an empire within his empire, and kept him in perpetual jealousy and  inquietude; that an insurrection had been at that time wantonly and  voluntarily formed by their leaders, who, being disgusted in some court  intrigue, took advantage of the never failing pretence of religion,  in order to cover their rebellion, that the Dutch, influenced by these  views, had ordered a squadron of twenty ships to join the French fleet  employed against the inhabitants of Rochelle;[*] that the Spanish  monarch, sensible of the same consequences, secretly supported the  Protestants in France; and that all princes had ever sacrificed to  reasons of state the interests of their religion in foreign countries.  All these obvious considerations had no influence. Great murmurs and  discontents still prevailed in parliament. The Hugonots, though they had  no ground of complaint against the French court, were thought to be as  much entitled to assistance from England, as if they had taken arms in  defence of their liberties and religion against the persecuting rage  of the Catholics. And it plainly appears from this incident, as well  as from many others, that, of all European nations, the British were  at that time, and till long after, the most under the influence of that  religious spirit which tends rather to inflame bigotry than increase  peace and mutual charity.    On this occasion, the commons renewed their eternal complaints against  the growth of Popery, which was ever the chief of their grievances, and  now their only one.[**] They demanded a strict execution of the penal  laws against the Catholics, and remonstrated against some late pardons  granted to priests.[***] They attacked Montague, one of the king's  chaplains, on account of a moderate book which he had lately published,  and which, to their great disgust, saved virtuous Catholics, as well as  other Christians, from eternal torments.[****]         * Journ. 18th April, 1626.         ** Franklyn, p. 3, etc.         *** Parl. Hist. vol. vi. p. 374. Journ. 1st Aug. 1625.         **** Parl. Hist. vol. vi. p. 353 Journ. 7th July 1625.    Charles gave them a gracious and a compliant answer to all their  remonstrances. He was, however, in his heart, extremely averse to these  furious measures. Though a determined Protestant, by principle as well  as inclination, he had entertained no violent horror against Popery: and  a little humanity, he thought, was due by the nation to the religion  of their ancestors. That degree of liberty which is now indulged to  Catholics, though a party much more obnoxious than during the reign of  the Stuarts, it suited neither with Charles's sentiments nor the humor  of the age to allow them. An abatement of the more rigorous laws was all  he intended; and his engagements with France, notwithstanding that their  regular execution had never been promised or expected, required of him  some indulgence. But so unfortunate was this prince, that no measure  embraced during his whole reign, was ever attended with more unhappy and  more fatal consequences.    The extreme rage against Popery was a sure characteristic of Puritanism.  The house of commons discovered other infallible symptoms of the  prevalence of that party. They petitioned the king for replacing  such able clergy as had been silenced for want of conformity to the  ceremonies.[*] They also enacted laws for the strict observance of  Sunday, which the Puritans affected to call the Sabbath, and which they  sanctified by the most melancholy indolence.[**] It is to be remarked,  that the different appellations of this festival were at that time known  symbols of the different parties.    The king, finding that the parliament was resolved to grant him no  supply, and would furnish him with nothing but empty protestations of  duty,[***] or disagreeable complaints of grievances, took advantage of  the plague,[****] which began to appear at Oxford, and on that pretence  immediately dissolved them. By finishing the session with a dissolution,  instead of a prorogation, he sufficiently expressed his displeasure at  their conduct.         * Rushworth, vol. i. p. 281.         ** 1 Car. I. cap. 1. Journ. 21st June, 1625.         *** Franklyn, p. 113. Rushworth, vol. i. p. 190.         **** The plague was really so violent, that it had been       moved in the house, at the beginning of the session, to       petition the king to adjourn them. (Journ. 21st June, 1625.)       So it was impossible to enter upon grievances, even if there       had been any. The only business of the parliament was to       give supply, which was so much wanted by the king, in order       to carry on the war in which they had engaged him.    To supply the want of parliamentary aids, Charles issued privy seals  for borrowing money from his subjects.[*] The advantage reaped by this  expedient was a small compensation for the disgust which it occasioned.  By means, however, of that supply, and by other expedients, he was,  though with difficulty, enabled to equip his fleet. It consisted of  eighty vessels, great and small; and carried an board an army of ten  thousand men. Sir Edward Cecil, lately created Viscount Wimbleton, was  intrusted with the command. He sailed immediately for Cadiz, and found  the bay full of Spanish ships of great value. He either neglected to  attack these ships or attempted it preposterously. The army was landed,  and a fort taken; but the undisciplined soldiers, finding store of wine,  could not be restrained from the utmost excesses. Further stay appearing  fruitless, they were reembarked; and the fleet put to sea with an  intention of intercepting the Spanish galleons. But the plague having  seized the seamen and soldiers, they were obliged to abandon all hopes  of this prize, and return to England. Loud complaints were made against  the court for intrusting so important a command to a man like Cecil,  whom, though he possessed great experience, the people, judging by the  event, esteemed of slender capacity,[**]    {1626.} Charles, having failed of so rich a prize, was obliged again to  have recourse to a parliament. Though the ill success of his enterprises  diminished his authority, and showed every day more plainly the  imprudence of the Spanish war; though the increase of his necessities  rendered him more dependent, and more exposed to the encroachments  of the commons, he was resolved to try once more that regular and  constitutional expedient for supply. Perhaps, too, a little political  art, which at that time he practised, was much trusted to. He had named  four popular leaders, sheriffs of counties; Sir Edward Coke, Sir Robert  Philips, Sir Thomas Wentworth, and Sir Francis Seymour; and, though the  question had been formerly much contested,[***] he thought that he had  by that means incapacitated them from being elected members. But his  intention, being so evident, rather put the commons more upon their  guard. Enow of patriots still remained to keep up the ill humor of the  house; and men needed but little instruction or rhetoric to recommend to  them practices which increased their own importance and consideration.  The weakness of the court, also, could not more evidently appear, than  by its being reduced to use so ineffectual an expedient, in order to  obtain an influence over the commons.         * Rushworth, vol. i. p. 192. Parl. Hist, vol. vi. p. 407.         ** Franklyn, p. 113. Rushworth, vol. i. p. 196.         *** It is always an express clause in the writ of summons,       that no sheriff shall be chosen; but the contrary practice       had often prevailed D'Ewes, p. 38. Yet still great doubts       were entertained on this head. See Journ. 9th April, 1614.    The views, therefore, of the last parliament were immediately adopted;  as if the same men had been every where elected, and no time had  intervened since their meeting. When the king laid before the house  his necessities, and asked for supply, they immediately voted him three  subsidies and three fifteenths; and though they afterwards added one  subsidy more, the sum was little proportioned to the greatness of the  occasion, and ill fitted to promote those views of success and glory,  for which the young prince, in his first enterprise, so ardently longed.  But this circumstance was not the most disagreeable one. The supply  was only voted by the commons. The passing of that vote into a law was  reserved till the end of the session.[*] A condition was thereby made,  in a very undisguised manner, with their sovereign. Under color of  redressing grievances, which during this short reign could not be very  numerous, they were to proceed in regulating and controlling every part  of government which displeased them; and if the king either cut them  short in this undertaking, or refused compliance with their demands, he  must not expect any supply from the commons. Great dissatisfaction  was expressed by Charles at a treatment which he deemed so harsh and  undutiful.[**] But his urgent necessities obliged him to submit; and he  waited with patience, observing to what side they would turn themselves.    The duke of Buckingham, formerly obnoxious to the public, became every  day more unpopular, by the symptoms which appeared both of his want  of temper and prudence, and of the uncontrolled ascendant which he had  acquired over his master.[***]         * Journ. 27th March, 1626.         ** Parliamentary History, vol. vi. p. 449.
