MISCELLANEOUS PHRASES    There are many advantages in keeping before you a definite purpose in your  study of this book. A well-defined plan will act as an incentive to  regular and systematic effort, and incidentally develop your power of  concentration.    It is desirable that you set apart a certain convenient time each day for  this study. Regularity tends to produce maximum results. As you progress  with this work your interest will be quickened and you will realize the  desirability of giving more and more time to this important subject.    When you have chosen a section of the book which particularly appeals to  you, begin your actual study by reading the phrases aloud. Read them  slowly and understandingly. This tends to impress them more deeply upon  your mind, and is in itself one of the best and most practical ways of  acquiring a large and varied vocabulary. Moreover, the practise of  fitting words to the mouth rapidly develops fluency and facility of  speech.    Few persons realize the great value of reading aloud. Many of the foremost  English stylists devoted a certain period regularly to this practise.  Cardinal Newman read aloud each day a chapter from Cicero as a means of  developing his ear for sentence-rhythm. Rufus Choate, in order to  increase his command of language, and to avoid sinking into mere empty  fluency, read aloud daily, during a large part of his life, a page or more  from some great English author. As a writer has said, \"The practise of  storing the mind with choice passages from the best prose writers and  poets, and thus flavoring it with the essence of good literatures, is one  which is commended both by the best teachers and by the example of some of  the most celebrated orators, who have adopted it with signal success.\"    This study should be pursued with pencil in hand, so that you may readily  underscore phrases which make a special appeal to you. The free use of a  pencil in marking significant parts of a book is good evidence of  thoroughness. This, too, will facilitate your work of subsequent review.    The habit of regularly copying, in your own handwriting, one or more pages  of phrases will be of immense practical value. This exercise is a great  aid in developing a facile English style. The daily use of the pen has  been recommended in all times as a valuable means of developing oral and  literary expression.    A helpful exercise is to pronounce a phrase aloud and then fit it into a  complete sentence of your own making. This practice gives added facility  and resourcefulness in the use of words.    As an enthusiastic student of good English, you should carefully note  striking and significant phrases or literary expressions which you find in  your general reading. These should be set down in a note-book reserved for  this exclusive purpose. In this way you can prepare many lists of your  own, and thus greatly augment the value of this study.    The taste for beauty, truth, and harmony in language can be developed by  careful study of well-selected phrases and literary expressions as  furnished in this book. A good literary style is formed principally by  daily study of great English writers, by careful examination of words in  their context, and by a discriminating use of language at all times.

Now, because of this widespread and continually increasing interest in  the subject of other worlds, and on account of the many curious  revelations that we owe to modern telescopes and other improved means of  investigation, it is certainly to be desired that the most important and  interesting discoveries that have lately been made concerning the  various globes which together with the earth constitute the sun's  family, should be assembled in a convenient and popular form--and that  is the object of this book. Fact is admittedly often stranger and more  wonderful than fiction, and there are no facts that appeal more  powerfully to the imagination than do those of astronomy. Technical  books on astronomy usually either ignore the subject of the habitability  of the planets, or dismiss it with scarcely any recognition of the  overpowering human interest that it possesses. Hence, a book written  specially from the point of view of that subject would appear calculated  to meet a popular want; and this the more, because, since Mr. Proctor  wrote his Other Worlds than Ours and M. Flammarion his Pluralite des  Mondes Habites, many most important and significant discoveries have  been made that, in several notable instances, have completely altered  the aspect in which the planets present themselves for our judgment as  to their conditions of habitability.    No doubt the natural tendency of the mind is to regard all the planets  as habitable worlds, for there seems to be deeply implanted in human  nature a consciousness of the universality of life, giving rise to a  conviction that one world, even in the material sense, is not enough for  it, but that every planet must belong to its kingdom. We are apt to say  to ourselves: \"The earth is one of a number of planets, all similarly  circumstanced; the earth is inhabited, why should not the others also be  inhabited?\"    What has been learned of the unity in chemical constitution and  mechanical operation prevailing throughout the solar system, together  with the continually accumulating evidence of the common origin of its  various members, and the identity of the evolutionary processes that  have brought them into being, all tends to strengthen the _a priori_  hypothesis that life is a phenomenon general to the entire system, and  only absent where its essential and fundamental conditions, for special  and local, and perhaps temporary, reasons, do not exist.    If we look for life in the sun, for instance, while accepting the  prevalent conception of the sun as a center of intense thermal action,  we must abandon all our ideas of the physical organization of life  formed upon what we know of it from experimental evidence. We can not  imagine any form of life that has ever been presented to our senses as  existing in the sun.    But this is not generally true of the planets. Life, in our sense of it,  is a planetary, not a solar, phenomenon, and while we may find reasons  for believing that on some of the planets the conditions are such that  creatures organized like ourselves could not survive, yet we can not  positively say that every form of living organism must necessarily be  excluded from a world whose environment would be unsuited for us and our  contemporaries in terrestrial life.    Although our sole knowledge of animated nature is confined to what we  learn by experience on the earth, yet it is a most entertaining, and by  no means unedifying, occupation, to seek to apply to the exceedingly  diversified conditions prevailing in the other planets, as astronomical  observations reveal them to us, the principles, types, and limitations  that govern the living creatures of our world, and to judge, as best we  can, how far those types and limits may be modified or extended so that  those other planets may reasonably be included among the probable abodes  of life.    In order to form such judgments each planet must be examined by itself,  but first it is desirable to glance at the planetary system as a whole.  To do this we may throw off, in imagination, the dominance of the sun,  and suppose ourselves to be in the midst of open space, far removed both  from the sun and the other stars. In this situation it is only by  chance, or through foreknowledge, that we can distinguish our sun at  all, for it is lost among the stars; and when we discover it we find  that it is only one of the smaller and less conspicuous members of the  sparkling host.    We rapidly approach, and when we have arrived within a distance  comparable with that of its planets, we see that the sun has increased  in apparent magnitude, until now it enormously outshines all the other  stars, and its rays begin to produce the effect of daylight upon the  orbs that they reach. But we are in no danger of mistaking its apparent  superiority to its fellow stars for a real one, because we clearly  perceive that our nearness alone makes it seem so great and  overpowering.    And now we observe that this star that we have drawn near to has  attending it a number of minute satellites, faintly shining specks, that  circle about it as if charmed, like night-wandering insects, by its  splendor. It is manifest to us at the first glance that without the sun  these obedient little planets would not exist; it is his attraction that  binds them together in a system, and his rays that make them visible to  one another in the abyss of space. Although they vary in relative size,  yet we observe a striking similarity among them. They are all globular  bodies, they all turn upon their axes, they all travel about the sun in  the same direction, and their paths all lie very nearly in one plane.  Some of them have one or more moons, or satellites, circling about them  in imitation of their own revolution about the sun. Their family  relationship to one another and to the sun is so evident that it colors  our judgment about them as individuals; and when we happen to find, upon  closer approach, that one of them, the earth, is covered with vegetation  and water and filled with thousands of species of animated creatures, we  are disposed to believe, without further examination, that they are all  alike in this respect, just as they are all alike in receiving light and  heat from the sun.    This preliminary judgment, arising from the evident unity of the  planetary system, can only be varied by an examination of its members in  detail.    One striking fact that commands our attention as soon as we have entered  the narrow precincts of the solar system is the isolation of the sun and  its attendants in space. The solar system occupies a disk-shaped, or  flat circular, expanse, about 5,580,000,000 miles across and relatively  very thin, the sun being in the center. From the sun to the nearest  star, or other sun, the distance is approximately five thousand times  the entire diameter of the solar system. But the vast majority of the  stars are probably a hundred times yet more remote. In other words, if  the Solar system be represented by a circular flower-bed ten feet  across, the nearest star must be placed at a distance of nine and a half  miles, and the great multitude of the stars at a distance of nine  hundred miles!    Or, to put it in another way, let us suppose the sun and his planets to  be represented by a fleet of ships at sea, all included within a space  about half a mile across; then, in order that there might be no shore  relatively nearer than the nearest fixed star is to the sun, we should  have to place our fleet in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, while the  distance of the main shore of the starry universe would be so immense  that the whole surface of the earth would be far too small to hold the  expanse of ocean needed to represent it!    From these general considerations we next proceed to recall some of the  details of the system of worlds amid which we dwell. Besides the earth,  the sun has seven other principal planets in attendance. These eight  planets fall into two classes--the terrestrial planets and the major, or  jovian, planets. The former class comprises Mercury, Venus, the earth,  and Mars, and the latter Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. I have  named them all in the order of their distance from the sun, beginning  with the nearest.    The terrestrial planets, taking their class name from _terra_, the  earth, are relatively close to the sun and comparatively small. The  major planets--or the jovian planets, if we give them a common title  based upon the name of their chief, Jupiter or Jove--are relatively  distant from the sun and are characterized both by great comparative  size and slight mean density. The terrestrial planets are all included  within a circle, having the sun for a center, about 140,000,000 miles  in radius. The space, or gap, between the outermost of them, Mars, and  the innermost of the jovian planets, Jupiter, is nearly two and a half  times as broad as the entire radius of the circle within which they are  included. And not only is the jovian group of planets widely separated  from the terrestrial group, but the distances between the orbits of its  four members are likewise very great and progressively increasing.  Between Jupiter and Saturn is a gap 400,000,000 miles across, and this  becomes 900,000,000 miles between Saturn and Uranus, and more than  1,000,000,000 miles between Uranus and Neptune. All of these distances  are given in round numbers.    Finally, we come to some very extraordinary worlds--if we can call them  worlds at all--the asteroids. They form a third group, characterized by"]]]
