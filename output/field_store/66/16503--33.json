I thought of the words of the two slave women when  I saw Mrs. I----, and heard the harsh sound of her voice.    The person I took the most notice of that night was a French Black called  Hetty, whom my master took in privateering from another vessel, and made  his slave. She was the most active woman I ever saw, and she was tasked to  her utmost. A few minutes after my arrival she came in from milking the  cows, and put the sweet-potatoes on for supper. She then fetched home the  sheep, and penned them in the fold; drove home the cattle, and staked them  about the pond side;[4] fed and rubbed down my master's horse, and gave  the hog and the fed cow[5] their suppers; prepared the beds, and undressed  the children, and laid them to sleep. I liked to look at her and watch all  her doings, for hers was the only friendly face I had as yet seen, and I  felt glad that she was there. She gave me my supper of potatoes and milk,  and a blanket to sleep upon, which she spread for me in the passage before  the door of Mrs. I----'s chamber.    [Footnote 4: The cattle on a small plantation in Bermuda are, it seems,  often thus staked or tethered, both night and day, in situations where  grass abounds.]    [Footnote 5: A cow fed for slaughter.]    I got a sad fright, that night. I was just going to sleep, when I heard a  noise in my mistress's room; and she presently called out to inquire if  some work was finished that she had ordered Hetty to do. \"No, Ma'am, not  yet,\" was Hetty's answer from below. On hearing this, my master started up  from his bed, and just as he was, in his shirt, ran down stairs with a  long cow-skin[6] in his hand. I heard immediately after, the cracking of  the thong, and the house rang to the shrieks of poor Hetty, who kept  crying out, \"Oh, Massa! Massa! me dead. Massa! have mercy upon me--don't  kill me outright.\"--This was a sad beginning for me. I sat up upon my  blanket, trembling with terror, like a frightened hound, and thinking that  my turn would come next. At length the house became still, and I forgot  for a little while all my sorrows by falling fast asleep.    [Footnote 6: A thong of hard twisted hide, known by this name in the West  Indies.]    The next morning my mistress set about instructing me in my tasks. She  taught me to do all sorts of household work; to wash and bake, pick cotton  and wool, and wash floors, and cook. And she taught me (how can I ever  forget it!) more things than these; she caused me to know the exact  difference between the smart of the rope, the cart-whip, and the cow-skin,  when applied to my naked body by her own cruel hand. And there was  scarcely any punishment more dreadful than the blows I received on my face  and head from her hard heavy fist. She was a fearful woman, and a savage  mistress to her slaves.    There were two little slave boys in the house, on whom she vented her bad  temper in a special manner. One of these children was a mulatto, called  Cyrus, who had been bought while an infant in his mother's arms; the  other, Jack, was an African from the coast of Guinea, whom a sailor had  given or sold to my master. Seldom a day passed without these boys  receiving the most severe treatment, and often for no fault at all. Both  my master and mistress seemed to think that they had a right to ill-use  them at their pleasure; and very often accompanied their commands with  blows, whether the children were behaving well or ill. I have seen their  flesh ragged and raw with licks.--Lick--lick--they were never secure one  moment from a blow, and their lives were passed in continual fear. My  mistress was not contented with using the whip, but often pinched their  cheeks and arms in the most cruel manner. My pity for these poor boys was  soon transferred to myself; for I was licked, and flogged, and pinched by  her pitiless fingers in the neck and arms, exactly as they were. To strip  me naked--to hang me up by the wrists and lay my flesh open with the  cow-skin, was an ordinary punishment for even a slight offence. My  mistress often robbed me too of the hours that belong to sleep. She used  to sit up very late, frequently even until morning; and I had then to  stand at a bench and wash during the greater part of the night, or pick  wool and cotton; and often I have dropped down overcome by sleep and  fatigue, till roused from a state of stupor by the whip, and forced to  start up to my tasks.    Poor Hetty, my fellow slave, was very kind to me, and I used to call her  my Aunt; but she led a most miserable life, and her death was hastened (at  least the slaves all believed and said so,) by the dreadful chastisement  she received from my master during her pregnancy. It happened as follows.  One of the cows had dragged the rope away from the stake to which Hetty  had fastened it, and got loose. My master flew into a terrible passion,  and ordered the poor creature to be stripped quite naked, notwithstanding  her pregnancy, and to be tied up to a tree in the yard. He then flogged  her as hard as he could lick, both with the whip and cow-skin, till she  was all over streaming with blood. He rested, and then beat her again and  again. Her shrieks were terrible. The consequence was that poor Hetty was  brought to bed before her time, and was delivered after severe labour of a  dead child. She appeared to recover after her confinement, so far that she  was repeatedly flogged by both master and mistress afterwards; but her  former strength never returned to her. Ere long her body and limbs swelled  to a great size; and she lay on a mat in the kitchen, till the water burst  out of her body and she died. All the slaves said that death was a good  thing for poor Hetty; but I cried very much for her death. The manner of  it filled me with horror. I could not bear to think about it; yet it was  always present to my mind for many a day.    After Hetty died all her labours fell upon me, in addition to my own. I  had now to milk eleven cows every morning before sunrise, sitting among  the damp weeds; to take care of the cattle as well as the children; and to  do the work of the house. There was no end to my toils--no end to my  blows. I lay down at night and rose up in the morning in fear and sorrow;  and often wished that like poor Hetty I could escape from this cruel  bondage and be at rest in the grave. But the hand of that God whom then I  knew not, was stretched over me; and I was mercifully preserved for better  things. It was then, however, my heavy lot to weep, weep, weep, and that  for years; to pass from one misery to another, and from one cruel master  to a worse. But I must go on with the thread of my story.    One day a heavy squall of wind and rain came on suddenly, and my mistress  sent me round the corner of the house to empty a large earthen jar. The  jar was already cracked with an old deep crack that divided it in the  middle, and in turning it upside down to empty it, it parted in my hand. I  could not help the accident, but I was dreadfully frightened, looking  forward to a severe punishment. I ran crying to my mistress, \"O mistress,  the jar has come in two.\" \"You have broken it, have you?\" she replied;  \"come directly here to me.\" I came trembling; she stripped and flogged me  long and severely with the cow-skin; as long as she had strength to use  the lash, for she did not give over till she was quite tired.--When my  master came home at night, she told him of my fault; and oh, frightful!  how he fell a swearing. After abusing me with every ill name he could  think of, (too, too bad to speak in England,) and giving me several heavy  blows with his hand, he said, \"I shall come home to-morrow morning at  twelve, on purpose to give you a round hundred.\" He kept his word--Oh sad  for me! I cannot easily forget it. He tied me up upon a ladder, and gave  me a hundred lashes with his own hand, and master Benjy stood by to count  them for him. When he had licked me for some time he sat down to take  breath; then after resting, he beat me again and again, until he was quite  wearied, and so hot (for the weather was very sultry), that he sank back  in his chair, almost like to faint. While my mistress went to bring him  drink, there was a dreadful earthquake. Part of the roof fell down, and  every thing in the house went--clatter, clatter, clatter. Oh I thought the  end of all things near at hand; and I was so sore with the flogging, that  I scarcely cared whether I lived or died. The earth was groaning and  shaking; every thing tumbling about; and my mistress and the slaves were  shrieking and crying out, \"The earthquake! the earthquake!\" It was an  awful day for us all.    During the confusion I crawled away on my hands and knees, and laid myself  down under the steps of the piazza, in front of the house. I was in a  dreadful state--my body all blood and bruises, and I could not help  moaning piteously. The other slaves, when they saw me, shook their heads  and said, \"Poor child! poor child!\"--I lay there till the morning,  careless of what might happen, for life was very weak in me, and I wished  more than ever to die. But when we are very young, death always seems a  great way off, and it would not come that night to me. The next morning I  was forced by my master to rise and go about my usual work, though my body  and limbs were so stiff and sore, that I could not move without the  greatest pain.--Nevertheless, even after all this severe punishment, I  never heard the last of that jar; my mistress was always throwing it in my  face.    Some little time after this, one of the cows got loose from the stake, and  eat one of the sweet-potatoe slips. I was milking when my master found it  out. He came to me, and without any more ado, stooped down, and taking off  his heavy boot, he struck me such a severe blow in the small of my back,  that I shrieked with agony,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17855"],[0,"Hemp Hurds as Paper-Making Material (#3)"],[1," pernicious  practice of overcropping, which has contributed so much to the present  high and increasing cost of pulp wood. The permanency of the supply of  hemp hurds thus seems assured.    The favorable location geographically of the hemp regions in relation to  the pulp and paper industry is a factor of considerable importance. The  Kentucky region is not at present in a position to supply hurds, as  machine methods have not been adopted there to any appreciable degree.  The Ohio and Indiana region, which at present has the greatest annual  tonnage, with the prospect of an increase, is situated south of the  Wisconsin and Michigan wood-pulp producing region and at a distance from  the eastern wood-pulp producing regions; therefore, it is in a favorable  position to compete in the large Ohio and Indiana markets. Since, as  will be shown, the hurd pulp acts far more like soda poplar stock than  sulphite stock, competition would be strongest from the eastern mills;  in fact, the hurd stock might very possibly meet with favor as a  book-stock furnish in the Michigan and Wisconsin paper mills, which are  within the sulphite fiber-producing region. Because of its very close  proximity to paper mills, this latter possibility applies with far  greater force to the Wisconsin hemp region, where a considerable  extension of the hemp industry is anticipated.      [Illustration: FIG. 3.--A representative sample of hemp hurds, natural  size, showing hemp fiber and pieces of wood tissue.]      =CHARACTER OF THE MATERIAL.=    As received from Pierceton, Ind., the hurds consisted of a mixture of  tangled hemp bast fibers and pieces of broken wood of the hemp stalk.  (Fig. 3.) No reliable data were secured as to the proportion of bast  fiber in the total shipment of 4 tons, although two hand separations of  small representative samples gave results averaging 8 per cent. The  chemical character of the material was such and the quantity was so  small that any appreciable variation of the proportion should not affect  materially the treating processes finally adopted, yet its presence in  varying proportions undoubtedly would modify to some extent the quality  of the resulting paper product. Since the length of the ultimate bast  fiber averages about 22 mm. and the length of the ultimate hemp wood  fiber averages 0.7 mm., it is natural to assume that the bast fiber  would tend to increase the strength of paper produced from the hurds.  (Fig. 4.)      [Illustration: FIG. 4.--Fiber derived from the woody portion of the  hurds. x75. From a microphotograph.]    The broken pieces of wood contained in the hurds varied in length from  mere particles which were somewhat finer than sawdust to pieces about  3-1/2 inches long, exceptional pieces being found which measured 6  inches in length. The majority of the long pieces were between 2 and 3  inches in length. In thickness the pieces ranged from one-eighth of an  inch, in case they were derived from the base of the hemp stalks, to  about one sixty-fourth of an inch in those pieces which were derived  from the top and branches of the stalks. In cross section the pieces  often were found to be a quarter or half of the rounded rectangular  woody shell of the stalk, although there appeared to be no regularity in  this respect.    From the pulp-maker's standpoint the great irregularity in thickness,  length, and mass of the woody pieces militates decidedly against economy  in pulp production. The smaller pieces reduce by chemical treatment  sooner than the larger fragments and are thereby overtreated, which  results in a lower yield of cellulose fiber and a product composed of  undertreated and overtreated fibers, the production and use of which are  not satisfactory or economical. It probably would be found more  satisfactory, therefore, to screen or sort the hurds and treat the  various sizes separately and differently.    Associated with the hurds was a small quantity of chaff and dirt,  composed chiefly of sand, soil, particles of hemp leaves and flowers,  and other extraneous matter. The sand and soil were present because of  the practice of placing the stalks in shocks in the field, the butts of  the stalks being in contact with the soil. It is a simple matter,  however, to remove the chaff and dirt by sieving, and this practice was  followed in most of the paper tests conducted with this material.      =CHARACTER OF THE TESTS.=    Because of the similarity of hemp hurds to other materials which have  been tested by the Office of Paper-Plant Investigations, semicommercial  tests were conducted in cooperation with a paper manufacturer without  preliminary laboratory tests. Laboratory pulp and paper tests are  regarded only as a preliminary to semicommercial tests and therefore are  not employed unless the material in question presents new features which  should receive investigation before larger sized tests are undertaken.    The advantages of cooperative mill tests are many, among which may be  mentioned the counsel and advice of the mill management and employees,  the services of specialized and skilled labor, facilities for comparing  the processes and the results of tests with commercial processes and  results, and the use of commercial or semicommercial types and sizes of  machinery. Tests conducted in this manner and on this scale are of a  different quality than is possible in those conducted in a laboratory,  and the results are susceptible of commercial interpretation with a fair  degree of reliability. It is found, in general, that the cost of  securing such equipment and service for a complete and comprehensive  test does not exceed $500, while the installation of an equally  satisfactory equipment alone would cost at least $50,000 and in many  cases very much more. Tests conducted in this manner constitute a direct  demonstration to the manufacturer, and the results obtained are found to  carry more weight when presented to other manufacturers for  consideration.    It is well known that the method of conducting tests necessarily varies  with the size of the test. In the matter of yield determination, for  example, laboratory tests may be on such a small scale that the weighing  and sampling of the resulting cellulose fibers may be conducted by means  of chemical laboratory apparatus and analytical balance, while in tests  involving a matter of 5 to 10 pounds of material larger and different  types of equipment are necessary. When the tests are so increased in  size as to employ 300 or 400 pounds, still other types of equipment are  necessary for the treatment of the material and for a determination of  the yield of fiber. In tests involving tons of material the equipment  involves the use of machines. Accuracy in degree of control and in  results will vary materially with the size of the test. As the size of  the test increases, certain factors will vary in a beneficial manner,  while others will vary in a detrimental manner, so it is a question for  each investigator to decide, after taking all factors into  consideration, as to the size of test which will give the most  satisfactory results. In work of this nature it is found, on the whole,  that better results are obtained in large tests, although the control of  the factors and the determination of the yield of fiber are more  difficult than in smaller tests.    In the tests described in this bulletin, the Department of Agriculture  employed a rotary digester of its own design,[2] comprising a shell 5  feet 5 inches in length by 4 feet in diameter, capable of holding about  300 pounds of air-dry hurds. It is believed that a test of this size is  large enough to give satisfactory results and that the results are  susceptible of commercial interpretation, while at the same time they  are sufficiently small for complete control and to afford fiber-yield  figures which are both accurate and reliable. Two such rotary charges  gave enough fiber for one complete paper-making test.    [Footnote 2: For a description of this rotary digester, see Brand, C.  J., and Merrill, J. L., Zacaton as a paper-making material, U. S. Dept.  Agr. Bul. 309, p. 28, 1915.]      =OPERATIONS INVOLVED IN A TEST.=    A complete test on hurds comprises seven distinct operations, and the  method will be described, operation by operation, in the order in which  they were conducted.    _Sieving._--The hurds for the first test were not sieved to remove sand  and dirt, but the resulting paper was so dirty that sieving was  practiced in all subsequent tests. The hurds were raked along a  horizontal galvanized-iron screen, 15 feet long and 3 feet wide, with  11-1/2 meshes per linear inch, the screen being agitated by hand from  below. Various amounts of dirt and chaff could be removed, depending on  the degree of action, but it was found that if much more than 3 per cent  of the material was removed it consisted chiefly of fine pieces of wood  with practically no additional sand or dirt; in most of the tests,  therefore, the material was screened so as to remove approximately 3 per  cent. It became apparent that a finer screen would probably serve as  well and effect a saving of small but good hurds.    _Cooking._--Cooking is the technical term for the operation by which  fibrous raw materials are reduced to a residue of cellulose pulp by  means of chemical treatment. In these tests about 300 pounds of hurds  were charged into the rotary with the addition of a caustic-soda  solution, such as is regularly employed in pulp mills and which tested  an average of 109.5 grams of caustic soda per liter, or 0.916 pound per  gallon, and averaged 85 per cent causticity. Sufficient caustic solution  was added to furnish 25 or 30 per cent of actual caustic soda,  calculated on the bone-dry weight of hurds in the charge. After closing  the rotary head, it was started rotating at the rate of one-half  revolution per minute, and in about five minutes steam at 120"]]]
