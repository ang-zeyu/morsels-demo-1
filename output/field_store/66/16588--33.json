The Hands of the Cause of God must elect from their own number nine  persons that shall at all times be occupied in the important services in  the work of the guardian of the Cause of God. The election of these nine  must be carried either unanimously or by majority from the company of the  Hands of the Cause of God and these, whether unanimously or by a majority  vote, must give their assent to the choice of the one whom the guardian of  the Cause of God hath chosen as his successor. This assent must be given  in such wise as the assenting and dissenting voices may not be  distinguished. (secret ballot)    O friends! The Hands of the Cause of God must be nominated and appointed  by the guardian of the Cause of God. All must be under his shadow and obey  his command. Should any, within or without the company of the Hands of the  Cause of God disobey and seek division, the wrath of God and His vengeance  will be upon him, for he will have caused a breach in the true Faith of  God.    The obligations of the Hands of the Cause of God are to diffuse the Divine  Fragrances, to edify the souls of men, to promote learning, to improve the  character of all men and to be, at all times and under all conditions,  sanctified and detached from earthly things. They must manifest the fear  of God by their conduct, their manners, their deeds and their words.    This body of the Hands of the Cause of God is under the direction of the  guardian of the Cause of God. He must continually urge them to strive and  endeavor to the utmost of their ability to diffuse the sweet savors of  God, and to guide all the peoples of the world, for it is the light of  Divine Guidance that causeth all the universe to be illumined. To  disregard, though it be for a moment, this absolute command which is  binding upon everyone, is in no wise permitted, that the existent world  may become even as the Abha Paradise, that the surface of the earth may  become heavenly, that contention and conflict amidst peoples, kindreds,  nations and governments may disappear, that all the dwellers on earth may  become one people and one race, that the world may become even as one  home. Should differences arise they shall be amicably and conclusively  settled by the Supreme Tribunal, that shall include members from all the  governments and peoples of the world.    O ye beloved of the Lord! In this sacred Dispensation, conflict and  contention are in no wise permitted. Every aggressor deprives himself of  God's grace. It is incumbent upon everyone to show the utmost love,  rectitude of conduct, straightforwardness and sincere kindliness unto all  the peoples and kindreds of the world, be they friends or strangers. So  intense must be the spirit of love and loving-kindness, that the stranger  may find himself a friend, the enemy a true brother, no difference  whatsoever existing between them. For universality is of God and all  limitations earthly. Thus man must strive that his reality may manifest  virtues and perfections, the light whereof may shine upon everyone. The  light of the sun shineth upon all the world and the merciful showers of  Divine Providence fall upon all peoples. The vivifying breeze reviveth  every living creature and all beings endued with life obtain their share  and portion at His heavenly board. In like manner, the affections and  loving-kindness of the servants of the One True God must be bountifully  and universally extended to all mankind. Regarding this, restrictions and  limitations are in no wise permitted.    Wherefore, O my loving friends! Consort with all the peoples, kindreds and  religions of the world with the utmost truthfulness, uprightness,  faithfulness, kindliness, good-will and friendliness; that all the world  of being may be filled with the holy ecstasy of the grace of Baha, that  ignorance, enmity, hate and rancor may vanish from the world and the  darkness of estrangement amidst the peoples and kindreds of the world may  give way to the Light of Unity. Should other peoples and nations be  unfaithful to you show your fidelity unto them, should they be unjust  toward you show justice towards them, should they keep aloof from you  attract them to yourself, should they show their enmity be friendly  towards them, should they poison your lives sweeten their souls, should  they inflict a wound upon you be a salve to their sores. Such are the  attributes of the sincere! Such are the attributes of the truthful.    And now, concerning the House of Justice which God hath ordained as the  source of all good and freed from all error, it must be elected by  universal suffrage, that is, by the believers. Its members must be  manifestations of the fear of God and daysprings of knowledge and  understanding, must be steadfast in God's faith and the well-wishers of  all mankind. By this House is meant the Universal House of Justice, that  is, in all countries, a secondary House of Justice must be instituted, and  these secondary Houses of Justice must elect the members of the Universal  one. Unto this body all things must be referred. It enacteth all  ordinances and regulations that are not to be found in the explicit Holy  Text. By this body all the difficult problems are to be resolved and the  guardian of the Cause of God is its sacred head and the distinguished  member for life of that body. Should he not attend in person its  deliberations, he must appoint one to represent him. Should any of the  members commit a sin, injurious to the common weal, the guardian of the  Cause of God hath at his own discretion the right to expel him, whereupon  the people must elect another one in his stead.          \"O ye beloved of the Lord! It is incumbent upon you to be submissive...\"      O ye beloved of the Lord! It is incumbent upon you to be submissive to all  monarchs that are just and show your fidelity to every righteous king.  Serve ye the sovereigns of the world with utmost truthfulness and loyalty.  Show obedience unto them and be their well-wishers. Without their leave  and permission do not meddle with political affairs, for disloyalty to the  just sovereign is disloyalty to God himself.    This is my counsel and the commandment of God unto you. Well is it with  them that act accordingly.          \"By the Ancient Beauty! This wronged one hath in no wise...\"      By the Ancient Beauty! This wronged one hath in no wise borne nor doth he  bear a grudge against any one; towards none doth he entertain any  ill-feeling and uttereth no word save for the good of the world. My  supreme obligation, however, of necessity, prompteth me to guard and  preserve the Cause of God. Thus, with the greatest regret, I counsel you  saying:--\"Guard ye the Cause of God, protect His law and have the utmost  fear of discord. This is the foundation of the belief of the people of  Baha (may my life be offered up for them). \"His Holiness, the Exalted One,  (the Bab) is the Manifestation of the Unity and Oneness of God and the  Forerunner of the Ancient Beauty. His Holiness the Abha Beauty, (may my  life be a sacrifice for His steadfast friends) is the Supreme  Manifestation of God and the Dayspring of His Most Divine Essence. All  others are servants unto Him and do His bidding.\" Unto the Most Holy Book  every one must turn and all that is not expressly recorded therein must be  referred to the Universal House of Justice. That which this body, whether  unanimously or by a majority doth carry, that is verily the Truth and the  Purpose of God himself. Whoso doth deviate therefrom is verily of them  that love discord, hath shown forth malice and turned away from the Lord  of the Covenant. By this House is meant that Universal House of Justice  which is to be elected from all countries, that is, from those parts in  the East and West where the loved ones are to be found, after the manner  of the customary elections in Western countries such as those of England.          \"O ye beloved of the Lord! Strive with all your heart to shield...\"      O ye beloved of the Lord! Strive with all your heart to shield the Cause  of God from the onslaught of the insincere, for souls such as these cause  the straight to become crooked and all benevolent efforts to produce  contrary results.    O God, my God! I call Thee, Thy Prophets and Thy Messengers, Thy Saints  and Thy Holy Ones, to witness that I have declared conclusively Thy Proofs  unto Thy loved ones and set forth clearly all things unto them, that they  may watch over Thy Faith, guard Thy Straight Path and protect Thy  Resplendent Law. Thou art, verily, the All-knowing, the All-wise!          \"Whosoever and whatsoever meeting becometh a hindrance to...\"      Whosoever and whatsoever meeting becometh a hindrance to the diffusion of  the Light of Faith, let the loved ones give them counsel and say: \"Of all  the gifts of God the greatest is the gift of Teaching. It draweth unto us  the Grace of God and is our first obligation. Of such a gift how can we  deprive ourselves? Nay, our lives, our goods, our comforts, our rest, we  offer them all as a sacrifice for the Abha Beauty and teach the Cause of  God.\" Caution and prudence, however, must be observed even as recorded in  the Book. The veil must in no wise be suddenly rent asunder. The Glory of  Glories rest upon you.    O ye the faithful loved ones of 'Abdu'l-Baha! It is incumbent upon you to  take the greatest care of Shoghi Effendi, the twig that hath branched from  the fruit given forth by the two hallowed and Divine Lote-Trees, that no  dust of despondency and sorrow may stain his radiant nature, that day by  day he may wax greater in happiness, in joy and spirituality, and may grow  to become even as a fruitful tree.    For he is, after 'Abdu'l-Baha, the guardian of the Cause of God, the  Afnan, the Hands (pillars) of the Cause and the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19254"],[0,"Citadel of Faith (#3)"],[1,"recognized, whilst in the course of the Golden Age, destined to consummate  the Dispensation itself, the banner of the Most Great Peace, promised by  its Author, will have been unfurled, the World Baha'i Commonwealth will  have emerged in the plenitude of its power and splendor, and the birth and  efflorescence of a world civilization, the child of that Peace, will have  conferred its inestimable blessings upon all mankind.            FOURFOLD OBJECTIVE TO PRESENT REQUIREMENTS      Not ours, however, to unriddle the workings of a distant future, or to  dwell upon the promised glories of a God-impelled and unimaginably potent  Revelation. Ours, rather, the task to cast our eyes upon, and bend our  energies to meet, the challenging requirements of the present hour.  Labors, of an urgent and sacred character, claim insistently our undivided  attention during the opening years of this new epoch which we have  entered. The Second Seven Year Plan, intended to carry a stage further the  mission conceived by 'Abdu'l-Baha for the American Baha'i Community, is  now entering its second year, and must, as it operates in three  continents, be productive of results outshining any as yet achieved since  the Divine Plan itself was set in motion during the concluding years of  the first Baha'i century. Unlike the plans which Baha'i communities in  Europe and on the Asiatic continent have spontaneously inaugurated since  the commencement of the present century, the Plan with which the community  of the \"Apostles of Baha'u'llah\" stands identified is divine in origin, is  guided by the explicit and repeated instructions that have flowed from the  pen of the Center of the Covenant Himself, is energized by the  all-compelling will of its Author, claims as the theater for its operation  territories spread over five continents and the islands of the seven seas,  and must continue to function, ere its purpose is achieved, throughout  successive epochs in the course of the Formative Age of the Baha'i  Dispensation. As it propels itself forward, driven by forces which its  prosecutors can not hope to properly assess, as it spreads its  ramifications to the furthest corners of the Western Hemisphere, and  across the oceans to the continents of the Old World, and beyond them to  the far-flung islands of the seas, this Plan, the birthright of the North  American Baha'i Community, will be increasingly regarded as an agency  designed not only for the enlargement of the limits of the Faith and the  multiplication of its institutions over the face of the planet, but for  the acceleration of the construction and completion of the administrative  framework of Baha'u'llah's embryonic World Order, hastening thereby the  advent of that Golden Age which must witness the proclamation of the Most  Great Peace and the unfoldment of that world civilization which is the  offspring and primary purpose of that Peace.    The fourfold objective, which the prosecutors of the Plan, in the present  early stage of its development, are now pursuing, and which is designed to  stimulate the dual process initiated during the opening phase of the  Formative Age of the Faith, must be strenuously and unfalteringly pursued.  The second year of the Second Seven Year Plan must witness, on all fronts,  on the part of young and old alike, rich and poor, colored and white,  neophyte and veteran, a rededication to the tasks undertaken and an  intensification of effort for their furtherance wholly unparalleled in the  annals of American Baha'i history. In every state of the United States, in  every province of the Dominion of Canada, in every republic of Central and  South America, in each of the ten selected sovereign states of the  European continent, the ever-swelling legions of Baha'u'llah's steadily  advancing army, obeying the Mandate of 'Abdu'l-Baha, launched on the  second stage of their world-wide crusade, deriving fresh courage from the  exploits that have distinguished the opening phase of the present stage of  their enterprise, must strain every nerve to scale loftier heights of  heroism, and deploy, over a wider range, their divinely sustained forces,  as their present Plan unfolds and moves towards a climax.            GOALS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ALASKA      In the United States of America, the base from which the manifold  operations of this holy expedition are conducted, the enterprise  associated with the completion of the first Ma_sh_riqu'l-A_dh_kar of the  West, designed to consummate this historic undertaking in time for the  celebration of its Jubilee in the year 1953, must be strenuously pushed  forward. The prodigious efforts exerted for the erection of this noble  edifice--the holiest House of Worship ever to be reared by the followers of  Baha'u'llah--on which no less than one million four hundred thousand  dollars have thus far been expended, and which will necessitate the  expenditure of at least half a million more dollars, ere it is completed,  must not, for one moment, be relaxed. The necessary modifications of the  design chosen for its interior ornamentation should be adopted, the plans  and specifications prepared, the preliminary contracts for its execution  placed, and actual construction work started, if possible, ere the expiry  of the present year.    The utmost effort by the National Teaching Committee and its auxiliary  Regional Teaching Committees, aimed at raising the number of spiritual  assemblies in the North American continent to no less than one hundred and  seventy-five, ere the expiry of the current year, should be exerted. The  eighty cities newly opened to the Faith should, likewise, be reinforced.  The two hundred and eighteen groups already constituted should be  continually encouraged to evolve into assemblies, while the vast number of  localities, totalling over nine hundred, where isolated believers reside,  should, however tremendous the exertion required, be enabled to attain  group status, and be eventually converted into properly functioning  assemblies.    Collateral to this process of reinforcing the fabrics of the  Administrative Order and of widening its basis, a resolute attempt should  be made by the national elected representatives of the entire community,  aided by their Public Relations, Race Unity, Public Meetings, Visual  Education, College Speakers Bureau and Radio Committees, to reinforce the  measures already adopted for the proclamation, through the press and  radio, of the verities of the Faith to the masses, and for the  establishment of closer contact with the leaders of public thought, with  colleges and universities and with newspaper and magazine editors.  National advertising and publicity should be further developed, the  contact with seven hundred and fifty newspapers, magazines and trade  papers should be maintained and the public relations programs amplified.  Association, as distinct from affiliation, and untainted by any  participation in political matters, with the various organs, leaders and  representatives of the United Nations and kindred organizations should be  stimulated for the purpose of giving, on the one hand, greater publicity  to the aims and purposes of the Faith, and of paving the way, on the  other, for the eventual conversion of a selected number of capable and  receptive souls who will reinforce the ranks of its active and unreserved  supporters.    The process of the incorporation of properly functioning spiritual  assemblies must be simultaneously and vigorously carried out. The  forty-five assemblies now incorporated are the first fruits of an  enterprise of great significance, which must rapidly develop in the days  to come, as an essential preliminary to the establishment, and the  extension of the scope, of Baha'i local endowments, as soon as the  financial obligations incurred in connection with the completion of the  Temple have been discharged. The institutions of the three summer schools,  at Green Acre, Davison and Geyserville, and the International School at  Temerity Ranch, as well as the activities of the Baha'i Youth, must, under  the close supervision of their respective national committees, be  continually expanded and increasingly utilized as agencies for the  furtherance of the vital objectives of the Plan.    The beneficial and highly responsible activities undertaken by the  Publishing, the Reviewing, the Library, the Service for the Blind, the  Visual Education, the Pamphlet Literature and Study Aids Committees,  designed to disseminate and insure the integrity of Baha'i literature,  should, however indirectly connected with the purposes of the Plan, and  within the limits imposed upon them through its operation, be steadily  expanded, consolidated and be made to promote, in whatever way possible,  its paramount interests.    Nor should the \"spacious territory of Alaska,\" particularly mentioned by  'Abdu'l-Baha in His Tablets of the Divine Plan, and at present the  northern outpost of the Faith in the Western Hemisphere, be ignored, or  its vital requirements neglected. The maintenance and consolidation of the  first historic spiritual assembly in Anchorage, the northernmost  administrative center of the Faith of Baha'u'llah in the world; the  multiplication of Baha'i centers in that territory; the propagation of the  teachings among the Eskimos, emphasized by 'Abdu'l-Baha's pen in those  same Tablets; the translation and publication of selected passages from  Baha'i literature in their native language; the extension of the limits of  the Faith beyond Fairbanks and nearer to the Arctic Circle--these  constitute the urgent tasks facing the prosecutors of the present Plan in  the years immediately ahead.    \"Alaska is a vast country,\" are 'Abdu'l-Baha's own words, recorded in  those Tablets, \"...Perchance, God willing, the lights of the Most Great  Guidance will illuminate that country, and the breezes of the rose garden  of the love of God"]]]
