Upon the following day Charlie was introduced, by his uncle, to the  director who had given him his nomination, and was told by him that  the board would sit upon the following day, and that he must call at  the India House, at eleven o'clock. The ordeal was not a formidable  one. He was shown into a room where eight or ten elderly gentlemen  were sitting round a large table. Among these was his friend of the  day before. He was asked a question or two about his age, his father's  profession, and his place of education. Then the gentleman at the head  of the table nodded to him, and said he could go, and instructions  would be sent to him, and that he was to prepare to sail in the Lizzie  Anderson, which would leave the docks in ten days' time, and that he  would be, for the present, stationed at Madras.    Much delighted at having got through the ordeal so easily, Charlie  returned to his uncle's. He did not venture to penetrate into the  latter's counting house, but awaited his coming upstairs to dinner, to  tell him the news.    \"Humph!\" said his uncle; \"it is lucky they did not find out what a  fool you were, at once. I was rather afraid that even the two minutes  would do it. After dinner, I will send my clerk round with you, to get  the few things which are necessary for your voyage.    \"I suppose you will want to, what you call amuse yourself, to see the  beasts at Exeter Change, and the playhouses. Here are two sovereigns.  Don't get into loose company, and don't get drinking, sir, or out of  the house you go.\"    Charlie attempted to express his thanks, but his uncle stopped him  abruptly.    \"Hold your tongue, sir. I am doing what is right; a thing, sir, Joshua  Tufton always has done, and doesn't expect to be thanked for it. All I  ask you is, that if you rob the Company's till and are hung, don't  mention that you are related to me.\"    After dinner was over, Charlie went out under the charge of an old  clerk, and visited tailors' and outfitters' shops, and found that his  uncle's idea of the few necessaries for a voyage differed very widely  from his own. The clerk, in each case, inquired from the tradesmen  what was the outfit which gentlemen going to India generally took with  them, and Charlie was absolutely appalled at the magnitude of the  orders. Four dozen shirts, ten dozen pairs of stockings, two dozen  suits of white cotton cloth, and everything else in proportion.  Charlie in vain remonstrated, and even implored the clerk to abstain  from ordering what appeared to him such a fabulous amount of things;  and begged him, at any rate, to wait until he had spoken to his uncle.  The clerk, however, replied that he had received instructions that the  full usual outfit was to be obtained, and that Mr. Tufton never  permitted his orders to be questioned. Charlie was forced to submit,  but he was absolutely oppressed with the magnitude of his outfit, to  carry which six huge trunks were required.    \"It is awful,\" Charlie said to himself, \"positively awful. How much it  will all come to, goodness only knows; three or four hundred pounds,  at least.\"    In those days, before steam was thought of, and the journey to India  was often of six months' duration, men never came home more than once  in seven years, and often remained in India from the day of their  arrival until they finally retired, without once revisiting England.  The outfits taken out were, therefore, necessarily much larger than at  the present time, when a run home to England can be accomplished in  three weeks, and there are plenty of shops, in every town in India,  where all European articles of necessity or luxury can be purchased.    After separating from the clerk, Charlie felt altogether unable to  start out in search of amusement. He wandered about vaguely till  supper time, and then attempted to address his uncle on the subject.    \"My dear Uncle,\" he began, \"you've been so awfully kind to me, that I  really do not like to trespass upon you. I am positively frightened at  the outfit your clerk has ordered. It is enormous. I'm sure I can't  want so many things, possibly, and I would really rather take a much  smaller outfit; and then, as I want them, I can have more things out  from England, and pay for them myself.\"    \"You don't suppose,\" Mr. Tufton said sternly, \"that I'm going to have  my nephew go out to India with the outfit of a cabin boy. I ordered  that you were to have the proper outfit of a gentleman, and I  requested my clerk to order a considerable portion of the things to be  made of a size which will allow for your growing, for you look to me  as if you were likely enough to run up into a lanky giant, of six feet  high. I suppose he has done as I ordered him. Don't let me hear  another word on the subject.\"        Chapter 2: The Young Writer.      For the next four days, Charlie followed his uncle's instructions and  amused himself. He visited Exeter Change, took a boat and rowed down  the river to Greenwich, and a coach and visited the palace of Hampton  Court. He went to see the coaches make their start, in the morning,  for all places in England, and marvelled at the perfection of the  turnouts. He went to the playhouses twice, in the evening, and saw Mr.  Garrick in his performance as Richard the Third.    On the fifth day, a great surprise awaited him. His uncle, at  breakfast, had told him briefly that he did not wish him to go out  before dinner, as someone might want to see him; and Charlie,  supposing that a messenger might be coming down from the India House,  waited indoors; and an hour later he was astonished, when the door of  the room opened and his mother and sisters entered.    With a shout of gladness and surprise, Charlie rushed into their arms.    \"My dear mother, my dear girls, this is an unexpected pleasure,  indeed! Why, what has brought you here?\"    \"Didn't you know we were coming, Charlie? Didn't Uncle tell you?\" they  exclaimed.    \"Not a word,\" Charlie said. \"I never dreamt of such a thing. What, has  he called you up here to stay till I go?\"    \"Oh, my dear, he has been so kind,\" his mother said; \"and so funny! He  wrote me such a scolding letter, just as if I had been a very naughty  little girl. He said he wasn't going to allow me to bring disgrace  upon him, by living in wretched lodgings at Yarmouth, nor by his  grandnieces being sent out as governesses. So he ordered me at  once--ordered me Charlie, as if I had no will of my own--to give up  the lodgings, and to take our places in the coach, yesterday morning.  He said we were not to shame him by appearing here in rags, and he  sent me a hundred pounds, every penny of which, he said, was to be  laid out in clothes. As to the future, he said it would be his duty to  see that I brought no further disgrace upon the family.\"    \"Yes, and he's been just as kind to me, Mother. As I told you when I  wrote, he had ordered an enormous outfit, which will, I am sure, cost  hundreds of pounds. He makes me go to the playhouses, and all sorts of  amusements; and all the time he has been so kind he scolds, and  grumbles, and predicts that I shall be hanged.\"    \"I'm sure you won't,\" Kate, his youngest sister, said indignantly.  \"How can he say such a thing?\"    \"He doesn't mean it,\" Charlie laughed. \"It's only his way. He will go  on just the same way with you, I have no doubt; but you mustn't mind,  you know, and mustn't laugh, but must look quite grave and serious.    \"Ah! Here he is.    \"Oh, Uncle, this is kind of you!\"    \"Hold your tongue, sir,\" said his uncle, \"and try and learn not to  speak to your elders, unless you are addressed.    \"Niece Mary,\" he said, kissing her upon the forehead, \"I am glad to  see you again. You are not so much changed as I expected.    \"And these are my grandnieces, Elizabeth and Kate, though why Kate I  don't know. It is a fanciful name, and new to the family, and I am  surprised that you didn't call her Susanna, after your grandmother.\"    Kate made a little face at the thought of being called Susanna.  However, a warning glance from Charlie closed her lips, just as she  was about to express her decided preference for her own name. Mr.  Tufton kissed them both, muttering to himself:    \"I suppose I ought to kiss them. Girls always expect to be kissed at  every opportunity.    \"What are you laughing at, grandniece?\"    \"I don't think girls expect to be kissed, except by people they like,\"  Kate said; \"but we do like kissing you, Uncle,\" throwing her arms  round his neck, and kissing him heartily; \"because you have been so  kind to Charlie, and have brought us up to see him again.\"    \"You have disarranged my white tie, Niece,\" Mr. Tufton said,  extricating himself from Kate's embrace.    \"Niece Mary, I fear that you have not taught your daughters to  restrain their emotions, and there is nothing so dreadful as emotional  women.\"    \"Perhaps I have not taken so much pains with their education, in that  way, as in some others,\" Mrs. Marryat said, smiling. \"But of course,  Uncle, if you object to be kissed, the girls will abstain from doing  so.\"    \"No,\" Mr. Tufton said, thoughtfully. \"It is the duty of nieces to kiss  their uncles, in moderation--in moderation, mind--and it is the duty  of the uncles to receive those salutations, and I do not know that the  duty is altogether an unpleasant one. I am, myself, unaccustomed to be  kissed, but it is an operation to which I may accustom myself, in  time.\"    \"I never heard it called an operation, Uncle,\" Lizzie said demurely;  \"but I now understand the meaning of the phrase of a man's undergoing  a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18837"],[0,"Commentarii de Bello Gallico (#3)"],[1,"vimus, quibus regionibus quattuor reges praeerant,  Cingetorix, Carvilius, Taximagulus, Segovax, nuntios mittit atque eis  imperat uti coactis omnibus copiis castra navalia de improviso  adoriantur atque oppugent. Ei cum ad castra venissent, nostri eruptione  facta multis eorum interfectis, capto etiam nobili duce Lugotorige suos  incolumes reduxerunt. Cassivellaunus hoc proelio nuntiato tot  detrimentis acceptis, vastatis finibus, maxime etiam permotus defectione  civitatum legatos per Atrebatem Commium de deditione ad Caesarem mittit.  Caesar, cum constituisset hiemare in continenti propter repentinos  Galliae motus, neque multum aestatis superesset, atque id facile extrahi  posse intellegeret, obsides imperat et quid in annos singulos vectigalis  populo Romano Britannia penderet constituit; interdicit atque imperat  Cassivellauno, ne Mandubracio neu Trinobantibus noceat.      23    Obsidibus acceptis exercitum reducit ad mare, naves invenit refectas.  His deductis, quod et captivorum magnum numerum habebat, et nonnullae  tempestate deperierant naves, duobus commeatibus exercitum reportare  instituit. Ac sic accidit, uti ex tanto navium numero tot navigationibus  neque hoc neque superiore anno ulla omnino navis, quae milites portaret,  desideraretur; at ex eis, quae inanes ex continenti ad eum remitterentur  et prioris commeatus expositis militibus et quas postea Labienus  faciendas curaverat numero LX, perpaucae locum caperent, reliquae fere  omnes reicerentur. Quas cum aliquamdiu Caesar frustra exspectasset, ne  anni tempore a navigatione excluderetur, quod aequinoctium suberat,  necessario angustius milites collocavit ac summa tranquillitate  consecuta, secunda inita cum solvisset vigilia, prima luce terram  attigit omnesque incolumes naves perduxit.      24    Subductis navibus concilioque Gallorum Samarobrivae peracto, quod eo  anno frumentum in Gallia propter siccitates angustius provenerat,  coactus est aliter ac superioribus annis exercitum in hibernis collocare  legionesque in plures civitates distribuere. Ex quibus unam in Morinos  ducendam Gaio Fabio legato dedit, alteram in Nervios Quinto Ciceroni,  tertiam in Esubios Lucio Roscio; quartam in Remis cum Tito Labieno in  confinio Treverorum hiemare iussit. Tres in Belgis collocavit: eis  Marcum Crassum quaestorem et Lucium Munatium Plancum et Gaium Trebonium  legatos praefecit. Vnam legionem, quam proxime trans Padum  conscripserat, et cohortes V in Eburones, quorum pars maxima est inter  Mosam ac Rhenum, qui sub imperio Ambiorigis et Catuvolci erant, misit.  Eis militibus Quintum Titurium Sabinum et Lucium Aurunculeium Cottam  legatos praeesse iussit. Ad hunc modum distributis legionibus facillime  inopiae frumentariae sese mederi posse existimavit. Atque harum tamen  omnium legionum hiberna praeter eam, quam Lucio Roscio im pacatissimam  et quietissimam partem ducendam dederat, milibus passuum centum  continebantur. Ipse interea, quoad legiones collocatas munitaque hiberna  cognovisset, in Gallia morari constituit.      25    Erat in Carnutibus summo loco natus Tasgetius, cuius maiores in sua  civitate regnum obtinuerant. Huic Caesar pro eius virtute atque in se  benevolentia, quod in omnibus bellis singulari eius onera fuerat usus,  maiorum locum restituerat. Tertium iam hunc annum regnantem inimici,  multis palam ex civitate eius auctoribus, eum interfecerunt. Defertur ea  res ad Caesarem. Ille veritus, quod ad plures pertinebat, ne civitas  eorum impulsu deficeret, Lucium Plancum cum legione ex Belgio celeriter  in Carnutes proficisci iubet ibique hiemare quorumque opera cognoverat  Tasgetium interfectum, hos comprehensos ad se mittere. Interim ab  omnibus legatis quaestoreque, quibus legiones tradiderat, certior factus  est in hiberna perventum locumque hibernis esse munitum.      26    Diebus circiter XV, quibus in hiberna ventum est, initium repentini  tumultus ac defectionis ortum est ab Ambiorige et Catuvolco; qui, cum ad  fines regni sui Sabino Cottaeque praesto fuissent frumentumque in  hiberna comportavissent, Indutiomari Treveri nuntiis impulsi suos  concitaverunt subitoque oppressis lignatoribus magna manu ad castra  oppugnatum venerunt. Cum celeriter nostri arma cepissent vallumque  adscendissent atque una ex parte Hispanis equitibus emissis equestri  proelio superiores fuissent, desperata re hostes suos ab oppugnatione  reduxerunt. Tum suo more conclamaverunt, uti aliqui ex nostris ad  colloquium prodiret: habere sese, quae de re communi dicere vellent,  quibus rebus controversias minui posse sperarent.      27    Mittitur ad eos colloquendi causa Gaius Arpineius, eques Romanus,  familiaris Quinti Tituri, et Quintus Iunius ex Hispania quidam, qui iam  ante missu Caesaris ad Ambiorigem ventitare consuerat; apud quos  Ambiorix ad hunc modum locutus est: Sese pro Caesaris in se beneficiis  plurimum ei confiteri debere, quod eius opera stipendio liberatus esset,  quod Aduatucis, finitimis suis, pendere consuesset, quodque ei et filius  et fratris filius ab Caesare remissi essent, quos Aduatuci obsidum  numero missos apud in servitute et catenis tenuissent; neque id, quod  tecerit de oppugnatione castrorum, aut iudicio aut voluntate sua  fecisse, sed coactu civitatis, suaque esse eiusmodi imperia, ut non  minus haberet iuris in se multitudo quam ipse in multitudinem. Civitati  porro hanc fuisse belli causam, quod repentinae Gallorum coniurationi  resistere non potuerit. Id se facile ex humilitate sua probare posse,  quod non adeo sit imperitus rerum ut suis copiis populum Romanum  superari posse confidat. Sed esse Galliae commune consilium: omnibus  hibernis Caesaris oppugnandis hunc esse dictum diem, ne qua legio  alterae legioni subsidio venire posset. Non facile Gallos Gallis negare  potuisse, praesertim cum de recuperanda communi libertate consilium  initum videretur. Quibus quoniam pro pietate satisfecerit, habere nunc  se rationem offici pro beneficiis Caesaris: monere, orare Titurium pro  hospitio, ut suae ac militum saluti consulat. Magnam manum Germanorum  conductam Rhenum transisse; hanc adfore biduo. Ipsorum esse consilium,  velintne priusquam finitimi sentiant eductos ex hibernis milites aut ad  Ciceronem aut ad Labienum deducere, quorum alter milia passuum circiter  quinquaginta, alter paulo amplius ab eis absit. Illud se polliceri et  iureiurando confirmare tutum iter per fines daturum. Quod cum faciat, et  civitati sese consulere, quod hibernis levetur, et Caesari pro eius  meritis gratiam referre. Hac oratione habita discedit Ambiorix.      28    Arpineius et Iunius, quae audierunt, ad legatoc deferunt. Illi repentina  re perturbati, etsi ab hoste ea dicebantur, tamen non neglegenda  existimabant maximeque hac re permovebantur, quod civitatem ignobilem  atque humilem Eburonum sua sponte populo Romano bellum facere ausam vix  erat credendum. Itaque ad consilium rem deferunt magnaque inter eos  exsistit controversia. Lucius Aummculeius compluresque tribuni militum  et primorum ordinum centuriones nihil temere agendum neque ex hibernis  iniussu Caesaris discedendum existimabant: quantasvis [magnas] copias  etiam Germanorum sustineri posse munitis hibernis docebant: rem esse  testimonio, quod primum hostium impetum multis ultro vulneribus illatis  fortissime sustinuerint: re frumentaria non premi; interea et ex  proximis hibernis et a Caesare conventura subsidia: postremo quid esse  levius aut turpius, quam auctore hoste de summis rebus capere consilium?      29    Contra ea Titurius sero facturos clamitabat, cum maiores manus hostium  adiunctis Germanis convenis sent aut cum aliquid calamitatis in proximis  hibernis esset acceptum. Brevem consulendi esse occasionem. Caesarem  arbitrari profcctum in Italiam; neque aiiter Calnutcs interficiendi  Tasgeti consilium fuisse capturos, neque Eburones, si ille adesset,  tanta contemptione nostri ad castra venturos esse. Non hostem auctorem,  sed rem spectare: subesse Rhenum; magno esse Germanis dolori Ariovisti  mortem et superiores nostras victorias; ardere Galliam tot contumeliis  acceptis sub populi Romani imperium redactam superiore gloria rei  militaris exstincta. Postremo quis hoc sibi persuaderet, sine certa re  Ambiorigem ad eiusmodi consilium descendisse? Suam sententiam in  utramque partem esse tutam: si nihil esset durius, nullo cum periculo ad  proximam legionem perventuros; si Gallia omnis cum Germanis consentiret,  unam esse in celeritate positam salutem. Cottae quidem atque eorum, qui  dissentirent, consilium quem habere exitum? In quo si non praesens  periculum, at certe longinqua obsidione fames esset timenda.      30    Hac in utramque partem disputatione habita, cum a Cotta primisque  ordinibus acriter resisteretur, \" Vincite,\" inquit, \" si ita vultis,\"  Sabinus, et id clariore voce, ut magna pars militum exaudiret; \" neque  is sum,\" inquit, \"qui gravissime ex vobis mortis periculo terrear: hi  sapient; si gravius quid acciderit, abs te rationem reposcent, qui, si  per te liceat, perendino die cum proximis hibernis coniuncti communem  cum reliquis belli casum sustineant, non reiecti et relegati longe ab  ceteris aut ferro aut fame intereant.\"      31    Consurgitur ex consilio; comprehendunt utrumque et orant, ne sua  dissensione et pertinacia rem in summum periculum deducat: facilem esse  rem, seu maneant, seu proficiscantur, si modo unum omnes sentiant ac  probent; contra in dissensione nullam se salutem perspicere. Res  disputatione ad mediam noctem perducitur. Tandem dat Cotta permotuc  manus: superat sententia Sabini. Pronuntiatu prima luce ituros.  Consumitur vigiliis reliqua pars noctis, cum sua quisque miles  circumspiceret, quic secum portare posset, quid ex instrumento  hibernorum relinquere cogeretur. Omnia excogitantur, quare nec sine  periculo maneatur, et languore militulr et vigiLus periculum augeatur.  Prima luce sic ex castris proficiscuntur, ut quibus esset persuas non ab  hoste, sed ab homine amicissimo Ambiorige consilium datum, longissimo"]]]
