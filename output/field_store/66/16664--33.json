This    fluid, which in most cells is colorless, is called the cell sap, and    is composed mainly of water. Imbedded in the granular lining of the    sac is a roundish body (_n_), which itself has a definite membrane,    and usually shows one or more roundish bodies within, besides an    indistinctly granular appearance. This body is called the nucleus of    the cell, and the small one within it, the nucleolus.      The membrane surrounding the cell is known as the cell wall, and in    young plant cells is always composed of cellulose.      The granular substance lining the cell wall (Fig. 1, _pr._) is    called \"protoplasm,\" and with the nucleus constitutes the living    part of the cell. If sufficiently magnified, the granules within the    protoplasm will be seen to be in active streaming motion. This    movement, which is very evident here, is not often so conspicuous,    but still may often be detected without difficulty.    [Illustration: FIG. 2.--An _Amoeba_. A cell without a cell wall. _n_,  nucleus; _v_, vacuoles, x 300.]    The cell may be regarded as the unit of organic structure, and of  cells are built up all of the complicated structures of which the  bodies of the highest plants and animals are composed. We shall find  that the cells may become very much modified for various purposes, but  at first they are almost identical in structure, and essentially the  same as the one we have just considered.    [Illustration: FIG. 3.--Hairs from the leaf stalk of a wild geranium.  _A_, single-celled hair. _B_ and _C_, hairs consisting of a row of  cells. The terminal rounded cell secretes a peculiar scented oil that  gives the plant its characteristic odor. _B_, x 50; _C_, x 150.]    Very many of the lower forms of life consist of but a single cell  which may occasionally be destitute of a cell wall. Such a form is  shown in Figure 2. Here we have a mass of protoplasm with a nucleus  (_n_) and cavities (vacuoles, _v_) filled with cell sap, but no cell  wall. The protoplasm is in constant movement, and by extensions of a  portion of the mass and contraction of other parts, the whole creeps  slowly along. Other naked cells (Fig. 12, _B_; Fig. 16, _C_) are  provided with delicate thread-like processes of protoplasm called  \"cilia\" (sing. _cilium_), which are in active vibration, and propel  the cell through the water.    [Illustration: FIG. 4.--_A_, cross section. _B_, longitudinal section  of the leaf stalk of wild geranium, showing its cellular structure.  _Ep._ epidermis. _h_, a hair, x 50. _C_, a cell from the prothallium  (young plant) of a fern, x _150_. The contents of the cell contracted  by the action of a solution of sugar.]      On placing a cell into a fluid denser than the cell sap (_e.g._ a    ten-per-cent solution of sugar in water), a portion of the water    will be extracted from the cell, and we shall then see the    protoplasm receding from the wall (Fig. 4, _C_), showing that it is    normally in a state of tension due to pressure from within of the    cell sap. The cell wall shows the same thing though in a less    degree, owing to its being much more rigid than the protoplasmic    lining. It is owing to the partial collapsing of the cells,    consequent on loss of water, that plants wither when the supply of    water is cut off.    As cells grow, new ones are formed in various ways. If the new cells  remain together, cell aggregates, called tissues, are produced, and  of these tissues are built up the various organs of the higher plants.  The simplest tissues are rows of cells, such as form the hairs  covering the surface of the organs of many flowering plants (Fig. 3),  and are due to a division of the cells in a single direction. If the  divisions take place in three planes, masses of cells, such as make up  the stems, etc., of the higher plants, result (Fig. 4, _A_, _B_).          CHAPTER III.    CLASSIFICATION OF PLANTS.--PROTOPHYTES.      For the sake of convenience it is desirable to collect into groups  such plants as are evidently related; but as our knowledge of many  forms is still very imperfect, any classification we may adopt must be  to a great extent only provisional, and subject to change at any time,  as new forms are discovered or others become better understood.    The following general divisions are usually accepted: I. Sub-kingdom  (or Branch); II. Class; III. Order; IV. Family; V. Genus; VI. Species.    To illustrate: The white pine belongs to the highest great division  (sub-kingdom) of the plant kingdom. The plants of this division all  produce seeds, and hence are called \"spermaphytes\" (\"seed plants\").  They may be divided into two groups (classes), distinguished by  certain peculiarities in the flowers and seeds. These are named  respectively \"gymnosperms\" and \"angiosperms,\" and to the first our  plant belongs. The gymnosperms may be further divided into several  subordinate groups (orders), one of which, the conifers, or  cone-bearing evergreens, includes our plant. This order includes  several families, among them the fir family (_Abietineae_), including  the pines and firs. Of the sub-divisions (_genera_, sing. _genus_) of  the fir family, one of the most familiar is the genus _Pinus_, which  embraces all the true pines. Comparing different kinds of pines, we  find that they differ in the form of the cones, arrangement of the  leaves, and other minor particulars. The form we have selected differs  from all other native forms in its cones, and also in having the  leaves in fives, instead of twos or threes, as in most other kinds.  Therefore to distinguish the white pine from all other pines, it is  given a \"specific\" name, _strobus_.    The following table will show more plainly what is meant:                               Sub-kingdom,                          _Spermaphyta_.           /--------------------^---------------------\\            Includes all spermaphytes, or seed plants.

The name Protophytes (_Protophyta_) has been applied to a large number  of simple plants, which differ a good deal among themselves. Some of  them differ strikingly from the higher plants, and resemble so  remarkably certain low forms of animal life as to be quite  indistinguishable from them, at least in certain stages. Indeed, there  are certain forms that are quite as much animal as vegetable in their  attributes, and must be regarded as connecting the two kingdoms. Such  forms are the slime moulds (Fig. 5), _Euglena_ (Fig. 9), _Volvox_  (Fig. 10), and others.    [Illustration: FIG. 5.--_A_, a portion of a slime mould growing on a  bit of rotten wood, x 3. _B_, outline of a part of the same, x 25.  _C_, a small portion showing the densely granular character of the  protoplasm, x 150. _D_, a group of spore cases of a slime mould  (_Trichia_), of about the natural size. _E_, two spore cases, x 5.

The protophytes may be divided into three classes: I. The slime moulds  (_Myxomycetes_); II. The Schizophytes; III. The green monads  (_Volvocineae_).      CLASS I.--THE SLIME MOULDS.    These curious organisms are among the most puzzling forms with which  the botanist has to do, as they are so much like some of the lowest  forms of animal life as to be scarcely distinguishable from them, and  indeed they are sometimes regarded as animals rather than plants. At  certain stages they consist of naked masses of protoplasm of very  considerable size, not infrequently several centimetres in diameter.  These are met with on decaying logs in damp woods, on rotting leaves,  and other decaying vegetable matter. The commonest ones are bright  yellow or whitish, and form soft, slimy coverings over the substratum  (Fig. 5, _A_), penetrating into its crevices and showing sensitiveness  toward light. The plasmodium, as the mass of protoplasm is called, may  be made to creep upon a slide in the following way: A tumbler is  filled with water and placed in a saucer filled with sand. A strip of  blotting paper about the width of the slide is now placed with one end  in the water, the other hanging over the edge of the glass and against  one side of a slide, which is thus held upright, but must not be  allowed to touch the side of the tumbler. The strip of blotting paper  sucks up the water, which flows slowly down the surface of the slide  in contact with the blotting paper. If now a bit of the substance upon  which the plasmodium is growing is placed against the bottom of the  slide on the side where the stream of water is, the protoplasm will  creep up against the current of water and spread over the slide,  forming delicate threads in which most active"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20394"],[0,"Correspondence Relating to Executions in Turkey for Apostacy from Islamism (#3)"],[1,"custom had mitigated the rigour of a law so little in harmony  with the precepts of civilization, and for a number of years no  execution of this kind had taken place. That of the unfortunate  Serkiz must therefore be considered as a sad return to the barbarity  of Mahomedan fanaticism. It must be so much the more so because, on  the one hand, the energetic intercession of Sir Stratford Canning in  behalf of the victim was fruitless; and because, on the other, the  Turkish authorities, in leading Serkiz, although he was an Armenian,  in the Frank costume and with a cap upon his head to execution, seem  to have wished to give to this bloody spectacle the character of a  public defiance offered by the old Mahomedan cruelty to the  influence of European manners and Christian civilization.    Setting out from this view of the case and looking upon the  catastrophe which has just taken place as a fresh symptom of the  retrograde, and it may be said anti-European, tendency from which it  is important that the Turkish Government should, in its own  interest, be diverted, the Representatives of the Five Great Powers  at Constantinople thought that a joint representation, at once kind  and earnest, which those Powers should make for this purpose to the  Sublime Porte, would produce a salutary impression upon it. They,  therefore, and at the special request of Sir Stratford Canning,  applied to their respective Courts for the instructions necessary to  enable them to take the step in question, and the English Ambassador  wished moreover to propose to Lord Aberdeen to communicate in the  same sense with the Cabinets of Berlin, Vienna, Paris, and St.  Petersburgh.    I have not yet received any communication upon this subject from the  Principal Secretary of State; but I lost no time in replying by the  despatch of which I inclose a copy, to that which the Envoy of the  King at Constantinople addressed to His Majesty respecting this  affair.    Have the goodness, Sir, to communicate it, as well as this despatch,  to Lord Aberdeen, and to express to his Lordship, on my part, the  hope that I have in this manner anticipated the overtures which he  would perhaps have caused to be made to me with reference to the  step proposed by the Five Representatives at Constantinople, but  especially suggested by the English Ambassador.    Accept, &c.,    (Signed) BULOW    Inclosure 2 in No. 3.    _Baron Bülow to M. Le Coq_.    Monsieur,                         _Berlin, ce_ 20 _Septembre_, 1843.    Vos rapports au Roi, &c., &c.    Ce que vous avez mandé sur l'exécution de l'Arménien Serkiz  Papazoghlou n'a pu manquer de nous inspirer un intérêt aussi vif que  douloureux. En effet tous les détails de cette sanglante catastrophe  sont bien de nature à mériter la sérieuse attention des Puissances  Européennes. Ce sont autant de symptômes d'une tendance rétrograde à  laquelle la Sublime Porte paraît s'être abandonnée depuis quelques  années, et qui, en tolérant et en favorisant peut-être même les  excès du fanatisme Musulman, est aussi contraire aux lois de  l'humanité qu'aux règles qu'une saine politique devrait dicter au  Gouvernement Ottoman.    A en juger d'après les circonstances qui ont précédé, accompagné et  suivi la mort de cette malheureuse victime de la rigueur Mahométane,  ne serait-on pas tenté de croire que ce Gouvernement a oublié ce  qu'il doit aux efforts réunis des Grandes Puissances, à leurs  conseils désintéressés, à la salutaire influence de la civilisation  Européenne? Ne semble-t-il pas, en opposant aux moeurs plus douces  qui sont la suite de cette civilisation la lettre impitoyable du  Coran, avoir l'intention de faire sentir à l'Europe entière le peu  de cas qu'il fait du bienveillant intérêt, de la constante  sollicitude que lui ont voués les Cabinets Européens,    Or, les graves conséquences, qu'un pareil sytème [sic] entraînerait  pour la Porte, en finissant par lui aliéner réellement l'intérêt de  ces Cabinets, sont si évidentes, que nous aimons à croire qu'un  avertissement unanime de leur part suffira pour la détourner d'une  voie également désastreuse sous le point de vue politique et moral.  Je me range sous ce rapport entièrement à l'avis de Sir Stratford  Canning, et après avoir pris les ordres du Roi, notre Auguste  Maître, je vous invite, Monsieur, à vous associer à la démarche que,  je n'en doute pas, Messieurs vos collègues d'Autriche, de France et  de Russie seront également autorisés à faire à cet effet auprès du  Gouvernement Turc en commun avec M. l'Ambassadeur d'Angleterre. Dans  cette occasion où les Représentans des Cinq Grandes Puissances  agiront en quelque sorte comme organes de la civilisation  Européenne, il importera surtout de constater leur unanimité.  Veuillez par ce motif, Monsieur, attendre que les instructions que  Messieurs vos collègues ont sollicitées, leur soient parvenues, et  alors vous concerter avec eux sur la meilleure forme à donner à la  démarche qu'elles prescrivent. Si contre toute attente ces  instructions n'étaient pas de nature à établir un accord entier des  Cinq Puissances dans cette affaire, vous voudrez bien, Monsieur,  m'en informer, pour que je puisse, selon les circonstances, vous  faire parvenir des directions ultérieures. En tout cas la démarche  en question devra se borner à être simultanée et non pas collective,  et le langage que vous tiendrez à la Porte, pour être sérieux et  ferme, ne s'en tiendra pas moins dans les bornes d'un conseil  amical, et évitera tout ce qui pourrait blesser la susceptibilité  politique et religieuse du Gouvernement Ottoman.    Nous n'avons pas encore reçu la communication à laquelle nous  pouvons nous attendre de la part de Lord Aberdeen, en suite de la  demande que Sir Stratford Canning lui a adressée au sujet de  l'affaire qui fait l'objet de la présente dépêche. Mais j'envoie une  copie de cette dernière à l'Envoyé du Roi à Londres, pour en donner  connaissance à M. le Principal Secrétaire d'Etat, et pour informer  de cette manière sa Seigneurie que, d'accord avec Sir Stratford  Canning sur l'opportunité de la démarche qu'il a proposée, le  Cabinet du Roi s'est empressé de vous autoriser à y concourir.    Recevez, &c.,    (Signé) BULOW.    (Translation.)    Sir,                              _Berlin, September_ 20, 1843.    Your reports to the King, &c. &c.    The account which you have given of the execution of the Armenian  Serkiz Papazoghlou could not fail to excite our lively and painful  interest. Indeed all the details of this bloody catastrophe are well  calculated to deserve the serious attention of the European Powers.  They are so many symptoms of a retrograde tendency to which the  Sublime Porte appears to have given itself up for some years past,  and which, by tolerating, and perhaps even encouraging the excesses  of Mahomedan fanaticism, is as contrary to the laws of humanity as  to the rules which a wholesome policy should dictate to the Turkish  Government.    To judge from the circumstances which preceded, attended, and  followed the death of this unhappy victim of Mahomedan severity,  should we not be tempted to think that that Government has forgotten  what it owes to the united exertions of the Great Powers, to their  disinterested advice, and to the salutary influence of European  civilization? Does it not appear, by placing in opposition to the  milder customs which are the result of that civilization the  inexorable letter of the Koran, to intend to make the whole of  Europe feel the little importance which it attaches to the  benevolent interest and the constant solicitude with which the  European Cabinets have regarded it?    Wherefore, the serious consequences, which such a system would  entail upon the Porte, by finally alienating from it in reality the  interest of those Cabinets, are so evident, that we are fain to  believe that an unanimous intimation on their part will suffice to  turn it aside from a course equally disastrous in a political and in  a moral point of view. I side entirely in this respect with the  opinion of Sir Stratford Canning, and after having taken the orders  of the King, our august Master, I request you, Sir, to join in the  step which I doubt not your colleagues of Austria, France and Russia  will be equally authorized to take to this effect towards the  Turkish Government, in common with the Ambassador of England. On  this occasion when the Representatives of the Five Powers will act  in some manner as the organs of European civilization, it will above  all things be important to evince their unanimity. For this reason,  have the goodness, Sir, to wait until the instructions for which  your colleagues have applied, have reached them, and thereupon  concert with them as to the best form to be given to the step which  those instructions prescribe. If, contrary to all expectation, those  instructions should not be such as to demonstrate an entire  agreement of the Five Powers on this matter, you will have the  goodness, Sir, to inform me of the fact, in order that I may,  according to circumstances, transmit to you further instructions. In  any case the step in question should be limited to being  simultaneous and not collective, and the language which you will  hold to the Porte, while it is serious and firm, must not the less  be confined within the bounds of friendly counsel, and must avoid  everything that could wound the political and religious  susceptibility of the Ottoman Government.    We have not yet received the communication which we may expect from  Lord Aberdeen, in pursuance of the application made to him by Sir  Stratford Canning, on the subject of the matter treated of in this  despatch. But I send a copy of this last to the King's Envoy in  London, in order that he may communicate it to the Principal  Secretary of State, and in this manner acquaint his Lordship that  the King's Cabinet, agreeing with Sir Stratford Canning as to the  fitness of the"]]]
