Only a portion of the back was visible to the  ape-man, the rest of the body being lost in the dense shadows beneath  the tree, from whence there now arose the sound of giant jaws  powerfully crunching flesh and bones. From the odors that rose to the  ape-man's sensitive nostrils he presently realized that beneath him was  some huge reptile feeding upon the carcass of the lion that had been  slain there earlier in the night.    As Tarzan's eyes, straining with curiosity, bored futilely into the  dark shadows he felt a light touch upon his shoulder, and, turning, saw  that his companion was attempting to attract his attention. The  creature, pressing a forefinger to his own lips as to enjoin silence,  attempted by pulling on Tarzan's arm to indicate that they should leave  at once.    Realizing that he was in a strange country, evidently infested by  creatures of titanic size, with the habits and powers of which he was  entirely unfamiliar, the ape-man permitted himself to be drawn away.  With the utmost caution the pithecanthropus descended the tree upon the  opposite side from the great nocturnal prowler, and, closely followed  by Tarzan, moved silently away through the night across the plain.    The ape-man was rather loath thus to relinquish an opportunity to  inspect a creature which he realized was probably entirely different  from anything in his past experience; yet he was wise enough to know  when discretion was the better part of valor and now, as in the past,  he yielded to that law which dominates the kindred of the wild,  preventing them from courting danger uselessly, whose lives are  sufficiently filled with danger in their ordinary routine of feeding  and mating.    As the rising sun dispelled the shadows of the night, Tarzan found  himself again upon the verge of a great forest into which his guide  plunged, taking nimbly to the branches of the trees through which he  made his way with the celerity of long habitude and hereditary  instinct, but though aided by a prehensile tail, fingers, and toes, the  man-thing moved through the forest with no greater ease or surety than  did the giant ape-man.    It was during this journey that Tarzan recalled the wound in his side  inflicted upon him the previous night by the raking talons of Numa, the  lion, and examining it was surprised to discover that not only was it  painless but along its edges were no indications of inflammation, the  results doubtless of the antiseptic powder his strange companion had  sprinkled upon it.    They had proceeded for a mile or two when Tarzan's companion came to  earth upon a grassy slope beneath a great tree whose branches overhung  a clear brook. Here they drank and Tarzan discovered the water to be  not only deliciously pure and fresh but of an icy temperature that  indicated its rapid descent from the lofty mountains of its origin.    Casting aside his loin cloth and weapons Tarzan entered the little pool  beneath the tree and after a moment emerged, greatly refreshed and  filled with a keen desire to breakfast. As he came out of the pool he  noticed his companion examining him with a puzzled expression upon his  face. Taking the ape-man by the shoulder he turned him around so that  Tarzan's back was toward him and then, touching the end of Tarzan's  spine with his forefinger, he curled his own tail up over his shoulder  and, wheeling the ape-man about again, pointed first at Tarzan and then  at his own caudal appendage, a look of puzzlement upon his face, the  while he jabbered excitedly in his strange tongue.    The ape-man realized that probably for the first time his companion had  discovered that he was tailless by nature rather than by accident, and  so he called attention to his own great toes and thumbs to further  impress upon the creature that they were of different species.    The fellow shook his head dubiously as though entirely unable to  comprehend why Tarzan should differ so from him but at last, apparently  giving the problem up with a shrug, he laid aside his own harness,  skin, and weapons and entered the pool.    His ablutions completed and his meager apparel redonned he seated  himself at the foot of the tree and motioning Tarzan to a place beside  him, opened the pouch that hung at his right side taking from it strips  of dried flesh and a couple of handfuls of thin-shelled nuts with which  Tarzan was unfamiliar. Seeing the other break them with his teeth and  eat the kernel, Tarzan followed the example thus set him, discovering  the meat to be rich and well flavored. The dried flesh also was far  from unpalatable, though it had evidently been jerked without salt, a  commodity which Tarzan imagined might be rather difficult to obtain in  this locality.    As they ate Tarzan's companion pointed to the nuts, the dried meat, and  various other nearby objects, in each instance repeating what Tarzan  readily discovered must be the names of these things in the creature's  native language. The ape-man could but smile at this evident desire  upon the part of his new-found acquaintance to impart to him  instructions that eventually might lead to an exchange of thoughts  between them. Having already mastered several languages and a multitude  of dialects the ape-man felt that he could readily assimilate another  even though this appeared one entirely unrelated to any with which he  was familiar.    So occupied were they with their breakfast and the lesson that neither  was aware of the beady eyes glittering down upon them from above; nor  was Tarzan cognizant of any impending danger until the instant that a  huge, hairy body leaped full upon his companion from the branches above  them.        2    \"To the Death!\"    In the moment of discovery Tarzan saw that the creature was almost a  counterpart of his companion in size and conformation, with the  exception that his body was entirely clothed with a coat of shaggy  black hair which almost concealed his features, while his harness and  weapons were similar to those of the creature he had attacked. Ere  Tarzan could prevent the creature had struck the ape-man's companion a  blow upon the head with his knotted club that felled him, unconscious,  to the earth; but before he could inflict further injury upon his  defenseless prey the ape-man had closed with him.    Instantly Tarzan realized that he was locked with a creature of almost  superhuman strength. The sinewy fingers of a powerful hand sought his  throat while the other lifted the bludgeon above his head. But if the  strength of the hairy attacker was great, great too was that of his  smooth-skinned antagonist. Swinging a single terrific blow with  clenched fist to the point of the other's chin, Tarzan momentarily  staggered his assailant and then his own fingers closed upon the shaggy  throat, as with the other hand he seized the wrist of the arm that  swung the club. With equal celerity he shot his right leg behind the  shaggy brute and throwing his weight forward hurled the thing over his  hip heavily to the ground, at the same time precipitating his own body  upon the other's chest.    With the shock of the impact the club fell from the brute's hand and  Tarzan's hold was wrenched from its throat. Instantly the two were  locked in a deathlike embrace. Though the creature bit at Tarzan the  latter was quickly aware that this was not a particularly formidable  method of offense or defense, since its canines were scarcely more  developed than his own. The thing that he had principally to guard  against was the sinuous tail which sought steadily to wrap itself about  his throat and against which experience had afforded him no defense.    Struggling and snarling the two rolled growling about the sward at the  foot of the tree, first one on top and then the other but each more  occupied at present in defending his throat from the other's choking  grasp than in aggressive, offensive tactics. But presently the ape-man  saw his opportunity and as they rolled about he forced the creature  closer and closer to the pool, upon the banks of which the battle was  progressing. At last they lay upon the very verge of the water and now  it remained for Tarzan to precipitate them both beneath the surface but  in such a way that he might remain on top.    At the same instant there came within range of Tarzan's vision, just  behind the prostrate form of his companion, the crouching, devil-faced  figure of the striped saber-tooth hybrid, eyeing him with snarling,  malevolent face.    Almost simultaneously Tarzan's shaggy antagonist discovered the  menacing figure of the great cat. Immediately he ceased his belligerent  activities against Tarzan and, jabbering and chattering to the ape-man,  he tried to disengage himself from Tarzan's hold but in such a way that  indicated that as far as he was concerned their battle was over.  Appreciating the danger to his unconscious companion and being anxious  to protect him from the saber-tooth the ape-man relinquished his hold  upon his adversary and together the two rose to their feet.    Drawing his knife Tarzan moved slowly toward the body of his companion,  expecting that his recent antagonist would grasp the opportunity for  escape. To his surprise, however, the beast, after regaining its club,  advanced at his side.    The great cat, flattened upon its belly, remained motionless except for  twitching tail and snarling lips where it lay perhaps fifty feet beyond  the body of the pithecanthropus. As Tarzan stepped over the body of the  latter he saw the eyelids quiver and open, and in his heart he felt a  strange sense of relief that the creature was not dead and a  realization that without his suspecting it there had arisen within his  savage bosom a bond of attachment for this strange new friend.    Tarzan continued to approach the saber-tooth, nor did the shaggy beast  at his right lag behind.

The original manuscript  thus found its way to the Le Veillard family and connections, where it  remained until sold in 1867 to Mr. John Bigelow, United States  Minister to France. By him it was later sold to Mr. E. Dwight Church  of New York, and passed with the rest of Mr. Church's library into the  possession of Mr. Henry E. Huntington. The original manuscript of  Franklin's _Autobiography_ now rests in the vault in Mr. Huntington's  residence at Fifth Avenue and Fifty-seventh Street, New York City.    When Mr. Bigelow came to examine his purchase, he was astonished to  find that what people had been reading for years as the authentic  _Life of Benjamin Franklin by Himself_, was only a garbled and  incomplete version of the real _Autobiography_. Temple Franklin had  taken unwarranted liberties with the original. Mr. Bigelow says he  found more than twelve hundred changes in the text. In 1868,  therefore, Mr. Bigelow published the standard edition of Franklin's  _Autobiography_. It corrected errors in the previous editions and was  the first English edition to contain the short fourth part,  comprising the last few pages of the manuscript, written during the  last year of Franklin's life. Mr. Bigelow republished the  _Autobiography_, with additional interesting matter, in three volumes  in 1875, in 1905, and in 1910. The text in this volume is that of Mr.  Bigelow's editions.[2]        [2] For the division into chapters and the chapter      titles, however, the present editor is responsible.    The _Autobiography_ has been reprinted in the United States many  scores of times and translated into all the languages of Europe. It  has never lost its popularity and is still in constant demand at  circulating libraries. The reason for this popularity is not far to  seek. For in this work Franklin told in a remarkable manner the story  of a remarkable life. He displayed hard common sense and a practical  knowledge of the art of living. He selected and arranged his material,  perhaps unconsciously, with the unerring instinct of the journalist  for the best effects. His success is not a little due to his plain,  clear, vigorous English. He used short sentences and words, homely  expressions, apt illustrations, and pointed allusions. Franklin had a  most interesting, varied, and unusual life. He was one of the greatest  conversationalists of his time.    His book is the record of that unusual life told in Franklin's own  unexcelled conversational style. It is said that the best parts of  Boswell's famous biography of Samuel Johnson are those parts where  Boswell permits Johnson to tell his own story. In the _Autobiography_  a no less remarkable man and talker than Samuel Johnson is telling his  own story throughout.    F. W. P.    The Gilman Country School,  Baltimore, September, 1916.

Dear son: I have ever had pleasure in obtaining any little anecdotes  of my ancestors. You may remember the inquiries I made among the  remains of my relations when you were with me in England, and the  journey I undertook for that purpose. Imagining it may be equally  agreeable to you to know the circumstances of my life, many of which  you are yet unacquainted with, and expecting the enjoyment of a week's  uninterrupted leisure in my present country retirement, I sit down to  write them for you. To which I have besides some other inducements.  Having emerged from the poverty and obscurity in which I was born and  bred, to a state of affluence and some degree of reputation in the  world, and having gone so far through life with a considerable share  of felicity, the conducing means I made use of, which with the  blessing of God so well succeeded, my posterity may like to know, as  they may find some of them suitable to their own situations, and  therefore fit to be imitated.        [3] A small village not far from Winchester in      Hampshire, southern England. Here was the country seat      of the Bishop of St. Asaph, Dr. Jonathan Shipley, the      \"good Bishop,\" as Dr. Franklin used to style him. Their      relations were intimate and confidential. In his pulpit,      and in the House of Lords, as well as in society, the      bishop always opposed the harsh measures of the Crown      toward the Colonies.--Bigelow.    That felicity, when I reflected on it, has induced me sometimes to  say, that were it offered to my choice, I should have no objection to  a repetition of the same life from its beginning, only asking the  advantages authors have in a second edition to correct some faults of  the first. So I might, besides correcting the faults, change some  sinister accidents and events of it for others more favourable. But  though this were denied, I should still accept the offer. Since such a  repetition is not to be expected, the next thing most like living  one's life over again seems to be a recollection of that life, and to  make that recollection as durable as possible by putting it down in  writing.    Hereby, too, I shall indulge the inclination so natural in old men, to  be talking of themselves and their own past actions; and I shall  indulge it without being tiresome to others, who, through respect to  age, might conceive themselves obliged to give me a hearing, since  this may be read or not as anyone pleases. And, lastly (I may as well  confess it, since my denial of it will be believed by nobody), perhaps  I shall a good deal gratify my own _vanity_.[4] Indeed, I scarce ever  heard or saw the introductory words, \"_Without vanity I may say_,\"  etc., but some vain thing immediately followed. Most people dislike  vanity in others, whatever share they have of it themselves; but I  give it fair quarter wherever I meet with it, being persuaded that it  is often productive of good to the possessor, and to others that are  within his sphere of action; and therefore, in many cases, it would  not be altogether absurd if a man were to thank God for his vanity  among the other comforts of life.        [4] In this connection Woodrow Wilson says, \"And yet the      surprising and delightful thing about this book (the      _Autobiography_) is that, take it all in all, it has not      the low tone of conceit, but is a staunch man's sober      and unaffected assessment of himself and the      circumstances of his career.\"        Gibbon and Hume, the great British historians, who were      contemporaries of Franklin, express in their      autobiographies the same feeling about the propriety of      just self-praise.    And now I speak of thanking God, I desire with all humility to  acknowledge that I owe the mentioned happiness of my past life to His  kind providence, which lead me to the means I used and gave them  success. My belief of this induces me to _hope_, though I must not  _presume_, that the same goodness will still be exercised toward me,  in continuing that happiness, or enabling me to bear a fatal reverse,  which I may experience as others have done; the complexion of my  future fortune being known to Him only in whose power it is to bless  to us even our afflictions.    The notes one of my uncles (who had the same kind of curiosity in  collecting family anecdotes) once put into my hands, furnished me with  several particulars relating to our ancestors. From these notes I  learned that the family had lived in the same village, Ecton, in  Northamptonshire,[5] for three hundred years, and how much longer he  knew not (perhaps from the time when the name of Franklin, that before  was the name of an order of people,[6] was assumed by them as a  surname when others took surnames all over the kingdom), on a freehold  of about thirty acres, aided by the smith's business, which had  continued in the family till his time, the eldest son being always  bred to that business; a custom which he and my father followed as to  their eldest sons. When I searched the registers at Ecton, I found an  account of their births, marriages and burials from the year 1555  only, there being no registers kept in that parish at any time  preceding. By that register I perceived that I was the youngest son of  the youngest son for five generations back. My grandfather Thomas, who  was born in 1598, lived at Ecton till he grew too old to follow  business longer, when he went to live with his son John, a dyer at  Banbury, in Oxfordshire, with whom my father served an apprenticeship.  There my grandfather died and lies buried. We saw his gravestone in  1758. His eldest son Thomas lived in the house at Ecton, and left it  with the land to his only child, a daughter, who, with her husband,  one Fisher, of Wellingborough, sold it to Mr. Isted, now lord of the  manor there. My grandfather had four sons that grew up, viz.: Thomas,  John, Benjamin and Josiah. I will give you what account I can of them  at this distance from my papers, and if these are not lost in my  absence, you will among them find many more particulars.

Thomas was bred a smith under his father; but, being ingenious, and  encouraged in learning (as all my brothers were) by an Esquire Palmer,  then the principal gentleman in that parish, he qualified himself for  the business of scrivener; became a considerable man in the county;  was a chief mover of all public-spirited undertakings for the county  or town of Northampton, and his own village, of which many instances  were related of him; and much taken notice of and patronized by the"]]]
