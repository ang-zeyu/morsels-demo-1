And hence it is clear  that the principle of human acts, in so far as they are human, is the  end. In like manner it is their terminus: for the human act  terminates at that which the will intends as the end; thus in natural  agents the form of the thing generated is conformed to the form of  the generator. And since, as Ambrose says (Prolog. super Luc.)  \"morality is said properly of man,\" moral acts properly speaking  receive their species from the end, for moral acts are the same as  human acts.    Reply Obj. 1: The end is not altogether extrinsic to the act, because  it is related to the act as principle or terminus; and thus it just  this that is essential to an act, viz. to proceed from something,  considered as action, and to proceed towards something, considered as  passion.    Reply Obj. 2: The end, in so far as it pre-exists in the intention,  pertains to the will, as stated above (A. 1, ad 1). And it is thus  that it gives the species to the human or moral act.    Reply Obj. 3: One and the same act, in so far as it proceeds  once from the agent, is ordained to but one proximate end, from which  it has its species: but it can be ordained to several remote ends, of  which one is the end of the other. It is possible, however, that an  act which is one in respect of its natural species, be ordained to  several ends of the will: thus this act \"to kill a man,\" which is but  one act in respect of its natural species, can be ordained, as to an  end, to the safeguarding of justice, and to the satisfying of anger:  the result being that there would be several acts in different species  of morality: since in one way there will be an act of virtue, in  another, an act of vice. For a movement does not receive its species  from that which is its terminus accidentally, but only from that which  is its _per se_ terminus. Now moral ends are accidental to a natural  thing, and conversely the relation to a natural end is accidental to  morality. Consequently there is no reason why acts which are the same  considered in their natural species, should not be diverse, considered  in their moral species, and conversely.  ________________________    FOURTH ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 1, Art. 4]    Whether There Is One Last End of Human Life?    Objection 1: It would seem that there is no last end of human life,  but that we proceed to infinity. For good is essentially diffusive, as  Dionysius states (Div. Nom. iv). Consequently if that which proceeds  from good is itself good, the latter must needs diffuse some other  good: so that the diffusion of good goes on indefinitely. But good has  the nature of an end. Therefore there is an indefinite series of ends.    Obj. 2: Further, things pertaining to the reason can be multiplied to  infinity: thus mathematical quantities have no limit. For the same  reason the species of numbers are infinite, since, given any number,  the reason can think of one yet greater. But desire of the end is  consequent on the apprehension of the reason. Therefore it seems that  there is also an infinite series of ends.    Obj. 3: Further, the good and the end is the object of the will. But  the will can react on itself an infinite number of times: for I can  will something, and will to will it, and so on indefinitely.  Therefore there is an infinite series of ends of the human will, and  there is no last end of the human will.    _On the contrary,_ The Philosopher says (Metaph. ii, 2) that \"to  suppose a thing to be indefinite is to deny that it is good.\" But the  good is that which has the nature of an end. Therefore it is contrary  to the nature of an end to proceed indefinitely. Therefore it is  necessary to fix one last end.    _I answer that,_ Absolutely speaking, it is not possible to proceed  indefinitely in the matter of ends, from any point of view. For in  whatsoever things there is an essential order of one to another, if  the first be removed, those that are ordained to the first, must of  necessity be removed also. Wherefore the Philosopher proves (Phys.  viii, 5) that we cannot proceed to infinitude in causes of movement,  because then there would be no first mover, without which neither can  the others move, since they move only through being moved by the first  mover. Now there is to be observed a twofold order in ends--the order  of intention and the order of execution: and in either of these orders  there must be something first. For that which is first in the order of  intention, is the principle, as it were, moving the appetite;  consequently, if you remove this principle, there will be nothing to  move the appetite. On the other hand, the principle in execution is  that wherein operation has its beginning; and if this principle be  taken away, no one will begin to work. Now the principle in the  intention is the last end; while the principle in execution is the  first of the things which are ordained to the end. Consequently, on  neither side is it possible to go to infinity since if there were no  last end, nothing would be desired, nor would any action have its  term, nor would the intention of the agent be at rest; while if there  is no first thing among those that are ordained to the end, none would  begin to work at anything, and counsel would have no term, but would  continue indefinitely.    On the other hand, nothing hinders infinity from being in things that  are ordained to one another not essentially but accidentally; for  accidental causes are indeterminate. And in this way it happens that  there is an accidental infinity of ends, and of things ordained to the  end.    Reply Obj. 1: The very nature of good is that something flows from  it, but not that it flows from something else. Since, therefore, good  has the nature of end, and the first good is the last end, this  argument does not prove that there is no last end; but that from the  end, already supposed, we may proceed downwards indefinitely towards  those things that are ordained to the end. And this would be true if  we considered but the power of the First Good, which is infinite.  But, since the First Good diffuses itself according to the intellect,  to which it is proper to flow forth into its effects according to a  certain fixed form; it follows that there is a certain measure to the  flow of good things from the First Good from Which all other goods  share the power of diffusion. Consequently the diffusion of goods  does not proceed indefinitely but, as it is written (Wis. 11:21), God  disposes all things \"in number, weight and measure.\"    Reply Obj. 2: In things which are of themselves, reason begins from  principles that are known naturally, and advances to some term.  Wherefore the Philosopher proves (Poster. i, 3) that there is no  infinite process in demonstrations, because there we find a process  of things having an essential, not an accidental, connection with one  another. But in those things which are accidentally connected,  nothing hinders the reason from proceeding indefinitely. Now it is  accidental to a stated quantity or number, as such, that quantity or  unity be added to it. Wherefore in such like things nothing hinders  the reason from an indefinite process.    Reply Obj. 3: This multiplication of acts of the will reacting on  itself, is accidental to the order of ends. This is clear from the  fact that in regard to one and the same end, the will reacts on  itself indifferently once or several times.  ________________________    FIFTH ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 1, Art. 5]    Whether One Man Can Have Several Last Ends?    Objection 1: It would seem possible for one man's will to be directed  at the same time to several things, as last ends. For Augustine says  (De Civ. Dei xix, 1) that some held man's last end to consist in four  things, viz. \"in pleasure, repose, the gifts of nature, and virtue.\"  But these are clearly more than one thing. Therefore one man can place  the last end of his will in many things.    Obj. 2: Further, things not in opposition to one another do not  exclude one another. Now there are many things which are not in  opposition to one another. Therefore the supposition that one thing  is the last end of the will does not exclude others.    Obj. 3: Further, by the fact that it places its last end in one  thing, the will does not lose its freedom. But before it placed its  last end in that thing, e.g. pleasure, it could place it in something  else, e.g. riches. Therefore even after having placed his last end in  pleasure, a man can at the same time place his last end in riches.  Therefore it is possible for one man's will to be directed at the  same time to several things, as last ends.    _On the contrary,_ That in which a man rests as in his last end, is  master of his affections, since he takes therefrom his entire rule of  life. Hence of gluttons it is written (Phil. 3:19): \"Whose god is  their belly\": viz. because they place their last end in the pleasures  of the belly. Now according to Matt. 6:24, \"No man can serve two  masters,\" such, namely, as are not ordained to one another. Therefore  it is impossible for one man to have several last ends not ordained  to one another.    _I answer that,_ It is impossible for one man's will to be directed  at the same time to diverse things, as last ends. Three reasons may  be assigned for this. First, because, since everything desires its  own perfection, a man desires for his ultimate end, that which he  desires as his perfect and crowning good. Hence Augustine (De Civ.  Dei xix, 1): \"In speaking of the end of good we mean now, not that it  passes away so as to be no more, but that it is perfected so as to be  complete.\" It is therefore necessary for the last end so to fill  man's appetite, that nothing is left besides it for man to desire.  Which is not possible, if something else be required for his  perfection. Consequently it is not possible for the appetite so to  tend to two things, as though each were its perfect good.    The "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17910"],[0,"The Mafulu: Mountain People of British New Guinea (#3)"],[1,"New  Guinea,\" _Journ. Roy. Geog. Soc._, 1900, pp. 265, 414). Dr. Seligmann,  in his valuable paper \"A Classification of the Natives of British  New Guinea\" (_Journ. Roy. Anth. Inst._, XXXIX., 1909, pp. 246, 315)  corroborated these views and designated the two groups of \"Melanesians\"  as the Eastern and Western Papuo-Melanesians. The following year he  published the great book to which Mr. Williamson so frequently refers,  and in which this classification is maintained, and these two groups  together with the Papuans, are termed Papuasians.    The Motu stock of the Western Papuo-Melanesians have extended  their dispersal as far as the Mekeo district, where they came  into contact with other peoples. It has been shown that the true  Papuans are a narrow-headed people, but there are some puzzling  exceptions, the explanation of which is not yet ascertained. The  Papuo-Melanesians contain a somewhat broad-headed element, and  there is a slightly broad-headed population in the central range  of the south-east peninsula, the extent of which has not yet been  determined. The questions naturally arise: (1) Is the true Papuan a  variable stock including both long- broad-headed elements? or (2)  Does the broad-headed element belong to an immigrant people? or,  again (3) Is there an hitherto unidentified indigenous broad-headed  race? I doubt if the time is ripe for a definite answer to any of  these questions. Furthermore, we have yet to assign to their original  sources the differences in culture which characterise various groups  of people in New Guinea. Something has been done in this direction,  but much more has yet to be learnt.    So far I have not referred to a Negrito element in the Ethnology of  New Guinea. From time to time we have heard rumours of pygmy people,  and German travellers have recorded very short individuals in Kaiser  Wilhelm's Land; but it was not till the expedition to Netherlands New  Guinea of the British Ornithological Union of 1910-11 that a definite  pygmy race was demonstrated. I think this can be no longer denied,  and the observations made by German ethnologists show that the race in  a more or less modified state is widely spread. Now Mr. Williamson,  whose work in New Guinea was contemporaneous with that of the  Netherlands New Guinea expedition, adduces evidence that this is  also the case in British territory. It is worth recalling that de  Quatrefages and Hamy (_Crania Ethnica_, 1882, pp. 207-210, 253-256)  distinguish a \"Negrito-Papuan\" and a \"Papuan\" element in the Torres  Straits. This problem will be discussed in Vol. I. of the Reports of  the Cambridge Expedition to Torres Straits. I feel little doubt that  Mr. Williamson has shown strong evidence that the Mafulu and probably  other adjacent mountain tribes are essentially a pygmy--that is to say  a Negrito--people who have been modified to some extent by Papuan and  possibly Papuo-Melanesian influence, both physical and cultural. He  has marshalled his data with great skill, and has dissected out, as it  were, the physical and cultural elements of the Negrito substratum. It  only remains for other observers to study Negritos in other parts of  New Guinea to see how far these claims can be substantiated. It is  evident therefore that, apart from the valuable detailed information  which Mr. Williamson has given us concerning a hitherto unknown tribe,  he has opened up a problem of considerable interest and magnitude.    A.C. Haddon.                  THE MAFULU MOUNTAIN PEOPLE OF BRITISH NEW GUINEA            CHAPTER I    Introductory      The map appended to this volume is (with the exception of the red  lines and red lettering upon it) a reproduction of a portion of the map  relating to the explorations and surveys of Dr. Strong, Mr. Monckton  and Captain Barton, which was published in the _Geographical Journal_  for September, 1908, and the use of which has been kindly permitted  me by the Royal Geographical Society. I have eliminated the red route  lines which appear in the original map, so as to avoid confusion with  the red lines which I have added. The unbroken red lines and the red  lettering upon my map are copied from a map, also kindly placed at  my disposal, which has been recently prepared by Father Fillodean  of the Mission of the Sacred Heart, and these lines mark roughly  what the Fathers of the Mission believe to be the boundaries of the  several linguistic areas within the district covered by their map. It  will be observed that some of these lines are not continued so as to  surround and complete the definition of the areas which they indicate;  but this defect is unavoidable, as the Fathers' map only covered a  relatively small area, and even in that map the lines were not all  carried to its margin. It will also be noticed that, though the Fathers  introduce the two names Oru Lopiku and Boboi as being linguistically  distinct, they have not indicated the boundary line between the two  areas. Father Egedi, however, informed me that this boundary passes  along the ridge of hills south of the Ufafa river as far as Mt. Eleia,  and thence along the Ukalama river to the Kuni boundary. The Ukalama  river is not shown in the Geographical Society's map; but I may  say that it is shown in the Fathers' map as rising in Mt. Eleia,  and flowing thence in a south-easterly direction, and so joining the  St. Joseph river close to Dilava. The broken red line upon my map does  not appear in the Fathers' map, but has been added by me to indicate  what, I understand, the Fathers believe to be a continued boundary,  so far as ascertained, of the Fuyuge linguistic area, called by them  the Mafulu area, to which I am about to draw attention.    The term Mafulu is the Kuni pronunciation of Mambule, which is the  name, as used by themselves, of the people who live in a group of  villages within and near the north-westerly corner of the area of the  Fuyuge-speaking people, whose Papuan language, so far as ascertained,  appears, subject to local dialectal differences, to be the same, and  may, I was informed, be regarded as one common language throughout  the Fuyuge area.    The Fathers of the Mission have adopted the name Mafulu in a wider  sense, as including all the people with whom they have come in  contact of the Fuyuge-speaking area; and, though my investigations,  which form the subject-matter of this book, have been conducted only  in the neighbourhood of Mafulu itself, I was assured that, so far as  the Fathers have been able to ascertain, all these Fuyuge people not  only have similar languages, but also are substantially similar in  physique and in culture. My observations concerning the Mafulu people  may therefore, if this statement is correct, be regarded as applying,  not only to the inhabitants of the portion of the north-westerly corner  of the Fuyuge area in which the Mafulu group of villages is placed,  but to those of the whole of the north-westerly portion of the area,  and generally in a greater or less degree of accuracy to those of  the northerly and north-easterly parts of the area, and possibly the  southerly ones also.    The boundaries of this Fuyuge-speaking area can hardly be regarded  as definitely ascertained; and the discrepancies, even as regards  the courses of the rivers and the positions of the mountains, which  appear in the few available maps make it difficult to deal with the  question. The area, so far as actually ascertained by the Fathers  of the Mission, roughly speaking, covers, and seems to extend also  some distance to the south or south-west of a triangle, the western  apex of which is the junction of the river Kea with the river Aduala  (a tributary of the St. Joseph), [2] whose north-eastern apex is  Mt. Albert Edward, and whose south-eastern apex is Mt. Scratchley. It  includes the valley of the Aduala river and its streams (except those  flowing into it from the north in the region of the western apex of the  triangle) within its northern boundary, and the valley of the upper  Vanapa river and its rivers and streams in the neighbourhood of its  eastern boundary; but this eastern boundary has been found to extend  also so as to include the upper valley of the river Chirima. How far  the area extends to the south or south-west of the triangle above  mentioned appears to be uncertain.    The linguistic area to the north of the Mafulu or Fuyuge people is  that of the Ambo people, who are somewhat similar in appearance to  the Mafulu, and whose language is also Papuan, and, though differing  from the Mafulu language, is, I was told, somewhat similar to it in  grammatical construction and as regards a few of its words. The area  to the west is that of the Kuni people, whose language is Melanesian,  but whose ordinary modes of life are, I was informed, more like those  of the Mafulu than are those of the Papuan-speaking Ambo. The areas  to the east and south cannot be so definitely stated, but are dealt  with below.    As regards these Ambo people I may, in view of divergences of names  which appear in maps, explain that Ambo is a contraction of Ambore,  and is the name given to the people by their Mafulu neighbours, whilst  Afoa is the name given to them by the Kuni people, and is adopted  in the Geographical Society's map. [3] As regards the Kuni people,  their name is the one adopted by themselves.    Concerning the boundaries of the Fuyuge linguistic area as above  indicated, and the people whose districts adjoin that area, I propose  here to draw attention to four names, and to refer to some observations  bearing on the subject of the probable Fuyuge boundary which are to  be found in existing literature.    The term Kovio, though primarily the name of Mt. Yule, and properly  applicable to the people living in the neighbourhood of that mountain,  is now, I think, often used to express all the mountain tribes  of the hinterland of the Mekeo and Pokau, and perhaps the Kabadi,"]]]
