There  are two sagas that deal mainly with these voyages, while in other  Icelandic sagas and annals there are a number of references to Vinland  and adjacent regions. These two sagas are the \"Saga of Eric the Red\" and  another, which, for the lack of a better name, we may call the \"Vinland  History of the Flat Island Book,\" but which might well bear the same name  as the other. This last history is composed of two disjointed accounts  found in a fine vellum manuscript known as the Flat Island Book  (Flateyjar-bok), so-called because it was long owned by a family that  lived on Flat Island in Broad Firth, on the northwestern coast of  Iceland. Bishop Brynjolf, an enthusiastic collector, got possession of  this vellum, \"the most extensive and most perfect of Icelandic  manuscripts,\" and sent it, in 1662, with other vellums, as a gift to King  Frederick III. of Denmark, where it still is one of the great treasures  of the Royal Library.    On account of the beauty of the Flat Island vellum, and the number of  sagas that it contained (when printed it made 1700 octavo pages), it  early attracted the attention of Old Norse collectors and scholars, and  hence the narrative relating to Vinland that it contained came to be  better known than the vellum called Hauk's Book, containing the \"Saga of  Eric the Red,\" and was the only account of Vinland that received any  particular attention from the scholars of the seventeenth and eighteenth  centuries The Flat Island Book narrative was also given first place in  Rafn's _Antiquitates Americanae_ (Copenhagen, 1837). This ponderous volume  contained all the original sources, but it has given rise to much  needless controversy on the Norse voyages, for many of the author's  conclusions were soon found to be untenable. He failed to winnow the  sound historical material from that which was unsubstantiated or  improbable. And so far as the original sources are concerned, it was  particularly unfortunate that he followed in the footsteps of seventeenth  and eighteenth century scholars and gave precedence to the Flat Island  Book narrative. In various important respects this saga does not agree  with the account given in the \"Saga of Eric the Red,\" which modern  scholarship has pronounced the better and more reliable version, for  reasons that we shall consider later.    The Flat Island Book consists of transcripts of various sagas made by the  Icelandic priests Jon Thordsson and Magnus Thorhallsson. Very little of  their lives is known, but there is evidence to show that the most  important portion of the copying was completed about 1380. There is,  however, no information concerning the original from which the  transcripts were made. From internal evidence, however, Dr. Storm of the  University of Christiania thinks that this original account was a late  production, possibly of the fourteenth century.[4-1] It is, moreover,  evident that this original account was quite different from the one from  which the existing \"Saga of Eric the Red\" was made, so that we have two  distinct accounts of the same set of events, both separately derived from  oral tradition, a fact which, on account of the lack of harmony in  details, has been the source of much confusion, but which nevertheless  gives strong testimony concerning the verity of the Vinland tradition in  its general outlines.    The saga which has best stood the test of modern criticism, namely the  \"Saga of Eric the Red,\" has beyond this fact the additional advantage of  having come down to us in two different vellums. The one is found in  Hauk's Book, No. 544 of the Arne-Magnaean Collection in Copenhagen, and  the other is in No. 557 of the same collection. These two narratives (in  vellums 544 and 557) tell the same story. They are so closely allied that  the translation which appears in this volume has been made from a  collation of both texts, that of Hauk's Book (544) having been more  closely followed.[5-1] The Hauk's Book text is clearly legible; No. 557  is not in such good condition.    Many facts in the life of Hauk Erlendsson, who with the assistance of two  secretaries made Hauk's Book, are known. He was in 1294 made a \"lawman\"  in Iceland, and died in Norway in 1334. There are reasons for believing  that the vellum bearing his name was written a number of years before his  death, probably during the period 1310-1320. Hauk was particularly  interested in the \"Saga of Eric the Red,\" as he was descended from  Thorfinn Karlsefni, the principal character of the saga, a fact that  perhaps lends a certain authority to this version as against that of the  Flat Island Book. Hauk brings the genealogical data of the saga down to  his own time, which is not done in No. 557, one fact among others which  shows that 557 is not a copy of 544.

Her eyelids were swollen, and it was evident  she had been weeping. During the day she had had an interview with her  uncle, in which he harshly insisted upon her yielding to his wishes,  and marrying her cousin, Curtis.    \"But, uncle,\" she objected, \"I do not love him.\"    \"Marry him, and love will come.\"    \"Never!\" she said, vehemently.    \"You speak confidently, miss,\" said Mr. Linden, with irritation.    \"Listen, Uncle John. It is not alone that I do not love him. I dislike  him--I loathe--him.\"    \"Nonsense! that is a young girl's extravagant nonsense.\"    \"No, uncle.\"    \"There can be no reason for such a foolish dislike. What can you have  against him?\"    \"It is impressed upon me, uncle, that Curtis is a bad man. There is  something false--treacherous--about him.\"    \"Pooh! child! you are more foolish than I thought. I don't say Curtis  is an angel. No man is; at least, I never met any such. But he is no  worse than the generality of men. In marrying him you will carry out  my cherished wish. Florence, I have not long to live. I shall be glad  to see you well established in life before I leave you. As the wife of  Curtis you will have a recognized position. You will go on living in  this house, and the old home will be maintained.\"    \"But why is it necessary for me to marry at all, Uncle John?\"    \"You will be sure to marry some one. Should I divide my fortune  between you and Curtis, you would become the prey of some unscrupulous  fortune hunter.\"    \"Better that than become the wife of Curtis Waring----\"    \"I see, you are incorrigible,\" said her uncle, angrily. \"Do you refuse  obedience to my wishes?\"    \"Command me in anything else, Uncle John, and I will obey,\" pleaded  Florence.    \"Indeed! You only thwart me in my cherished wish, but are willing to  obey me in unimportant matters. You forget the debt you owe me.\"    \"I forget nothing, dear uncle. I do not forget that, when I was a poor  little child, helpless and destitute, you took me in your arms, gave  me a home, and have cared for me from that time to this as only a  parent could.\"    \"You remember that, then?\"    \"Yes, uncle. I hope you will not consider me wholly ungrateful.\"    \"It only makes matters worse. You own your obligations, yet refuse to  make the only return I desire. You refuse to comfort me in the closing  days of my life by marrying your cousin.\"    \"Because that so nearly concerns my happiness that no one has a right  to ask me to sacrifice all I hold dear.\"    \"I see you are incorrigible,\" said John Linden, stormily. \"Do you know  what will be the consequences?\"    \"I am prepared for all.\"    \"Then listen! If you persist in balking me, I shall leave the entire  estate to Curtis.\"    \"Do with your money as you will, uncle. I have no claim to more than I  have received.\"    \"You are right there; but that is not all.\"    Florence fixed upon him a mute look of inquiry.    \"I will give you twenty-four hours more to come to your senses. Then,  if you persist in your ingratitude and disobedience, you must find  another home.\"    \"Oh, uncle, you do not mean that?\" exclaimed Florence, deeply moved.    \"I do mean it, and I shall not allow your tears to move me. Not  another word, for I will not hear it. Take twenty-four hours to think  over what I have said.\"    Florence bowed her head on her hands, and gave herself up to sorrowful  thoughts. But she was interrupted by the entrance of the servant, who  announced:    \"Mr. Percy de Brabazon.\"    An effeminate-looking young man, foppishly dressed, followed the  servant into the room, and made it impossible for Florence to deny  herself, as she wished to do.    \"I hope I see you well, Miss Florence,\" he simpered.    \"Thank you, Mr. de Brabazon,\" said Florence, coldly. \"I have a slight  headache.\"    \"I am awfully sorry, I am, upon my word, Miss Florence. My doctor  tells me it is only those whose bwains are vewy active that are  troubled with headaches.\"    \"Then, I presume, Mr. de Brabazon,\" said Florence, with intentional  sarcasm, \"that you never have a headache.\"    \"Weally, Miss Florence, that is vewy clevah. You will have your joke.\"    \"It was no joke, I assure you, Mr. de Brabazon.\"    \"I--I thought it might be. Didn't I see you at the opewa last  evening?\"    \"Possibly. I was there.\"    \"I often go to the opewa. It's so--so fashionable, don't you know?\"    \"Then you don't go to hear the music?\"    \"Oh, of course, but one can't always be listening to the music, don't  you know. I had a fwiend with me last evening--an Englishman--a  charming fellow, I assure you. He's the second cousin of a lord, and  yet--you'll hardly credit it--we're weally vewy intimate. He tells me,  Miss Florence, that I'm the perfect image of his cousin, Lord Fitz  Noodle.\"    \"I am not at all surprised.\"    \"Weally, you are vewy kind, Miss Florence. I thought it a great  compliment. I don't know how it is, but evewybody takes me for an  Englishman. Strange, isn't it?\"    \"I am very glad.\"    \"May I ask why, Miss Florence?\"    \"Because---- Well, perhaps I had better not explain. It seems to give  you pleasure. You would, probably, prefer to be an Englishman.\"    \"I admit that I have a great admiration for the English character.  It's a gweat pity we have no lords in America. Now, if you would only  allow me to bring my English fwiend here----    \"I don't care to make any new acquaintances. Even if I did, I prefer  my own countrymen. Don't you like America, Mr. de Brabazon?\"    \"Oh, of courth, if we only had some lords here.\"    \"We have plenty of flunkeys.\"    \"That's awfully clevah, 'pon my word.\"    \"Is it? I am afraid you are too complimentary. You are very  good-natured.\"    \"I always feel good-natured in your company, Miss Florence. I--wish I  could always be with you.\"    \"Really! Wouldn't that be a trifle monotonous?\" asked Florence,  sarcastically.    \"Not if we were married,\" said Percy, boldly breaking the ice.    \"What do you mean, Mr. de Brabazon?\"    \"I hope you will excuse me, Miss Florence--Miss Linden, I mean; but  I'm awfully in love with you, and have been ever so long--but I never  dared to tell you so. I felt so nervous, don't you know? Will you  marry me? I'll be awfully obliged if you will.\"    Mr. de Brabazon rather awkwardly slipped from his chair, and sank on  one knee before Florence.    \"Please arise, Mr. de Brabazon,\" said Florence, hurriedly. \"It is  quite out of the question--what you ask--I assure you.\"    \"Ah! I see how it is,\" said Percy, clasping his hands sadly. \"You love  another.\"    \"Not that I am aware of.\"    \"Then I may still hope?\"    \"I cannot encourage you, Mr. de Brabazon. My heart is free, but it can  never be yours.\"    \"Then,\" said Percy, gloomily, \"there is only one thing for me to do.\"    \"What is that?\"    \"I shall go to the Bwooklyn Bwidge, climb to the parapet, jump into  the water, and end my misewable life.\"    \"You had better think twice before adopting such a desperate  resolution, Mr. de Brabazon. You will meet others who will be kinder  to you than I have been----\"    \"I can never love another. My heart is broken. Farewell, cruel girl.  When you read the papers tomorrow morning, think of the unhappy Percy  de Brabazon!\"    Mr. de Brabazon folded his arms gloomily, and stalked out of the room.    \"If my position were not so sad, I should be tempted to smile,\" said  Florence. \"Mr. de Brabazon will not do this thing. His emotions are as  strong as those of a butterfly.\"    After a brief pause Florence seated herself at the table, and drew  toward her writing materials.    \"It is I whose heart should be broken!\" she murmured; \"I who am driven  from the only home I have ever known. What can have turned against me  my uncle, usually so kind and considerate? It must be that Curtis has  exerted a baneful influence upon him. I cannot leave him without one  word of farewell.\"    She took up a sheet of paper, and wrote, rapidly:        \"Dear Uncle: You have told me to leave your house, and I      obey. I cannot tell you how sad I feel, when I reflect that I      have lost your love, and must go forth among strangers--I      know not where. I was but a little girl when you gave me a      home. I have grown up in an atmosphere of love, and I have      felt very grateful to you for all you have done for me. I      have tried to conform to your wishes, and I would obey you in      all else--but I cannot marry Curtis; I think I would rather      die. Let me still live with you as I have done. I do not "]]]
