I  would offer my love to the young ladies; but it is not fit that any of  them should know you have received this letter.--If we go to Bath,  I shall send you my simple remarks upon that famous center of polite  amusement, and every other place we may chance to visit; and I flatter  myself that my dear Miss Willis will be punctual in answering the  letters of her affectionate,    LYDIA MELFORD CLIFTON, April 6.          To Dr LEWIS.    DEAR LEWIS,    I have followed your directions with some success, and might have  been upon my legs by this time, had the weather permitted me to use my  saddle-horse. I rode out upon the Downs last Tuesday, in the forenoon,  when the sky, as far as the visible horizon, was without a cloud; but  before I had gone a full mile, I was overtaken instantaneously by a  storm of rain that wet me to the skin in three minutes--whence it came  the devil knows; but it has laid me up (I suppose) for one fortnight.  It makes me sick to hear people talk of the fine air upon Clifton-downs:  How can the air be either agreeable or salutary, where the demon of  vapours descends in a perpetual drizzle? My confinement is the more  intolerable, as I am surrounded with domestic vexations. My niece has  had a dangerous fit of illness, occasioned by that cursed incident at  Gloucester, which I mentioned in my last.--She is a poor good-natured  simpleton, as soft as butter, and as easily melted--not that she's a  fool--the girl's parts are not despicable, and her education has not  been neglected; that is to say, she can write and spell, and speak  French, and play upon the harpsichord; then she dances finely, has a  good figure, and is very well inclined; but, she's deficient in spirit,  and so susceptible--and so tender forsooth!--truly, she has got a  languishing eye, and reads romances.--Then there's her brother, 'squire  Jery, a pert jackanapes, full of college-petulance and self-conceit;  proud as a German count, and as hot and hasty as a Welch mountaineer. As  for that fantastical animal, my sister Tabby, you are no stranger to her  qualifications--I vow to God, she is sometimes so intolerable, that I  almost think she's the devil incarnate come to torment me for my  sins; and yet I am conscious of no sins that ought to entail such  family-plagues upon me--why the devil should not I shake off these  torments at once? I an't married to Tabby, thank Heaven! nor did I beget  the other two: let them choose another guardian: for my part I an't in  a condition to take care of myself; much less to superintend the  conduct of giddy-headed boys and girls. You earnestly desire to know the  particulars of our adventure at Gloucester, which are briefly these, and  I hope they will go no further:--Liddy had been so long copped up in a  boarding-school, which, next to a nunnery, is the worst kind of seminary  that ever was contrived for young women, that she became as inflammable  as touch-wood; and going to a play in holiday-time,--'sdeath, I'm  ashamed to tell you! she fell in love with one of the actors--a handsome  young fellow that goes by the name of Wilson. The rascal soon perceived  the impression he had made, and managed matters so as to see her at  a house where she went to drink tea with her governess.--This was the  beginning of a correspondence, which they kept up by means of a jade  of a milliner, who made and dressed caps for the girls at the  boarding-school. When we arrived at Gloucester, Liddy came to stay at  lodgings with her aunt, and Wilson bribed the maid to deliver a letter  into her own hands; but it seems Jery had already acquired so much  credit with the maid (by what means he best knows) that she carried  the letter to him, and so the whole plot was discovered. The rash boy,  without saying a word of the matter to me, went immediately in search  of Wilson; and, I suppose, treated him with insolence enough. The  theatrical hero was too far gone in romance to brook such usage: he  replied in blank verse, and a formal challenge ensued. They agreed to  meet early next morning and decide the dispute with sword and pistol. I  heard nothing at all of the affair, till Mr Morley came to my bed-side  in the morning, and told me he was afraid my nephew was going to fight,  as he had been overheard talking very loud and vehement with Wilson  at the young man's lodgings the night before, and afterwards went  and bought powder and ball at a shop in the neighbourhood. I got up  immediately, and upon inquiry found he was just going out. I begged  Morley to knock up the mayor, that he might interpose as a magistrate,  and in the mean time I hobbled after the squire, whom I saw at a  distance walking at a great pace towards the city gate--in spite of all  my efforts, I could not come up till our two combatants had taken their  ground, and were priming their pistols. An old house luckily screened  me from their view; so that I rushed upon them at once, before I was  perceived. They were both confounded, and attempted to make their escape  different ways; but Morley coming up with constables, at that instant,  took Wilson into custody, and Jery followed him quietly to the mayor's  house. All this time I was ignorant of what had passed the preceding  day; and neither of the parties would discover a tittle of the matter.  The mayor observed that it was great presumption in Wilson, who was a  stroller, to proceed to such extremities with a gentleman of family and  fortune; and threatened to commit him on the vagrant act.--The young  fellow bustled up with great spirit, declaring he was a gentleman, and  would be treated as such; but he refused to explain himself further. The  master of the company being sent for, and examined, touching the said  Wilson, said the young man had engaged with him at Birmingham about six  months ago; but never would take his salary; that he had behaved so well  in his private character, as to acquire the respect and good-will of all  his acquaintance, and that the public owned his merit as an actor was  altogether extraordinary.--After all, I fancy, he will turn out to be a  run-away prentice from London.--The manager offered to bail him for any  sum, provided he would give his word and honour that he would keep the  peace; but the young gentleman was on his high ropes, and would by no  means lay himself under any restrictions: on the other hand, Hopeful was  equally obstinate; till at length the mayor declared, that if they  both refused to be bound over, he would immediately commit Wilson as a  vagrant to hard labour. I own I was much pleased with Jery's behaviour  on this occasion: he said, that rather than Mr Wilson should be treated  in such an ignominious manner, he would give his word and honour  to prosecute the affair no further while they remained at  Gloucester--Wilson thanked him for his generous manner of proceeding,  and was discharged. On our return to our lodgings, my nephew explained  the whole mystery; and I own I was exceedingly incensed--Liddy being  questioned on the subject, and very severely reproached by that wildcat  my sister Tabby, first swooned away, then dissolving in a flood of  tears, confessed all the particulars of the correspondence, at the same  time giving up three letters, which was all she had received from her  admirer. The last, which Jery intercepted, I send you inclosed, and when  you have read it, I dare say you won't wonder at the progress the writer  had made in the heart of a simple girl, utterly unacquainted with the  characters of mankind. Thinking it was high time to remove her from such  a dangerous connexion, I carried her off the very next day to Bristol;  but the poor creature was so frightened and fluttered, by our threats  and expostulations, that she fell sick the fourth day after our arrival  at Clifton, and continued so ill for a whole week, that her life was  despaired of. It was not till yesterday that Dr Rigge declared her out  of danger. You cannot imagine what I have suffered, partly from the  indiscretion of this poor child, but much more from the fear of  losing her entirely. This air is intolerably cold, and the place quite  solitary--I never go down to the Well without returning low-spirited;  for there I meet with half a dozen poor emaciated creatures, with  ghostly looks, in the last stage of a consumption, who have made shift  to linger through the winter like so many exotic plants languishing in a  hot-house; but in all appearance, will drop into their graves before  the sun has warmth enough to mitigate the rigour of this ungenial  spring.--If you think the Bath-water will be of any service to me, I  will go thither so soon as my niece can bear the motion of the coach.  Tell Barns I am obliged to him for his advice; but don't choose to  follow it. If Davis voluntarily offers to give up the farm, the other  shall have it; but I will not begin at this time of day to distress my  tenants, because they are unfortunate, and cannot make regular payments:  I wonder that Barns should think me capable of such oppression--As for  Higgins, the fellow is a notorious poacher, to be sure; and an impudent  rascal to set his snares in my own paddock; but, I suppose, he thought  he had some right (especially in my absence) to partake of what nature  seems to have intended for common use--you may threaten him in my name,  as much as you please, and if he repeats the offence, let me know it  before you have recourse to justice.--I know you are a great sportsman,  and oblige many of your friends: I need not tell you to make use of my  grounds; but it may be necessary to hint, that I am more afraid of my  fowling-piece than of my game. When you can spare two or three brace of  partridges, send them over by the stagecoach, and tell Gwyllim that she  forgot to pack up my flannel and wide shoes in the trunk-mail--I shall  trouble you as usual, from time to time, till at last I suppose you will  be tired of corresponding"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21614"],[0,"For the Temple: A Tale of the Fall of Jerusalem (#3)"],[1,"and kings slew those who troubled the land, and destroyed  them utterly; and Josephus does wrong to depart from their teaching.\"    \"I know not where he could have learned such notions of mercy to  his enemies, and to the enemies of the land,\" Simon said. \"He has  been to Rome, but it is not among the Romans that he will have  found that it is right to forgive those who rise up in rebellion.\"    \"Yes, he was in Rome when he was twenty-six years old,\" Solomon  said. \"He went thither to plead the cause of certain priests who  had been thrown into bonds, by Felix, and sent to Rome. It was a  perilous voyage, for his ship was wrecked in the Adriatic and, of  six hundred men who were on board, only eighty were picked  up--after floating and swimming all night--by a ship of Cyrene. He  was not long in Rome for, being introduced to Poppaea, the wife of  Caesar, he used his interest with her and obtained the release of  those for whose sake he went there.    \"No, if he gained these ideas from anyone, he learned them from one  Banus--an Ascetic, of the sect of the Essenes, who lived in the  desert with no other clothing than the bark and leaves of trees,  and no other food save that which grew wild. Josephus lived with  him, in like fashion, for three years and, doubtless, learned all  that was in his heart. Banus was a follower, they say, of that John  whom Herod put to death; and for aught I know, of that Jesus who  was crucified, two years afterwards, at Jerusalem, and in whom many  people believed, and who has many followers, to this day. I have  conversed with some of them and, from what they tell me, this Jesus  taught doctrines similar to those which Josephus practices; and  which he may have learned from Banus, without accepting the  doctrines which the members of this sect hold, as to their founder  being the promised Messiah who was to restore Israel.\"    \"I, too, have talked with many of the sect,\" Simon said; \"and have  argued with them on the folly of their belief, seeing that their  founder by no means saved Israel, but was himself put to death.  From what I could see, there was much that was good in the  doctrines they hold; but they have exaggerated ideas, and are  opposed to all wars, even to fighting for their country. I hear  that, since there has been trouble with Rome, most of them have  departed altogether out of the land, so as to avoid the necessity  of fighting.\"    \"They are poor creatures,\" Solomon Ben Manasseh said, scornfully;  \"but we need not talk of them now, for they affect us in no way,  save that it may be that Josephus has learned somewhat of their  doctrines, from Banus; and that he is thus unduly and, as I think,  most unfortunately for the country, inclined too much to mercy,  instead of punishing the evildoers as they deserve.\"    \"But nevertheless, rabbi, it seems to me that there has been good  policy, as well, in the mercy which Josephus has shown his foes.  You know that John has many friends in Jerusalem; and that, if he  could accuse Josephus of slaughtering any, he would be able to make  so strong a party, there, that he could obtain the recall of  Josephus.\"    \"We would not let him go,\" Solomon said, hotly. \"Since the Romans  have gone, we submit to the supremacy of the council at Jerusalem,  but it is only on sufferance. For long ages we have had nothing to  do with Judah; and we are not disposed to put our necks under their  yoke, now. We submit to unity because, in the Romans, we have a  common foe; but we are not going to be tyrannized. Josephus has  shown himself a wise ruler. We are happier, under him, than we have  been for generations under the men who call themselves kings, but  who are nothing but Roman satraps; and we are not going to suffer  him to be taken from us. Only let the people of Jerusalem try that,  and they will have to deal with all the men of Galilee.\"    \"I am past the age at which men are bound to take up the sword, and  John has not yet attained it but, if there were need, we would both  go out and fight. What could they do, for the population of Galilee  is greater than that of Judah? And while we would fight, every man,  to the death; the Jews would, few of them, care to hazard their  lives only to take from us the man we desire to rule over us.  Still, Josephus does wisely, perhaps, to give no occasion for  accusation by his enemies.    \"There is no talk, is there, rabbi, of any movement on the part of  the Romans to come against us, in force?\"    \"None, so far as I have heard,\" the rabbi replied. \"King Agrippa  remains in his country, to the east; but he has no Roman force with  him sufficient to attempt any great enterprise and, so long as they  leave us alone, we are content.\"    \"They will come, sooner or later,\" Simon said, shaking his head.  \"They are busy elsewhere. When they have settled with their other  enemies, they will come here to avenge the defeat of Cestius, to  restore Florus, and to reconquer the land. Where Rome has once laid  her paw, she never lets slip her prey.\"    \"Well, we can fight,\" Solomon Ben Manasseh said, sternly. \"Our  forefathers won the land with the sword, and we can hold it by the  sword.\"    \"Yes,\" Martha said quietly, joining in the conversation for the  first time, \"if God fights for us, as He fought for our  forefathers.\"    \"Why should He not?\" the rabbi asked sternly. \"We are still his  people. We are faithful to his law.\"    \"But God has, many times in the past, suffered us to fall into the  hands of our enemies as a punishment for our sins,\" Martha said,  quietly. \"The tribes were carried away into captivity, and are  scattered we know not where. The temple was destroyed, and the  people of Judah dwelt long as captives in Babylon. He suffered us  to fall under the yoke of the Romans.    \"In his right time, He will fight for us again; but can we say that  that time has come, rabbi, and that He will smite the Romans, as He  smote the host of Sennacherib?\"    \"That no man can say,\" the rabbi answered, gloomily. \"Time only  will show but, whether or no, the people will fight valiantly.\"    \"I doubt not that they will fight,\" Simon said; \"but many other  nations, to whom we are but as a handful, have fought bravely, but  have succumbed to the might of Rome. It is said that Josephus, and  many of the wisest in Jerusalem, were heartily opposed to the  tumults against the Romans, and that they only went with the people  because they were in fear of their lives; and even at Tiberias many  men of worth and gravity, such as Julius Capellus, Herod the son of  Miarus, Herod the son of Gamalus, Compsus, and others, are all  strongly opposed to hostility against the Romans.    \"And it is the same, elsewhere. Those who know best what is the  might and power of Rome would fain remain friendly with her. It is  the ignorant and violent classes have led us into this strait; from  which, as I fear, naught but ruin can arise.\"    \"I thought better things of you, Simon,\" the rabbi said, angrily.    \"But you yourself have told me,\" Simon urged, \"that you thought it  a mad undertaking to provoke the vengeance of Rome.\"    \"I thought so, at first,\" Solomon admitted, \"but now our hand is  placed on the plow, we must not draw back; and I believe that the  God of our fathers will show his might before the heathen.\"    \"I trust that it may be so,\" Simon said, gravely. \"In His hand is  all power. Whether He will see fit to put it forth, now, in our  behalf remains to be seen. However, for the present we need not  concern ourselves greatly with the Romans. It may be long before  they bring an army against us; while these seditions, here, are at  our very door, and ever threaten to involve us in civil war.\"    \"We need fear no civil war,\" the rabbi said. \"The people of all  Galilee, save the violent and ill disposed in a few of the towns,  are all for Josephus. If it comes to force, John and his party know  that they will be swept away, like a straw before the wind. The  fear is that they may succeed in murdering Josephus; either by the  knife of an assassin, or in one of these tumults. They would rather  the latter, because they would then say that the people had torn  him to pieces, in their fury at his misdoings.    \"However, we watch over him, as much as we can; and his friends  have warned him that he must be careful, not only for his own sake,  but for that of all the people; and he has promised that, as far as  he can, he will be on his guard against these traitors.\"    \"The governor should have a strong bodyguard,\" John exclaimed,  impetuously, \"as the Roman governors had. In another year, I shall  be of age to have my name inscribed in the list of fighting men;  and I would gladly be one of his guard.\"    \"You are neither old enough to fight, nor to express an opinion  unasked,\" Simon said, \"in the presence of your elders.\"    \"Do not check the boy,\" the rabbi said. \"He has fire and spirit;  and the days are coming when we shall not ask how old, or how  young, are those who would fight, so that they can but hold arms.    \"Josephus is wise not to have a military guard, John, because the  people love not such appearance of state. His enemies would use  this as an argument that he was setting himself up above them. It  is partly because he behaves himself discreetly, and goes about  among them like a private person, of no more account than  themselves, that they love him. None can say he is a tyrant,  because he has no means of tyrannizing. His enemies cannot urge it  against him at Jerusalem--as they would doubtless do, if they  could--that he is seeking to lead Galilee away from the rule of  Jerusalem, and to set himself up as its master for, to do this, he  would require to gather an army; and Josephus has not a single  armed man at his service, save and except that when he appears to  be in danger many, out of love of him, assemble and provide him  escort.    \"No, Josephus is wise in that he affects neither pomp"]]]
