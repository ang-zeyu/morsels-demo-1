By means of the syringe it can leap through the water faster than it can  move by its slow-going legs.    Mollie wants to know if we can see the syringe.    No, it is inside the body.    But there is a kind of dragon fly that has a pair of gills outside, at  the end of the abdomen, instead of the syringe inside.    The best I can do is to show you a picture of one. Some day we may find  it in the pond.    [Illustration]    Those two feather-like parts at the tail end are gills.    Yes, John, it can propel itself through the water by rowing, as it were,  with these gills.    There are some species of dragon fly larvae that swim by moving the tip  of the abdomen from side to side, as a fish moves its body when it  swims.    But now let us return to our funny larva that lives at the bottom of the  pond. It stays down there, eating and growing and moulting, for nine or  ten months or even longer; then something very wonderful happens.    It suddenly feels a great desire to get up to the top of the pond.    [Illustration]    It climbs up a weed or a stick until it is clear out of the water.    Then its skin splits down the back for the last time, and out there  pulls itself, not a larva, but a weak-looking dragon fly, with soft and  flabby little wings.    Now is its hour of danger, and now is the time for such birds as like  the taste of young dragon flies to help themselves.    Catbirds seem to have a special fondness for these helpless insects, and  have been known to eat them before the flabby little wings had grown  stiff.    If the birds do not find the newly emerged dragon fly, it remains  motionless an hour or so, but it does not remain unchanged.    Its wings stretch out and harden.    Bright metallic colors begin to play over them and over its body; and  all at once--off it darts, away and away, glittering in the sunshine, a  swift, beautiful winged creature.    Towards the end of summer you will often see dragon flies darting about  in every direction.    They seem to come in swarms and I think they usually come where there  are ponds or marshes, for in such places there are many gnats and  mosquitoes.    Mollie wants to know why it would not be a good plan for people who live  where there are many mosquitoes to raise dragon flies?    That is a very sensible idea, Mollie, and it has been tried.    Yes, indeed; some men once collected dragon fly larvae, and took care of  them until they changed into dragon flies.    Then what do you think happened?    As soon as they got their wings, away went those dragon flies,--away  and away, without stopping to catch a single mosquito for the men who  had taken the trouble to raise them.    The dragon flies will not stay at home.    They fly so fast and so far there is no use raising them.    They are among the swiftest and strongest of insects.    How do the larvae get in the ponds? Frank is asking.    I will tell you what I know about it.    [Illustration]    The winged dragon flies mate, and the female then drops her eggs in the  water or lays them on twigs in the water, where they hatch out into  larvae.    The dragon flies have to be very careful when they go close to the water  to lay their eggs.    You all know why.    Yes, it is because the frogs are on the watch to catch them.    [Illustration]    The mother dragon fly knows the larvae have to live in the water, and so  she takes pains to put the eggs there; sometimes she even crawls down  under the water on stems of plants to lay her eggs. Isn't she a wise  little mother?    There are a good many species of dragon flies.    Some are large and some are small.    Some are bright and some are dull.    There are black ones and bright blue ones, or green ones with blue eyes.    Some are marked with red and yellow.    They are a very gay family.    The dragon fly family is also a very old one.    Indeed, it is one of the oldest families on earth.    Long before there were bees or butterflies or dogs or horses or human  beings, there were dragon flies.    Don't you suppose that may be why the dragon fly is such a  strange-looking insect?    It does not look like other insects; it is very old-fashioned, like the  pine trees.    Pine trees, too, belong to a very old plant family that lived long ago,  before there were oaks or maples, or other trees that shed their leaves.    Now we must go home.    Good-by, green frog, you may come back to your log now.    Good-by, pretty dragon fly people, we shall never forget you.    Good-by, pleasant pond and moss-grown log, we hope to see you often  again.    [Illustration]          THE FAIRY MAY FLIES    [Illustration]      Come, children, and see! Hundreds and hundreds of them are dancing  about.    What are they? Yes, May, they do make us think of the dragon flies, but  they are like fairy demoiselles.    They are the May flies, fairy ships sailing in the sea of air.    See how they are tossed about.    Many have fallen to the ground, which is covered with them.    They live but a day, or sometimes only a few hours, and so they are  called day flies, and also ephemerae, which means short-lived.    They have eyes, as you can see, little round eyes, but their mouth is so  tiny they cannot eat.    Strange little beings to come into the world so helpless!    How different from the strong, fierce dragon flies!    See their dainty little legs. Six, you see, and legs and wings grow out  from the thorax.    Have they an abdomen?    See the long threads at the end of it, they look like slender tails. How  they spread these threads out as they fly!    They have four wings, but the wings are not shaped like those of the  dragon fly, and they are very much more delicate.    [Illustration: DRAGON FLY WINGS.]    [Illustration: MAY FLY WINGS.]    Yes, May, I agree with you, they look like fine lace.    The fore wings, you see, are larger than the hind ones.    Richard asks, \"Where do May flies come from? and why are they called May  flies?\"    Now, Richard, one question at a time, if you please, and the last shall  come first because it is easier to answer.    They are called May flies because they often come out in the month of  May, though sometimes not until June, and some species are as late as  July in appearing.    [Illustration]    We shall have to look into the ponds and little streams to discover  where they come from.    See, John has scooped up some little speckled grubs out of the mud. Is  it possible that _they_ are the larvae of our fairy May flies? _They_  have a mouth!--see what big jaws for such little creatures.    And what do you suppose they eat?    No doubt they, too, live on animal food.    No doubt they move about in the mud and catch what they can.    You see, John had to dig them up; they like to burrow in the weeds and  mud, and some of them even make tunnels of mud in which to protect their  soft bodies. Their short, stout legs enable them to dig well.    Their bodies are soft, but their jaws are not. O dear, no!    [Illustration]    The grown-up May flies mate, and then the female drops her eggs on the  surface of the water. When she does this a fish will very often jump up  and seize her, for fish are very fond of May flies, and lucky are the  May flies to escape these ravenous enemies.    The eggs are heavy and sink to the bottom, where they hatch into these  queer-looking larvae that eat and grow and shed their skin just like the  dragon fly larvae.    Those brushes along their sides are the gills they breathe with.    See the gills moving swiftly back and forth; they look as though the  larva wished to swim with them, but this is not why it moves them so  constantly.    The continual motion of the gills stirs up the water and keeps our larva  supplied with fresh air.    Nellie is asking what gills are.    Well, gills in fishes and in such insects as have gills, and in crabs  and lobsters and other creatures that live in the water, are parts that  often look like fringes or flat plates.    The gills of fishes have a great many blood vessels running through  them. The walls of these blood vessels are very thin, and the oxygen  from the air that is in the water passes into the blood that is in the  gills, and then this blood, all full of oxygen, circulates through the  fish's body.    You see in fishes the blood vessels come into the gills and get the  oxygen.    In insects it is different. There are air tubes running like tiny pipes  all through the gills and into the body of the insect. The oxygen of the  air that is in the water passes out through the walls of these tubes  into the blood of the insect.    Yes, John, in fishes the blood comes to the air, in insects the air goes  to the blood. The air passes into the air tubes of the insects, and thus  is carried all through their bodies.    The blood takes the oxygen out of the air.    Without oxygen in the blood no animal could live.    Now let us go back to our May flies. They remain in the larval state a  year, and some species remain two years. Think of living in the mud for  two long years!    In the mud they creep about, eating, eating, eating. Then some summer  day they leave the mud and swim to the surface of the water.    Pop! they are gone.    They were so quick about it we could not see what happened.    The larval skin burst open and forth leaped the May fly, like a winged  fairy from a prison cell.    They do not come out slowly and wait for their wings to dry like the  dragon fly.    [Illustration]    They spring out all of a sudden and fly away, leaving their cast-off  skin in the pond.    Unless their motions were quick they might be snapped up by the fish  that are so fond of them.    But though they seem to emerge thus quickly into perfect winged May  flies, they are not quite done with infancy. They are still wrapped  about by a very delicate skin that they have to get rid of. So they fly  to a bush near the water and stay a little while until this"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18794"],[0,"Three Years' War (#3)"],[1,"ry, at a range of about  4,500 yards. Our gun fired a few shots in return, but was soon silenced,  and we had to remove it from its position. Small arms were our only  weapons for the remainder of the contest.    The English at once began as usual to attack our flanks, but they did  not attempt to get round our wings. Their object appeared to be to keep  us in small parties, so that we should be unable to concentrate a large  force anywhere.    Meanwhile the troops which were making the attack pushed on closer and  closer to us. The country was of such a nature that they were able to  get quite near to us without coming under our fire, for small kloofs[9]  and other inequalities of the ground afforded them excellent cover. But  when they did show themselves they were met by such a frightful and  unceasing fire that they could not approach nearer than two hundred  paces from our lines.    The brunt of the attack was borne by the burghers from Kroonstad, who,  under Commandant Nel, formed our western wing. More to the east, where I  myself was, our men had less to endure. But every burgher, wherever he  might be, fought with the greatest courage. Although there were some who  fell killed or wounded, there was no sign of yielding throughout the  whole battle, and every one of our positions we successfully held.    Till three o'clock in the afternoon we kept up our rifle fire on the  English, and then we ceased, for the enemy, realizing the impossibility  of driving us out of our positions, withdrew to Ladysmith. Shortly  afterwards we were able to go over the battlefield. There were not many  dead or wounded to be seen; but burghers who had been stationed on the  high kop previously mentioned had seen the English remove their wounded  during the engagement.    We ourselves had eleven men killed and twenty-one wounded, of whom two  subsequently died. This loss touched us deeply, yet it was encouraging  to notice that it had not the effect of disheartening a single officer  or burgher.    Just as the battle began Mr. A.P. Cronje arrived on the scene. He had  been nominated by the President as Vechtgeneraal, and had taken over the  command from Vice-General C.J. De Villiers. He was most useful in this  engagement. When it was over I agreed with him in thinking that our  forces were too weak to pursue the retreating English troops. As soon  as I was able to leave my position it gave me great pleasure to shake  hands with him, for he was an old friend and fellow-member of the  Volksraad. It was pleasant to greet him as Vechtgeneraal--he was the son  of a valiant officer who had fought in the Basuto war of 1865 and 1866.  He had reached the age of sixty-six years, an age when it is very hard  for a man to have to stand the strain which the duties of a  Vechtgeneraal necessarily entail.

On  that date General Joubert joined us with a portion of the Transvaal  commandos. On his arrival it was settled that the Transvaalers should  proceed to the north of Ladysmith and occupy positions on the east of  Nicholson's Nek, whilst the Free-Staters were to go to the west and  north-west of that town.    A party of burghers, under Commandant Nel, of Kroonstad, were ordered to  station themselves on a kop with a flat top, called Swartbooiskop,[10]  an hour and a half to the south of Nicholson's Nek. After the battle  which was fought on the 30th of November this kop was christened by us  Little Majuba.    Just after sunrise on the 30th of November the roaring of cannon came to  our ears. The sound came from the extreme end of our position, where the  Transvaalers were stationed. No sooner did we hear it than the order to  off-saddle was given. I myself asked Commandant Steenekamp, who had  arrived the previous day from Bezuidenhoutspas, to go to General Croup's  laager, about two miles distant, and to request him to advance to where  the firing was taking place. To this request General Croup acceded, and  Commandant Steenekamp went there with three hundred men, of whom I was  one. Our way led past the kop to the south of Nicholson's Nek. What a  sight met our gaze on our arrival there!    The kop was occupied by the English.    This must be ascribed to the negligence of Commandant Nel, who had  orders to guard the kop. He excused himself by assuring us that he had  been under the impression that one of his Veldtcornets and a number of  burghers were occupying the hill.    What could we do now?    Commandant Steenekamp and I decided that we must storm the hill with the  three hundred men whom we had at our disposal. And this we did, and were  sufficiently fortunate to capture the northern point of the kop.    On reaching the summit we discovered that the British troops occupied  positions extending from the southern point to the middle of the  mountain.    The enemy, the moment we appeared on the ridge, opened a heavy rifle  fire upon us. We answered with as severe a fusillade as theirs. Whilst  we were shooting, twenty of Commandant Nel's men joined us and helped us  to hold our ground. When we had been engaged in this way for some time  we saw that the only possible course was to fight our way from position  to position towards the English lines.    I now observed that the mountain top was of an oblong shape, extending  from north to south for about a thousand paces. At the northern end,  where we were, the surface was smooth, but somewhat further south it  became rough and stony, affording very good cover. In our present  situation we were thus almost completely exposed to the enemy's fire.  The English, on the other hand, had excellent positions. There were a  number of ruined Kaffir kraals scattered about from the middle of the  mountain to its southern end, and these the enemy had occupied, thus  securing a great advantage.    Our bullets hailed on the English, and very shortly they retreated to  the southernmost point of the mountain. This gave us the chance for  which we had been waiting, for now we could take the splendid positions  they had left.    Whilst this was going on an amusing incident occurred. A Jew came up to  a burgher who was lying behind a stone, on a piece of ground where  boulders were scarce.    \"Sell me that stone for half-a-crown,\" whined the Jew.    \"Loop!\"[11] the Boer cried; \"I want it myself.\"    \"I will give you fifteen shillings,\" insisted the Jew.    Although the Boer had never before possessed anything that had risen in  value with such surprising rapidity, at that moment he was anything but  ready to drive a bargain with the Jew, and without any hesitation he  positively declined to do business.    In the positions from which the English had retired we found several  dead and wounded men, and succeeded in capturing some prisoners.    The enemy were now very strongly posted at the south end of the  mountain, for there were in their neighbourhood many Kaffir kraals and  huge boulders to protect them from our marksmen. Their fire on us became  still more severe and unceasing, and their bullets whistled and sang  above our heads, or flattened themselves against the stones. We gave at  least as good as we got, and this was so little to their liking that  very soon a few white flags appeared in the kraals on their left wing,  and from that quarter the firing stopped suddenly.    I immediately gave the order to cease fire and to advance towards the  enemy. All at once the English blazed away at us again. On our part, we  replied with vigour. But that did not continue long. In a very short  time white flags fluttered above every kraal--the victory was ours.    I have no wish to say that a misuse of the white flag had taken place. I  was told when the battle was over that the firing had continued, because  the men on our eastern wing had not observed what their comrades on  their left had done. And this explanation I willingly accept.    Our force in this engagement consisted only of three hundred men from  Heilbron, twenty from Kroonstad, and forty or fifty from the  Johannesburg Police, these latter under Captain Van Dam. The Police had  arrived on the battlefield during the fighting, and had behaved in a  most praiseworthy manner.    But I overestimate our numbers, for it was not the _whole_ of the  Heilbron contingent that reached the firing line. We had to leave some  of them behind with the horses at the foot of the kop, and there were  others who remained at the first safe position they reached--a frequent  occurrence at that period.    I took careful note of our numbers when the battle was over, and I can  state with certainty that there were not more than two hundred burghers  actually engaged.    Our losses amounted to four killed and five wounded. As to the losses of  the English, I myself counted two hundred and three dead and wounded,  and there may have been many whom I did not see. In regard to our  prisoners, as they marched past me four deep I counted eight hundred and  seventeen.    In addition to the prisoners we also captured two Maxim and two mountain  guns. They, however, were out of order, and had not been used by the  English. The prisoners told us that parts of their big guns had been  lost in the night, owing to a"]]]
