Anyhow, the aggrieved ones had their revenge, for the  bishop's death, which happened on the eve of St. Francis, \"after  drinking of a certain sirrop,\" was popularly attributed to the direct  intervention of the saint himself. He is buried in the Lady Chapel,  which he had transformed and decorated with such tender care, and a slab  in the centre of the pavement, bearing the legend \"Petra tegit Petrum  nihil officiat sibi tetrum,\" is dedicated to his memory.    It has been ascertained by Canon Hingeston-Randolph that Bishop Quivil  was the first to endow the office of chaunter with an adequate salary,  and that the first to enjoy the benefit of it was Walter de Lecchelade  or Lechlade, though he was by no means the first chaunter or precentor.  A dispute that long agitated antiquaries has thus been settled. For it  was contended by some that John the chaunter was the first to hold the  office, by others that Quivil founded the office and that the bishop's  name was really John Cauntor. But the explanation that the stipend was  only increased by Quivil, and that it existed before his day, was  entirely satisfactory, we may hope, to the supporters of the rival  theories. The above-mentioned Walter Lechlade was murdered \"about two in  the morning\" on his return from matins in the cathedral cloisters. The  murderers escaped through the south gate of the city, which was left  open. An extraordinary sensation was created, not in Exeter only but  throughout England. The bishop invited Edward I. and his queen to keep  their Christmas at the Palace. We are told \"they were very industrious  in finding out the murtherers.\" At last Alfred Dupont, an ex-mayor and  porter of the south gate, was found guilty and executed accordingly.  Perhaps, had the office of chaunter not been endowed, Walter Lechlade  might have continued for many long years to chaunt in sonorous voice  \"matins, vespers, obits, and the like.\" At any rate the story is worth  telling, being an interesting picture of manners in the middle ages. It  will be found given, with many interesting details, in an appendix by  Canon Hingeston-Randolph to his edition of the Register of Bishop Quivil  (p. 438).    Quivil's successor was Thomas De Bytton, Dean of Wells. Under his  guidance the work of transformation planned by his predecessor was  loyally continued, for he faithfully adhered to the original design.  Though Bytton appears to have been less active outside his diocese than  many of the Exeter bishops, his mode of life must have commended itself  to a large circle. A grant of forty days' indulgence was the reward of  all those who availed themselves of his spiritual ministrations, or  offered prayers for his prosperity during his life and after death.  Among the signatures appended to the document notifying this singular  privilege are those of numerous archbishops and bishops, among them  being those of the archbishops of Cosensa and Jerusalem, and Manfred,  Bishop of St. Mark's, Venice. \"The seal of Manfred,\" Dr. Oliver says,  \"is perfect; he stands robed, with a piece of embroidery on his alb. The  crozier is simply curved. His legend is S. MANFREDI. DEI. GRA. EPISCOP.  SCI. MARCHI.\" It was dated at Rome in the year 1300. Possibly Bytton's  great learning, by which he had risen to be Professor of Canon Law at  Oxford and Pope's Chaplain, was partly the reason of so notable a  compliment. But the noble work he was doing in the cathedral church of  his diocese, we may hope, had not a little to do with the honour. For to  him we owe the entire transformation of the choir with its aisles.  Bytton's labours were, indeed, very great. We hear of large quantities  of stone procured from Barley, and of sandstone from Salcombe and  Branscombe. He also put a good deal of stained glass into the windows;  so that in the eleventh year of his episcopate the following item is  recorded: \"Master Walter le Verrouer for setting the glass of the upper  gable and of eight upper windows, and of six windows in the aisles of  the new work, in gross, L4 l0s.\" Bytton was succeeded, in 1308, by  Walter de Stapledon, the most famous of all the bishops of Exeter. A  younger son of Sir Richard Stapledon of Annery, his appointment was the  first of a succession of aristocratic nominations. He, too, had been a  professor of canon law at Oxford, was a chaplain to the Pope and  precentor of the cathedral church of Exeter. The feast given after his  enthronement was unusually splendid, the revenues for a whole year being  spent on the festivities. It seems as though, conscious of his great  talents, he determined to signalize his accession to the episcopal  office by some event of unusual magnificence. It must be remembered that  Exeter was at this time one of the largest and richest sees in England.  As Professor Freeman has pointed out, \"The Bishop of Exeter, like the  Archbishop of York, was the spiritual head of a separate people.\"  Stapledon set about expediting the work of transforming the cathedral  into the Decorated style in vigorous fashion. The Fabric Rolls record  that he himself gave the (then) enormous sum of L1,800 towards defraying  the cost. His generosity encouraged others to subscribe liberally  towards the building fund. One of his first duties was to complete the  choir, a payment being made to William Canon of L35 2s. 8d. for \"marble  from Corfe for the columns.\" But the choir was really Bytton's, the new  bishop had only to give to it \"a few final, though not unimportant,  touches.\" Still he found plenty of work to hand that might receive the  impress of his sole initiative. He designed and completed the triforium  arcade above the choir arches, and directed the colouring of the choir  vault, the total expenses for oil and colour being estimated at L1 9s.  73/4d. By these \"final touches\" the transformation of the choir into the  Decorated style was completed. But Stapledon determined to further  enrich his already beautiful church with accessories of surpassing  splendour. He erected a high altar of silver, also the beautiful  sedilia, and though there has been a good deal of dispute about the  matter, the more trustworthy authorities attribute to him the bishop's  throne of carved wood. At any rate, in 1312, there is a charge of L6  12s. 81/2d. for \"timber for the bishop's seat.\" The altar, unfortunately,  has disappeared, but it is reputed to have cost a sum equivalent to  L7,000 of our money. Canon Freeman thus describes it: \"Above, as it  should seem (for the entries are very obscure), was a canopy of  considerable extent, wrought with bosses internally. The whole seems to  have been surmounted by a figure of our Lord.\" With Stapledon building  seems to have been a favourite recreation; for though he gave most  largely both of time and money to the cathedral work, he found  opportunity to build and endow Harts Hall, Stapledon Inn--now Exeter  College--Oxford, and the \"very fair\" Essex House in London. In 1320 he  was created Lord High Treasurer by Edward II., and later in the same  year received from his sovereign the power of holding pleas of \"hue and  cry\" in the lands, tenements, and fees of the bishopric in the county of  Cornwall. The neglected condition of many of the parish churches in his  diocese distressed him, and almost his last public appearance in the  west of England was at Lawhitton, where he spoke severely on this matter  to his Dean and Chapter, and bade them see to it that in future there  should be no good cause of complaint. In the autumn of 1324 he set out  for France, accompanying the young Prince Edward, who was about to do  homage to the French king for the duchies of Aquitaine and Poitou. But  his \"irreproachable integrity\" made him unpopular, and his life was  threatened. On his return to England he saw that a crisis was at hand,  and almost immediately after his arrival Queen Eleanor landed on the  coast of Suffolk. Edward II., in a brief moment of wisdom, assigned to  the faithful bishop the government of London and retreated to Bristol.  But it was too late to effect a reconciliation or prevent a catastrophe.  With a firm hand Stapledon endeavoured to restore order and quiet, and  promulgated a decree by which all rebels were excommunicated. But the  citizens, wisely perhaps, sided with the conquerors, and the bishop died  a martyr to duty. The story is well told in the French chronicles quoted  by Dr. Oliver. \"The Bishop of Exeter, riding towards his inn or hotel,  in Eldeanes-lane for dinner, encountered the mob, and, hearing them  shout Traitor, he rode rapidly to St. Paul's for sanctuary, but was  unhorsed, taken to Cheapside, stripped and beheaded. About the hour of  vespers, the same day, October 15th, the choir of St. Paul's took up the  headless body of the prelate and conveyed it to St. Paul's, but, on  being informed that he died under sentence, the body was brought to St.  Clement's beyond the Temple, but was ejected; so that the naked corpse,  with a rag given by the charity of a woman, was laid on the spot called  'Le Lawles Cherche,' and without any grave, lay there with those of his  two esquires, without office of priest or clerk. His house was attacked,  the gates burned, quantities of jewels and plate plundered.\"    In another account of his death it is stated that his head was \"fixed on  a long pole by way of trophy, that it might be to all beholders a  lasting memorial of his attempted crime.\" There was a personal reason  why the bishop was unpopular among the citizens, for \"he procured that  the justices in eyre should sit in London; on which occasion, because  the citizens had committed various offences, they were heavily punished  by the loss of their liberties,"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19444"],[0,"The Brochure Series of Architectural Illustration, Vol. 01, No. 06, June 1895 (#3)"],[1,"in their special  fields.    The Chicago exhibit, known as the Institute of Building Arts, located at  from 63 to 69 Washington Street, is owned and managed directly by the  Illinois Chapter of the American Institute of Architects, and has been  controlled in this way for the past five years.    It was established for the purpose of centralizing information relating  to buildings, and collecting in a permanent exhibition all materials,  appliances, or inventions of a practical or ornamental character. Its  advantages are: First, educational, by placing before the interested  public an aggregation of building intelligence in the form of exhibits  of the actual materials, appliances, and inventions employed in modern  construction. Second, that in the fact of such centralization of  materials, a vast amount of time is saved to the public concerned in  building interests. For those who desire to build, information is not  only gained regarding a large variety of improvements, but obtained in a  minimum quantity of time.    The Institute of Building Arts is free to the visiting public, who are  welcome to all its advantages of information and to the inspection of  the numerous exhibits it contains. It furnishes gratuitously, to any one  who may inquire, information relating to building improvements. It  maintains a series of tests of materials, the results of which may be  obtained by anyone asking for them. Courses of lectures given by skilful  specialists instructive in the many sciences and arts of Architecture  are given under its auspices.    The management of the Institute is strictly impartial as to the merits  of the exhibits, having no financial interest in any sale. The purchaser  has perfect liberty to examine the exhibits and negotiate with any  exhibitor. It is the duty of the management to protect each and every  display from any impositions or trespasses on their several rights, and  to explain to any inquirer the qualities and merits of the material or  invention, as claimed by the exhibitor, but to give no individual  expression of views for or against any exhibit. The examiners are to be  left perfectly free to judge and accept from their own standpoint.    The important work of the Institution has made of it a central point of  great interest to all connected with or interested in architecture and  its kindred arts, and those who are identified with the work will not  fail to be amply repaid for their interest or their labor in its  upbuilding.    It became necessary a year ago to increase the floor space, and nearly  one half as much more space was secured and the rooms are crowded with  beautiful and instructive exhibits. The Illinois Chapter, A. I. A., has  fitted up a fine library and meeting-room in the Institute, which it  throws open to the interested public, who find the many pictures and  books therein a great enjoyment and benefit.    The other exhibits above referred to are strictly commercial in  character, and conducted in the interests of the exhibitors, and  consequently may not command the prestige possessed by the Chicago  Institute. Nevertheless they are important educational factors in their  special localities and are a great convenience to all connected with the  building trades. Every large commercial centre should be thus supplied.  The success of those already established will doubtless lead to the  early establishment of others. Architects and manufacturers both need  only to observe the workings of any of the exhibits which we have  mentioned to be convinced of their great practical value, and each  individual will be enhancing his own interest while contributing to the  success of all the others concerned by lending whatever assistance he  can to this most praiseworthy enterprise.          Notes.      An architect cannot work to the best advantage without the best and most  convenient appliances. It is true that sometimes the cleverest and most  skilful draughtsmen appear least concerned about their instruments and  materials, and often produce work showing wonderful dexterity and  mastery of technique with the most imperfect working materials. But this  is exceptional. After years of study and practice one may be able to  produce with the sharpened end of a match, or with a toothpick, drawings  which it would tax the skill of an ordinary draughtsman to approach with  the best brushes and colors, but it is easy to see that this is no  argument why the latest and most improved methods should not be  employed.    [Illustration]    Most architects still hold to the old-fashioned drawing boards supported  upon trestles, and mostly from the simple inertia of custom. The  improved Morse Universal Drawing Table, which is made in all sizes, with  a single or double support, is conceded to be more convenient and  ship-shape in all respects than the ordinary drawing board, and is only  slightly more expensive in its first cost. The size which is shown in  the accompanying illustration which has a board 30x36 inches, costs only  $15 and is by far the cheapest and best device of its kind that we have  seen. All of these tables are made to fold so as to occupy as little  space as possible when not in use; will revolve or incline at any angle,  and independently of the attachments below. They are built of the best  materials (iron, brass, and wood) and are finely finished. The board can  be made of either polished chestnut or unfinished pine if desired, and  various additional attachments can be had for further convenience.    Architects and draughtsmen will be surprised to find what a saving can  be made in time and trouble by the use of this most essential article of  furniture, as well as the remarkably low price at which it can be  bought.    Many other articles of furniture which are necessary for the proper  equipment of an architect's office are also manufactured by the Morse  Machine Company of Rochester, such as cabinets of various descriptions,  desks, special drawing boards with a steel edge (a _sine qua non_ for  the production of fine, accurate drawings), and special furniture of all  descriptions. Architects will find it greatly to their profit, both in  money and saving of trouble, to take advantage of the experience and  facilities for manufacturing the best goods furnished by this company.    There are very few manufacturers of sanitary goods that keep up with the  Dalton-Ingersoll Company in genuine improvements and novelties. Scarcely  a month passes without something in the way of improvement emanating  from this house; and the remarkable thing is the care and attention  bestowed upon the minutest details, nothing about a sanitary fixture  being considered too insignificant to command their best inventive  genius. Their monthly announcement preceding our frontispiece is worth  watching.    The palatial Jefferson Hotel at Richmond, Va., of which Carrere &  Hastings are the architects, is built of a very fine _white clay_ brick  manufactured by the Powhatan Clay Manufacturing Company of Richmond. The  strong point of this particular brick is that it is made of a natural  white clay, and is not subject to the discoloration of some bricks made  by artificially whitening the clay.    The great success of the \"Giant\" Metal Sash Chain made by the Smith &  Egge Manufacturing Company, has of course led to imitation and  infringement of their patented methods of manufacture. Nothing is saved  by specifying \"cheaper\" goods, for there really are no cheaper goods  than the best; and when heavy sashes are to be hung \"Giant\" metal chain  is the proper specification.    The expense of getting up a working model, bronze finish sash lock  mounted on a base, for a paper weight, and sending this free to any  architect who desires one would deter most manufacturers from taking  this method of advertising. But the Ives Lock is such \"a good thing\"  that it well repays \"pushing.\" The model works so perfectly and is so  simple and durable in construction that its introduction to architects  throughout the country, occupying a prominent place on their desks, is  securing the almost universal specification of the lock. Architects who  haven't one of these paper weights will be well repaid for asking Hobart  B. Ives & Co. of New Haven, Conn., to send them one. In this connection  let us add that this lock secured the medal and highest award at the  Columbian Exposition.          Personal.      Among the Americans who will return from abroad this summer are: Mr.  Walter H. Kilham, the holder of the Rotch Scholarship, who has now been  abroad two years; Mr. F. E. Perkins, who has been abroad three years;  and Mr. W. Atherton,--all of Boston. Messrs. D. Hale, W. W. Knowles,  G. O. Totten, Laflin, and Ramond, of New York, and Mr. A. D. Koch, of  Milwaukee, also return this summer.    Mr. J. Greenleaf Thorp announces his removal to the Constable Building,  111 Fifth Avenue, New York.    In bringing the affairs of the Architect Department of the city of  Boston to a final settlement pending its abolishment on July 1, Mr. Edw.  H. Hoyt has been acting as City Architect Wheelwright's assistant, in  place of Mr. Matthew Sullivan, now abroad, who has most acceptably  filled that position during the whole of Mr. Wheelwright's term of  office. In future the work of the city will be distributed among private  architects.    Mr. Frank E. Wallis has gone into partnership with Frank E. Freeman, and  opened an office on West Twentieth Street, New York City.    Mr. Harold Magonigle, the Rotch scholar who has now been abroad a year,  has during the last few months been doing important work in the way of  measuring and drawing Roman and Renaissance monuments in and near Rome.  Some of his later drawings will presently be published in _The  Architectural Review_.
