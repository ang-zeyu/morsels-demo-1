It sometimes  happened that the old and the new statues stood side by side in the same  temple, or in adjacent temples, and they seem then to exemplify the two  kinds of idolatry--the literal and the imaginative--the one being the  actual subject of the rites ceremonially observed, and the other being  the visible presentment of the deity, and helping the worshipper to  concentrate his prayers and aspirations. Here the art of the sculptor  had the fullest scope, and it is in such cases that he could, as  Quintilian said of Phidias, \"make some addition to the received  religion.\"    This duality was, however, the result of accident rather than the normal  arrangement, and, so long as the primitive image remained the official  object of worship, it was difficult, if not impossible, for the new and  more artistic statue to have its full religious effect. In many cases,  probably in most cases, it was actually substituted, sooner or later,  for the earlier embodiment of the deity. Sometimes the early image,  which was often of wood, may have decayed or been worn away by the  attentions lavished upon it; we hear of a statue of which the hand had  perished under the kisses of the devout. We hear also of cases in which  it had been entirely lost--for instance, the Black Demete of Phigalia,  an uncouth image with a horse's head; here, when a plague had warned the  people to replace it, the AEginetan sculptor Onatas undertook the task;  and he is said to have been vouchsafed a vision in sleep which enabled  him to reproduce exactly this unsightly idol. It would not seem that  such a commission gave much scope to his artistic powers; but it is  noteworthy that the Phigalians employed one of the most famous sculptors  of the day. Elsewhere the conditions were more favourable, and it was  possible for the artist, while conforming to the accepted type, to give  it a more correct form and more pleasing features.    Daedalus, we are told--and in this story Daedalus is an impersonation of  the art of the early sculptors in Greece--made statues of the gods so  life-like that they had to be chained to their pedestals for fear they  should run away. It is likely that this tale goes back to a genuine  tradition; for Pausanias actually saw statues with fetters attached to  them in several early shrines in Greece. The device is natural enough.  Daedalus was a magician as well as a sculptor; and if he could give his  statues eyes that they might see, and ears that they might hear, it was  an obvious inference that if he gave them legs they might run away and  desert their shrines and their worshippers.    We may very likely find also in a similar notion the explanation of a  peculiarity often found in early statues of the gods--the well-known  archaic smile. Many explanations, technical and otherwise, have been  given of this device; but none of them can get over the fact that it was  just as easy, or even easier, for a primitive sculptor to make the mouth  straight as to make it curve up at the ends, and that he often did make  it straight. When he does not do so, it is probably done with intention;  and it is quite in accordance with the conditions of early religious art  that he should make the image of a deity smile in order that the deity  himself might smile upon his worshippers; and a pleasant expression  might also, by a natural transfer of ideas, be supposed to be pleasing  to the god, and so attract him to his statue. We are told that at Chios  there was a head of Artemis set high up, which appeared morose to those  entering the temple, but when they left it seemed to have become  cheerful. This may have been originally due to some accident of placing  or lighting, but it seems to have acquired a religious significance; and  we can hardly deny a similar significance to the smile which we find on  so many early statues. In some cases, especially in statues of men, it  may have been intended merely as a device to give expression and life to  the face; but it cannot have been a matter of indifference to a  primitive worshipper that his deity should smile on him through the face  of its visible image. This point of view being given, it is evidently  only a question of how far it is within the power of art to express the  benignity of the god, and later on his character and personality, in an  adequate manner; and this power depends on the gradual acquisition of  mastery over form and material, of knowledge and observation of the  human body and face, and of the technical skill requisite to express  this knowledge in marble or bronze, or more precious materials such as  gold and ivory. All this development belongs to the history of art, not  to that of religion. But before we can pursue the investigation any  further, it is necessary to consider the different sources and channels  of religious influence on art with which we have to deal.          CHAPTER II    VARIOUS ASPECTS OF RELIGION      Religion, for our present purpose, may be considered as (1) popular, (2)  official, (3) poetic, and (4) philosophical. These four divisions, or  rather aspects, are not, of course, mutually exclusive, and they act and  react extensively upon one another; but, in their relations to art, it  is convenient to observe the distinction between them.    (1) The beliefs of the people are, of course, the basis of all the  others, though they come to be affected by these others in various  degrees. There is no doubt that the people generally believed in the  sanctity and efficacy of the shapeless idols or primitive images, and  this belief would tend to support hieratic conservatism, and thus to  hinder artistic progress. But, on the other hand, the people of Greece  showed throughout their history a tendency to an intensely and vividly  anthropomorphic imagination. This tendency was doubtless realised and  encouraged by the poets, but it was not created by them, any more than  by the mythologists who defined and systematised it. The exact relation  of this anthropomorphic imagination to the primitive sacred stocks and  stones is not easy to ascertain; but it seems to have tended, on the one  hand, to the realisation of the existence of the gods apart from such  sacred objects, and thus to reduce the stocks and stones to the position  of symbols--a great advance in religious ideals; and, on the other hand,  to the transformation of the stocks and stones into human form, not  merely by giving them ears and eyes that they might hear and see, but  also by making them take the image and character of the deity whom they  represented.    It was impossible for any ordinary Greek to think of the gods in other  than human form. He had, indeed, no such definite dogma as the Hebrew  statement that \"God created man in His own image\"; for the legends about  the origin of the human race varied considerably and many of them  represented crude philosophical theorising rather than religious belief.  But the monstrous forms which we find in Egypt and Mesopotamia as  embodiments of divine power were alien to the Greek imagination; if we  find here and there a survival of some strange type, such as the  horse-headed Demeter at Phigalia, it remains isolated and has little  influence upon prevalent beliefs. The Greek certainly thought of his  gods as having the same human form as himself; and not the gods only,  but also the semi-divine, semi-human, sometimes less than human beings  with which his imagination peopled the woods and mountains and seas. His  Nereids had human feet, not fishy tails like our mermaids; and if  centaurs and satyrs and some other creatures of his imagination showed  something of the beast within the man in their visible shape, they had  little about them of the mysterious or the unearthly. It would be a  great mistake to regard all these creatures as mere impersonations or  abstractions. If \"a pagan suckled in a creed outworn\" could      \"Have sight of Proteus coming from the sea     And hear old Triton blow his wreathed horn,\"    much more were such sights and sounds familiar to his forefathers, to  whom the same beliefs were fresh and real. Even to the present day Greek  peasants may often be found who can tell of such experiences; to them,  as to the Greeks of old, desert places and remote woods and mountains  are terrible, not because they are lonely, but because when a man is  alone then is he least alone; hence the panic terror, the terror of Pan.    The same idea, which later takes the religious or philosophic form of  the belief in the omnipresence of the deity, peopled the woods with  dryads, the streams and springs with nymphs and river-gods, the seas  with Nereids and Tritons. When an artist represented a mountain or a  river-god, a nymph or a Triton, or added such figures to a scene to  indicate its locality by what seems to us at first sight a mere artistic  convention, he was not inventing an impersonation, but he was  representing something which, in the imagination of the people, might  actually be seen upon the spot--at least, by those whose eyes were  opened to see it. It was the same gift of imagination that made Blake  say: \"'What,' it will be questioned, 'when the sun rises, do you not see  a disc of fire, somewhat like a guinea?' 'Oh no, no! I see an  innumerable company of the heavenly host, crying \"Holy, holy, holy is  the Lord God Almighty!\" I question not my corporeal eye, any more than I  would question a window, concerning a sight. I look through it, and not  with it.'\"[1]    [Footnote 1: Blake, \"Aldine\" edition, p. cvi.]    In the case of the gods, the matter is somewhat less simple than in that  of all these daemonic creatures of the popular imagination. Gods imply a  greater power of generalisation and a higher stage of religious  development. It was not thought likely that the gods would show  themselves to mortal eyes, as had been their habit in the "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20532"],[0,"Love Among the Chickens (#3)"],[1,"hilling. But now, about  business. Lucky to find you in, because I've got a scheme for you,  Garny, old boy. Yes, sir, the idea of a thousand years. Now listen to  me for a moment.\"    He sat down on the table and dragged a chair up as a leg rest. Then he  took off his pince-nez, wiped them, readjusted the wire behind his  ears, and, having hit a brown patch on the knee of his gray flannel  trousers several times in the apparent hope of removing it, began to  speak.    \"About fowls,\" he said.    \"What about them?\" asked Garnet. The subject was beginning to interest  him. It showed a curious tendency to creep into the conversation.    \"I want you to give me your undivided attention for a moment,\" said  Ukridge. \"I was saying to my wife only the other day: 'Garnet's the  man. Clever man, Garnet. Full of ideas.' Didn't I, Millie?\"    \"Yes, dear,\" said Mrs. Ukridge, smiling.    \"Well?\" said Garnet.    \"The fact is,\" said Ukridge, with a Micawber-like burst of candor, \"we  are going to keep fowls.\"    He stopped and looked at Garnet in order to see the effect of the  information. Garnet bore it with fortitude.    \"Yes?\" he said.    Ukridge shifted himself farther on to the table and upset the inkpot.    \"Never mind,\" he said, \"it'll soak in. Don't you worry about that, you  keep listening to me. When I said we meant to keep fowls, I didn't  mean in a small sort of way--two cocks and a couple of hens and a  ping-pong ball for a nest egg. We are going to do it on a large scale.  We are going to keep,\" he concluded impressively, \"a chicken farm!\"    \"A chicken farm,\" echoed Mrs. Ukridge with an affectionate and  admiring glance at her husband.    \"Ah,\" said Garnet, who felt his responsibilities as chorus.    \"I've thought it all out,\" continued Ukridge, \"and it's as clear as  mud. No expenses, large profits, quick returns. Chickens, eggs, and no  work. By Jove, old man, it's the idea of a lifetime. Just listen to me  for a moment. You buy your hen--\"    \"One hen?\" inquired Garnet.    \"Call it one for the sake of argument. It makes my calculations  clearer. Very well, then. You buy your hen. It lays an egg every day  of the week. You sell the eggs--say--six for fivepence. Keep of hen  costs nothing. Profit at least fourpence, three farthings on every  half-dozen eggs. What do you think of that, Bartholomew?\"    Garnet admitted that it sounded like an attractive scheme, but  expressed a wish to overhaul the figures in case of error.    \"Error!\" shouted Ukridge, pounding the table with such energy that it  groaned beneath him. \"Error? Not a bit of it. Can't you follow a  simple calculation like that? The thing is, you see, you get your  original hen for next to nothing. That's to say, on tick. Anybody will  let you have a hen on tick. Now listen to me for a moment. You let  your hen set, and hatch chickens. Suppose you have a dozen hens. Very  well, then. When each of the dozen has a dozen chickens, you send the  old hens back with thanks for the kind loan, and there you are,  starting business with a hundred and forty-four free chickens to your  name. And after a bit, when the chickens grow up and begin to lay, all  you have to do is to sit back in your chair and gather in the big  checks. Isn't that so, Millie?\"    \"Yes, dear,\" said Mrs. Ukridge with shining eyes.    \"We've fixed it all up. Do you know Lyme Regis, in Dorsetshire? On the  borders of Devon. Quiet little fishing village. Bathing. Sea air.  Splendid scenery. Just the place for a chicken farm. I've been looking  after that. A friend of my wife's has lent us a jolly old house with  large grounds. All we've got to do is to get in the fowls. That's all  right. I've ordered the first lot. We shall find them waiting for us  when we arrive.\"    \"Well,\" said Garnet, \"I'm sure I wish you luck. Mind you let me know  how you get on.\"    \"Let you know!\" roared Ukridge. \"Why, old horse, you've got to come,  too. We shall take no refusal. Shall we, Millie?\"    \"No, dear,\" murmured Mrs. Ukridge.    \"Of course not,\" said Ukridge. \"No refusal of any sort. Pack up  to-night, and meet us at Waterloo to-morrow.\"    \"It's awfully good of you--\" began Garnet a little blankly.    \"Not a bit of it, not a bit of it. This is pure business. I was saying  to my wife when we came in that you were the very man for us. 'If old  Garnet's in town,' I said, 'we'll have him. A man with his flow of  ideas will be invaluable on a chicken farm.' Didn't I, Millie?\"    Mrs. Ukridge murmured the response.    \"You see, I'm one of these practical men. I go straight ahead,  following my nose. What you want in a business of this sort is a touch  of the dreamer to help out the practical mind. We look to you for  suggestions, Montmorency. Timely suggestions with respect to the  comfort and upbringing of the fowls. And you can work. I've seen you.  Of course you take your share of the profits. That's understood. Yes,  yes, I must insist. Strict business between friends. We must arrange  it all when we get down there. My wife is the secretary of the firm.  She has been writing letters to people, asking for fowls. So you see  it's a thoroughly organized concern. There's money in it, old horse.  Don't you forget that.\"    \"We should be so disappointed if you did not come,\" said Mrs. Ukridge,  lifting her childlike eyes to Garnet's face.    Garnet stood against the mantelpiece and pondered. In after years he  recognized that that moment marked an epoch in his life. If he had  refused the invitation, he would not have--but, to quote the old  novelists, we anticipate. At any rate, he would have missed a  remarkable experience. It is not given to everyone to see Mr. Stanley  Ukridge manage a chicken farm.    \"The fact is,\" he said at last, \"I was thinking of going somewhere  where I could get some golf.\"    Ukridge leaped on the table triumphantly.    \"Lyme Regis is just the place for you, then. Perfect hotbed of golf.  Fine links at the top of the hill, not half a mile from the farm.  Bring your clubs. You'll be able to have a round or two in the  afternoons. Get through serious work by lunch time.\"    \"You know,\" said Garnet, \"I am absolutely inexperienced as regards  fowls.\"    \"Excellent!\" said Ukridge. \"Then you're just the man. You will bring  to the work a mind entirely unclouded by theories. You will act solely  by the light of your intelligence.\"    \"Er--yes,\" said Garnet.    \"I wouldn't have a professional chicken farmer about the place if he  paid to come. Natural intelligence is what we want. Then we can rely  on you?\"    \"Very well,\" said Garnet slowly. \"It's very kind of you to ask me.\"    \"It's business, Cuthbert, business. Very well, then. We shall catch  the eleven-twenty at Waterloo. Don't miss it. You book to Axminster.  Look out for me on the platform. If I see you first, I'll shout.\"    Garnet felt that that promise rang true.    \"Then good-by for the present. Millie, we must be off. Till to-morrow,  Garnet.\"    \"Good-by, Mr. Garnet,\" said Mrs. Ukridge.    Looking back at the affair after the lapse of years, Garnet was  accustomed to come to the conclusion that she was the one pathetic  figure in the farce. Under what circumstances she had married Ukridge  he did not learn till later. He was also uncertain whether at any  moment in her career she regretted it. But it was certainly pathetic  to witness her growing bewilderment during the weeks that followed, as  the working of Ukridge's giant mind was unfolded to her little by  little. Life, as Ukridge understood the word, must have struck her as  a shade too full of incident to be really comfortable. Garnet was wont  to console himself by the hope that her very genuine love for her  husband, and his equally genuine love for her, was sufficient to  smooth out the rough places of life.    As he returned to his room, after showing his visitors to the door,  the young man upstairs, who had apparently just finished breakfast,  burst once more into song:        \"We'll never come back no more, boys,        We'll never come back no more.\"    Garnet could hear him wedding appropriate dance to the music.    \"Not for a few weeks, at any rate,\" he said to himself, as he started  his packing at the point where he had left off.          A GIRL WITH BROWN HAIR    III      Waterloo station is one of the things which no fellow can understand.  Thousands come to it, thousands go from it. Porters grow gray-headed  beneath its roof. Buns, once fresh and tender, become hard and  misanthropic in its refreshment rooms, and look as if they had seen  the littleness of existence and were disillusioned. But there the  station stands, year after year, wrapped in a discreet gloom, always  the same, always baffling and inscrutable. Not even the porters  understand it. \"I couldn't say, sir,\" is the civil but unsatisfying  reply with which research is met. Now and then one, more gifted than  his colleagues, will inform the traveler that his train starts from  \"No. 3 or No. 7,\" but a moment's reflection and he hedges with No. 12.    Waterloo is the home of imperfect knowledge. The booking clerks cannot  state in a few words where tickets may be bought for any station. They  are only certain that they themselves cannot sell them.           *       *       *       *       *    The gloom of the station was lightened on the following morning at ten  minutes to eleven when Mr. Garnet arrived to catch the train to  Axminster, by several gleams of sunshine and a great deal of bustle  and movement on the various platforms. A cheery activity pervaded the  place. Porters on every hand were giving their celebrated imitations  of the car of Juggernaut, throwing as a sop to the wounded a crisp \"by  your leave.\" Agitated ladies were pouring forth questions with the  rapidity of machine guns. Long queues surged at the mouths of the  booking offices, inside which soured clerks, sending lost sheep empty  away, were learning once more their lesson of the innate folly of  mankind. Other"]]]
