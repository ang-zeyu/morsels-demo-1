They were stopping each person who got off the starship,  asking for identity papers. Bart realized he was seeing another segment  of the same drama he had overheard discussed, and wished he knew what it  was all about.    The crowd was thinning now. Robotcabs were swerving in, hovering above  the ground to pick up passengers, then veering away. The gap in the  starship's side was closing, and still Bart had not seen the tall, slim,  flame-haired figure of his father. The port on the other side of the  ship, he knew, was for loading passengers. Bart moved carefully through  the thinning crowd, almost to the foot of the stairs. One of the Lhari  checking papers stopped and fixed him with an inscrutable gray stare,  but finally turned away again.    Bart began really to worry. Captain Steele would never miss his ship!  But he saw only one disembarking passenger who had not yet been  surrounded by a group of welcoming relatives, or summoned a robotcab and  gone. The man was wearing Vegan clothes, but he wasn't Bart's father. He  was a fat little man, with ruddy cheeks and a fringe of curling gray  hair all around his bald dome. _Maybe he'd know if there was another  Vegan on the ship._    Then Bart realized that the little fat man was staring straight at him.  He returned the man's smile, rather hesitantly; then blinked, for the  fat man was coming straight toward him.    \"Hello, Son,\" the fat man said loudly. Then, as two of the Lhari started  toward him, the strange man did an incredible thing. He reached out his  two hands and grabbed Bart.    \"Well, boy, you've sure grown,\" he said, in a loud, cheerful voice, \"but  you're not too grown-up to give your old Dad a good hug, are you?\" He  pulled Bart roughly into his arms. Bart started to pull away and stammer  that the fat man had made a mistake, but the pudgy hand gripped his  wrist with unexpected strength.    \"Bart, listen to me,\" the stranger whispered, in a harsh fast voice. \"Go  along with this or we're both dead. See those two Lhari watching us?  Call me Dad, good and loud, if you want to live. Because, believe me,  your life's in danger--right now!\"          CHAPTER TWO      For a moment, pulled off balance in the fat stranger's hug, Bart  remained perfectly still, while the man repeated in that loud, jovial  voice, \"How you've grown!\" He let him go, stepping away a pace or two,  and whispered urgently, \"Say something. And take that stupid look off  your face.\"    As he stepped back, Bart saw his eyes. In the chubby, good-natured red  face, the stranger's eyes were half-mad with fear.    In a split second, Bart remembered the two Lhari and their talk of a  fugitive. In that moment, Bart Steele grew up.    He stepped toward the man and took him quickly by the shoulders.    \"Dad, you sure surprised me,\" he said, trying to keep his voice from  shaking. \"Been such a long time, I'd--half forgotten what you looked  like. Have a good trip?\"    \"About like always.\" The fat man was breathing hard, but his voice  sounded firm and cheerful. \"Can't compare with a trip on the old  _Asterion_ though.\" The _Asterion_ was the flagship of Vega Interplanet,  Rupert Steele's own ship. \"How's everything?\"    Beads of sweat were standing out on the man's ruddy forehead, and his  grip on Bart's wrist was so hard it hurt. Bart, grasping at random for  something to say, gabbled, \"Too bad you couldn't get to my graduation. I  made th-third in a class of four hundred--\"    The Lhari had surrounded them and were closing in.    The fat man took a deep breath or two, said, \"Just a minute, Son,\" and  turned around. \"You want something?\"    The tallest of the Lhari--the old one, whom Bart had seen on the  escalator--looked long and hard at him. When they spoke Universal, their  voices were sibilant, but not nearly so inhuman.    \"Could we trrrouble you to sssshow us your paperrrssss?\"    \"Certainly.\" Nonchalantly, the fat man dug them out and handed them  over. Bart saw his father's name printed across the top.    The Lhari gestured to a Mentorian interpreter: \"What colorrr isss thisss  man's hairrr?\"    The Mentorian said in the Lhari language, \"His hair is _gray_.\" He used  the Universal word; there were, of course, no words for colors in the  Lhari speech.    \"The man we sssseek has hair of _red_,\" said the Lhari. \"And he isss  tall, not fat.\"    \"The boy is tall and with _red_ hair,\" the Mentorian volunteered, and  the old Lhari made a gesture of disdain.    \"This boy is twenty years younger than the man whose description came to  us. Why did they not give us a picture or at least a name?\" He turned to  the other Lhari and said in their own shrill speech, \"I suspected this  man because he was alone. And I had seen this boy on the upper mezzanine  and spoken with him. We watched him, knowing sooner or later the father  would seek him. Ask him.\" He gestured and the Mentorian said, \"Who is  this man, you?\"    Bart gulped. For the first time he noted the energon-ray shockers at the  belts of the four Lhari. He'd heard about those. They could stun--or  they could kill, and quite horribly. He said, \"This is my father. You  want my cards, too?\" He hauled out his identity papers. \"My name's Bart  Steele.\"    The Lhari, with a gesture of disgust, handed them back. \"Go, then,  father and son,\" he said, not unkindly.    \"Let's get going, Son,\" said the little bald man. His hand shook on  Bart's, and Bart thought, _If we're lucky, we can get out of the port  before he faints dead away._ He said \"I'll get a copter,\" and then,  feeling sorry for the stranger, gave him his arm to lean on. He didn't  know whether he was worried or scared. _Where was his father?_ Why did  this man have his dad's papers? Was his father hiding inside the Lhari  ship? He wanted to run, to burst away from the imposter, but the guy was  shaking so hard Bart couldn't just leave him standing there. If the  Lhari got him, he was a dead duck.    A copter swooped down, the pilot signaling. The little man said  hoarsely, \"No. Robotcab.\"    Bart waved the copter away, getting a dirty look from the pilot, and  punched a button at the stand for one of the unmanned robotcabs. It  swung down, hovered motionless. Bart boosted the fat man in. Inside, the  man collapsed on the seat, leaning back, puffing, his hand pressed hard  to his chest.    \"Punch a combo for Denver,\" he said hoarsely.    Bart obeyed, automatically. Then he turned on the man.    \"It's your game, mister! Now tell me what's going on? _Where's my  father?_\"    The man's eyes were half-shut. He said, gasping, \"Don't ask me any  questions for a minute.\" He thumbed a tablet into his mouth, and  presently his breathing quieted.    \"We're safe--for the minute. Those Lhari would have cut us down.\"    \"You, maybe. I haven't done anything. Look, you,\" Bart said in sudden  rage, \"you owe me some explanations. For all I know, you're a criminal  and the Lhari have every right to chase you! Why have you got my  father's papers? Did you steal them to get away from the Lhari? _Where's  my father?_\"    \"It's your father they were looking for, you young fool,\" said the man,  gasping hard. \"Lucky they had only a description and not a name--but  they've probably got that by now, uncoded. We've only confused them for  a little while. But if you hadn't played along, they'd have had you  watched, and when they get hold of the name Steele--they will, sooner or  later, the people in the Procyon system--\"    _\"Where is my father?\"_    \"I hope I don't know,\" the fat man said. \"If he's still where I left  him, he's dead. My name is Briscoe. Edmund Briscoe. Your father saved my  life years ago, never mind how. The less you know, the safer you'll be  for a while. His major worry just now is about you. He was afraid, if he  didn't turn up here, you'd take the first ship back to Vega. So he gave  me his papers and sent me to warn you--\"    Bart shook his head. \"It all sounds phony as can be. How do I know  whether to believe you or not?\" His hand hovered over the robotcab  controls. \"We're going straight to the police. If you're okay, they  won't turn you over to the Lhari. If you're not--\"    \"You young fool,\" said the fat man, with feeble violence, \"there's no  _time_ for all that! Ask me questions--I can prove I know your father!\"    \"What was my mother's name?\"    \"Oh, God,\" Briscoe said, \"I never saw her. I knew your father long  before you were born. Until he told me, I never knew he'd married or  had a son. I'd never have known you, except that you're the living  image--\" He shook his head helplessly, and his breathing sounded hoarse.    \"Bart, I'm a sick man, I'm going to die. I want to do what I came here  to do, because your father saved my life once when I was young and  healthy, and gave me twenty good years before I got old and fat and  sick. Win or lose, I won't live to see you hunted down like a dog, like  my own son--\"    \"Don't talk like that,\" Bart said, a creepy feeling coming over him. \"If  you're sick, let me take you to a doctor.\"    Briscoe did not even hear. \"Wait, there is something else. Your father  said, 'Tell Bart I've gone looking for the Eighth Color. Bart will know  what I mean.'\"    \"That's crazy. I don't know--\"    He broke off, for the memory had come, full-blown:    _He was very young: five, six, seven. His mother, tall and slender and  very fair, was bending over a blueprint, pointing with a delicate finger  at something, straightening, saying in her light musical voice:_    _\"The fuel catalyst--it's a strange color, a color you never saw  anywhere. Can you_ think _of a color that isn't red, orange, yellow,  green, blue, violet, indigo or some combination of them? It isn't any of  the colors of the spectrum at all. The fuel is a real eighth color.\"_    _And his father had used the phrase, almost adopted it. \"When we know  what the eighth color is, we'll"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2082"],[0,"Memoirs of the Comtesse Du Barry (#3)"],[1,"had been loved  by all the great names in the book of heraldry. And so she begged the  Viscount Jean du Barry to give her the title of viscountess. \"Better  still,\" exclaimed Jean, \"I will give you the title of countess. My  brother will marry you; he is a male scamp, and you are the female. What  a beautiful marriage!\"    So they were united. The newly made countess was solemnly presented at  court by a countess of an ancient date, namely, the Countess de Bearn.  King Voltaire protested, in a satire entitled \"_The Court of King  Petaud_\" (topsy-turvy), afterwards denying it. The duc de Choiseul  protested, France protested, but all Versailles threw itself  passionately at the feet of the new countess. Even the daughters of the  King paid her court, and allowed her to call them by their pet  names: Loque, Chiffe, and Graille. The King, jealous of this gracious  familiarity, wished her to call him by some pet name, and so the  Bacchante, who believed that through the King she held all France in her  hand, called him \"La France,\" making him a wife to his Gray Musketeers.    Oh, that happy time! Du Barry and Louis XV hid their life--like the  sage--in their little apartments. She honeyed his chocolate, and  he himself made her coffee. Royalty consecrated a new verb for the  dictionary of the Academy, and Madame du Barry said to the King: \"At  home, I can love you to madness.\" The King gave the castle of Lucienne  to his mistress in order to be able to sing the same song. Truly the  Romeo and Juliet _de la main gauche_.    Du Barry threw out her fish-wifely epithets with ineffable tenderness.  She only opened her eyes half way, even when she took him by the throat.  The King was enchanted by these humors. It was a new world. But someone  said to him: \"Ah, Sire, it is easy to see that your Majesty has never  been at the house of Gourdan.\"    Yet Du Barry was adored by poets and artists. She extended both hands to  them. Jeanne's beauty had a penetrating, singular charm. At once she  was blonde and brunette--black eyebrows and lashes with blue eyes,  rebellious light hair with darker shadows, cheeks of ideal contour,  whose pale rose tints were often heightened by two or three touches--a  lie \"formed by the hand of Love,\" as anthology puts it--a nose with  expressive nostrils, an air of childlike candour, and a look seductive  to intoxication. A bold yet shrinking Venus, a Hebe yet a Bacchante.  With much grace Voltaire says:    \"Madame:    \"M. de la Borde tells me that you have ordered him to kiss me on both  cheeks for you:    \"What! Two kisses at life's end What a passport to send me! Two is one  too much, Adorable Nymph; I should die of pleasure at the first.    \"He showed me your portrait, and be not offended, Madame, when I tell  you that I have taken the liberty of giving that the two kisses.\"    Perhaps Voltaire would not have written this letter, had he not read the  one written by the King to the Duc de Choiseul, who refused to pay court  to the left-hand queen:    \"My Cousin,    \"The discontent which your acts cause me forces me to exile you to  Chanteloup, where you will take yourself within twenty-four hours. I  would have sent you farther away were it not for the particular esteem  in which I hold Madame de Choiseul. With this, I pray God, my cousin, to  take you into His safe and holy protection.\" \"Louis.\"    This exile was the only crime of the courtesan. On none of her enemies  did she close the gates of the Bastille. And more than once did she  place a pen in the hands of Louis XV with which to sign a pardon.  Sometimes, indeed, she was ironic in her compassion.    \"Madame,\" said M. de Sartines to her one day, \"I have discovered a rogue  who is scattering songs about you; what is to be done with him?\"    \"Sentence him to sing them for a livelihood.\"    But she afterwards made the mistake of pensioning Chevalier de Morande  to buy silence.    The pleasures of the King and his favorite were troubled only by the  fortune-tellers. Neither the King nor the countess believed in the  predictions of the philosophers, but they did believe in divination. One  day, returning from Choisy, Louis XV found under a cushion of his coach  a slip of paper on which was transcribed this prediction of the monk  Aimonius, the savant who could read all things from the vast book of the  stars:    \"As soon as Childeric had returned from Thuringia, he was crowned King  of France And no sooner was he King than he espoused Basine, wife of the  King of Thuringia. She came herself to find Childeric. The first night  of the marriage, and before the King had retired, the queen begged  Childeric to look from one of the palace windows which opened on a park,  and tell what he saw there. Childeric looked out and, much terrified,  reported to the princess that he had seen tigers and lions. Basine sent  him a second time to look out. This time the prince only saw bears and  wolves, and the third time he perceived only cats and dogs, fighting  and combating each other. Then Basine said to him: I will give you  an explanation of what you have seen: The first figure shows you  your successors, who will excel you in courage and power; the second  represents another race which will be illustrious for their conquests,  and which will augment your kingdom for many centuries; but the third  denotes the end of your kingdom, which will be given over to pleasures  and will lose to you the friendship of your subjects; and this because  the little animals signify a people who, emancipated from fear of  princes, will massacre them and make war upon each other.\"    Louis read the prediction and passed the paper to the Countess: \"After  us the end of the world,\" said she gaily. The King laughed, but the abbe  de Beauvais celebrated high mass at Versailles after the carnival of  1774, and dared to say, in righteous anger: \"This carnival is the last;  yet forty days and Nineveh shall perish.\" Louis turned pale. \"Is it God  who speaks thus?\" murmured he, raising his eyes to the altar. The next  day he went to the hunt in grand style, but from that evening he was  afraid of solitude and silence: \"It is like the tomb; I do not wish  to put myself in such a place,\" said he to Madame du Barry. The duc  de Richelieu tried to divert him. \"No,\" said he suddenly, as if the  Trappist's denunciation had again recurred to him, \"I shall be at ease  only when these forty days have passed.\" He died on the fortieth day.    Du Barry believed neither in God nor in the devil, but she believed in  the almanac of Liege. She scarcely read any book but this--faithful to  her earliest habits. And the almanac of Liege, in its prediction for  April, 1774, said: \"A woman, the greatest of favorites, will play her  last role.\" So Madame the Countess du Barry said without ceasing:  \"I shall not be tranquil until these forty days have passed.\" The  thirty-seventh day the King went to the hunt attended with all the  respect due to his rank. Jeanne wept in silence and prayed to God as one  who has long neglected her prayers.    Louis XV had not neglected his prayers, and gave two hundred thousand  livres to the poor, besides ordering masses at St. Genevieve. Parliament  opened the shrine, and knelt gravely before that miraculous relic. The  least serious of all these good worshippers was, strange to say, the  curate of St. Genevieve: \"Ah, well!\" said he gaily, when Louis was dead,  \"let us continue to talk of the miracles of St. Genevieve. Of what can  you complain? Is not the King dead?\"    At the last moment it was not God who held the heart of Louis--it was  his mistress. \"Ask the Countess to come here again,\" he said.    \"Sire, you know that she has gone away,\" they answered.    \"Ah! has she gone? Then I must go!\" So he departed.    His end drew forth some maledictions. There were insults even at his  funeral services. \"Nevertheless,\" said one old soldier, \"he was at the  battle of Fontenoy.\" That was the most eloquent funeral oration of Louis  XV.    \"The King is dead, long live the King!\" But before the death of Louis  XVI they cried: \"The king is dead, long live the Republic!\"    Rose-colored mourning was worn in the good city of Paris. The funeral  oration of the King and a lament for his mistress were pronounced by  Sophie Arnould, of which masterpiece of sacred eloquence the last words  only are preserved: \"Behold us orphaned both of father and mother.\"    If Madame du Barry was one of the seven plagues of royalty, she died  faithful to royalty. After her exile to Pont aux Dames she returned to  Lucienne, where the duc de Cosse Brissac consoled her for the death of  Louis XV. But what she loved in Louis was that he was a king; her true  country was Versailles; her true light was the sun of court life. Like  Montespan, also a courtesan of high order, she often went in these dark  days to cast a loving look upon the solitary park in the maze of the  Trianon. Yet she was particularly happy at Lucienne.    I have compared her to Manon Lescaut, and I believe her to have been  also a sister to Ganesin. All three were destroyed by passion.    One day she found herself still young at Lucienne, although her sun was  setting. She loved the duc de Brissac, and how many pages of her past  romance would she that day have liked to erase and forget!    \"Why do you weep, Countess?\" asked her lover.    \"My friend,\" she responded, \"I weep because I love you, shall I say it?  I weep because I am happy.\"    She was right; happiness is a festival that should know no to-morrow.  But on the morrow of her happiness, the Revolution knocked at the castle  gate of Lucienne.    \"Who goes there?\"    \"I am justice; prepare for destiny.\"    The Queen, the true queen, had been good to her as to everybody. Marie  Antoinette remembered that the favorite had not been wicked. The debts  of Du Barry were paid and money enough was given to her so that she  could still give with both hands. Lucienne became"]]]
