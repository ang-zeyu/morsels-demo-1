HOW TO CLEAN A RIFLE AND BAYONET      Get a rag and rub the heavy grease off; then get a soft pine stick,  pointed at one end, and with this point remove the grease from the  cracks, crevices and corners. Clean the bore from the breech. When the  heavy grease has been removed, the metal part of the gun, bore included,  should be covered with a light coating of \"3-in-1\" oil. Heavy grease can  be removed from the rifle by rubbing it with a rag which has been  saturated with gasoline or coal oil.        FRIENDS      There are a few men in all companies who play, loaf, and who are  constantly in trouble. As the good men in each company will not become  friendly with them, they seek their acquaintances among the new men on  whom they have a baneful influence. We wish to warn you about making  friends too quickly.        FINAL SUGGESTIONS      Don't be profane or tell questionable stories to your bunkies or around  the company. There is a much greater number of silent and unprotesting  men in camp than is generally supposed, to whom this is offensive. Keep  everything on a high plane.          CHAPTER II[1]    Read this chapter as soon as you decide to attend a Camp.        PHYSICAL EXERCISE      The greatest problem you will have to solve will be that of making your  body do the work required. Every one else will be doing exactly what you  are doing, and you have too much pride to want to take even a shorter  step than the man by your side. Some men have to leave the training  camps because they are not in the proper physical condition to go on  with the work. If this chapter is taken as seriously as it should be, it  will be of great help to you.    If you have not a pair of sensible marching shoes (tan, high-tops, no  hooks on them) get a pair. These shoes should be considerably larger  than a pair of office shoes.    Walk to and from your business. Take every opportunity to get out in the  country where the air is pure. Fill your lungs full. Get into the habit  of taking deep breaths now and then. Don't make this a task, but  surround it with pleasantries. Get some delightful companion to walk  with you. Walk vigorously.    Let down on your smoking. Better to leave it alone for a while. You will  enjoy the air. Deep breathing seems to be more natural.    Make it a work for your country. View it in that light. If you are not  going to be called upon to undergo the cruel hardships and physical  strain of some campaigns, your son will be, and you can be of great help  to him by being fit yourself. You and your sons will form the backbone  of America's strength in her next peril.    You will have a great deal of walking after you arrive in camp, possibly  a great deal more than you have ever had, and probably a great deal more  than you expect, even with this word of warning. If you have failed to  provide yourself with proper shoes and socks, great will be the price of  your lack of forethought. You will wince at your own blisters. You will  get no sympathy from any one else. It is the spirit of the camp for each  man to bear his own burdens. So arrive at camp with hardened legs and  broken in shoes. Don't buy shoes with pointed or narrow toes. They  should be broad and airy.    Immediately after you arise in the morning and just before you retire at  night, go through the following exercises for two or three minutes. In a  short time you may want to make it more. No objection. Give it a fair  trial. Be brisk and energetic. Forget, for the time being, what you are  going to get out of it. Give and then give more. The result will take  care of itself.      1st Exercise    Involving practically every important muscle in the body.    [Illustration: No. 1 No. 2]    From first position spring to second position; instantly return to first  position and continue.    Be light on your feet. Alight on your toes. Begin with a limited number  of times. Day by day increase it a little until you reach a fair number.  Be most moderate at first. Never allow yourself in any exercise to  become greatly fatigued.      2d Exercise    To reduce waist, strengthen back muscles, and become limber.    [Illustration: No. 1 No. 2]    Assume position No. 1.    Swing to position (No. 2), return at once to No. 1, and continue.    Shoot your head and arms as far through your legs as your conformation  permits.      3rd Exercise    To harden leg muscles and exercise joints.    [Illustration: No. 1 No. 2]    From position No. 1 come to position No. 2. Return at once to No. 1 and  continue.    Toes turned well out. Body and head erect. Up with a slight spring.  After a little practice, you will have no difficulty with this exercise  in balancing yourself.      4th Exercise    To exercise arms and shoulders and organs of chest and shoulder muscles.    [Illustration: No. 1]    From position No. 1 thrust arms forward to position No. 2, and return at  once to position No. 1.    [Illustration: No. 2]    Vary by thrusting arms downward, sideward and upward. Be moderate at  first. Grow more vigorous with practice.      5th Exercise    [Illustration: No. 1]    To strengthen ankles and insteps.

[Illustration: No. 2]          CHAPTER III    SCHOOL OF THE SOLDIER    Based on the Infantry Drill Regulations        Success in battle is the ultimate object of all military training; hence  the excellence of an organization is judged by its field efficiency.  Your instruction will be progressive in character, and will have as its  ultimate purpose the creation of a company measuring up to a high  standard of field efficiency.    The Preparatory Command, such as Forward, indicates the movement that is  to be executed.    The Command of Execution, such as MARCH, HALT, or ARMS, commences the  execution of the movement.    Preparatory Commands are distinguished by bold face, those of execution  by capitals. As, 1. Forward, 2. MARCH.    The average man understands better and learns faster when you show him  how a thing is done. Don't be content with telling him how. Bear this in  mind when you become an instructor.    On account of the absence of the Regular Army on the border, it was not  practical to obtain photographs of regular troops with which to  illustrate this book. The photographs used were taken under the direct  supervision of the authors.        POSITION OF A SOLDIER AT ATTENTION      [Illustration: No. 1 No. 2 CORRECT POSITION]    No. 1. Eyes to the front.
