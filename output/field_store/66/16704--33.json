The gallant little meat-carver labored with success  to settle various suits pending, and thought {10} he had everything  compounded; but just as he was about to sail he was arrested for  another debt of five hundred ducats.  A friend at last advanced the  money for him and he got away ten days after Ojeda.  It would have been  a good thing if no friend had ever interfered and he had been detained  indefinitely at Hispaniola.      III. The Adventures of Ojeda    Ojeda made a landfall at what is known now as Cartagena.  It was not a  particularly good place for a settlement.  There was no reason on earth  why they should stay there at all.  La Cosa, who had been along the  coast several times and knew it thoroughly, warned his youthful  captain--to whom he was blindly and devotedly attached, by the  way--that the place was extremely dangerous; that the inhabitants were  fierce, brave and warlike, and that they had a weapon almost as  effectual as the Spanish guns.  That was the poisoned arrow.  Ojeda  thought he knew everything and he turned a deaf ear to all  remonstrances.  He hoped he might chance upon an opportunity of  surprising an Indian village and capturing a lot of inoffensive  inhabitants for slaves, already a very profitable part of voyaging to  the Indies.    He landed without much difficulty, assembled the natives and read to  them a perfectly absurd manifesto, which had been prepared in Spain for  use in similar contingencies, summoning them to change their religion  and to acknowledge the supremacy of Spain.  Not one word of this did  the natives understand and to it they responded with a volley of  poisoned arrows.  The Spanish considered this paper a most {11}  valuable document, and always went through the formality of having the  publication of it attested by a notary public.    Ojeda seized some seventy-five captives, male and female, as slaves.  They were sent on board the ships.  The Indian warriors, infuriated  beyond measure, now attacked in earnest the shore party, comprising  seventy men, among whom were Ojeda and La Cosa.  The latter, unable to  prevent him, had considered it proper to go ashore with the hot-headed  governor to restrain him so far as was possible.  Ojeda impetuously  attacked the Indians and, with part of his men, pursued them several  miles inland to their town, of which he took possession.    The savages, in constantly increasing numbers, clustered around the  town and attacked the Spaniards with terrible persistence.  Ojeda and  his followers took refuge in huts and enclosures and fought valiantly.  Finally all were killed, or fatally wounded by the envenomed darts  except Ojeda himself and a few men, who retreated to a small palisaded  enclosure.  Into this improvised fort the Indians poured a rain of  poisoned arrows which soon struck down every one but the governor  himself.  Being small of stature and extremely agile, and being  provided with a large target or shield, he was able successfully to  fend off the deadly arrows from his person.  It was only a question of  time before the Indians would get him and he would die in the frightful  agony which his men experienced after being infected with the poison  upon the arrow-points.  In his extremity, he was rescued by La Cosa who  had kept in hand a moiety of the shore party.    The advent of La Cosa saved Ojeda.  Infuriated at the slaughter of his  men, Ojeda rashly and {12} intemperately threw himself upon the  savages, at once disappearing from the view of La Cosa and his men, who  were soon surrounded and engaged in a desperate battle on their own  account.  They, too, took refuge in the building, from which they were  forced to tear away the thatched roof that might have shielded them  from the poisoned arrows, in fear lest the Indians might set it on  fire.  And they in turn were also reduced to the direst of straits.  One after another was killed, and finally La Cosa himself, who had been  desperately wounded before, received a mortal hurt; while but one man  remained on his feet.    Possibly thinking that they had killed the whole party, and withdrawing  to turn their attention to Ojeda, furiously ranging the forest alone,  the Indians left the two surviving Spaniards unmolested, whereupon the  dying La Cosa bade his comrade leave him, and if possible get word to  Ojeda of the fate which had overtaken him.  This man succeeded in  getting back to the shore and apprised the men there of the frightful  disaster.    The ships cruised along the shore, sending parties into the bay at  different points looking for Ojeda and any others who might have  survived.  A day or two after the battle they came across their  unfortunate commander.  He was lying on his back in a grove of  mangroves, upheld from the water by the gnarled and twisted roots of  one of the huge trees.  He had his naked sword in his hand and his  target on his arm, but he was completely prostrated and speechless.  The men took him to a fire, revived him and finally brought him back to  the ship.    Marvelous to relate, he had not a single wound upon him!    {13}    Great was the grief of the little squadron at this dolorous state of  affairs.  In the middle of it, the ships of Nicuesa hove in sight.  Mindful of their previous quarrels, Ojeda decided to stay ashore until  he found out what were Nicuesa's intentions toward him.  Cautiously his  men broke the news to Nicuesa.  With magnanimity and courtesy  delightful to contemplate, he at once declared that he had forgotten  the quarrel and offered every assistance to Ojeda to enable him to  avenge himself.  Ojeda thereupon rejoined the squadron, and the two  rivals embraced with many protestations of friendship amid the acclaim  of their followers.    The next night, four hundred men were secretly assembled.  They landed  and marched to the Indian town, surrounded it and put it to the flames.  The defenders fought with their usual resolution, and many of the  Spaniards were killed by the poisonous arrows, but to no avail.  The  Indians were doomed, and the whole village perished then and there.    Nicuesa had landed some of his horses, and such was the terror inspired  by those remarkable and unknown animals that several of the women who  had escaped from the fire, when they caught sight of the frightful  monsters, rushed back into the flames, preferring this horrible death  rather than to meet the horses.  The value of the plunder amounted to  eighteen thousand dollars in modern money, the most of which Nicuesa  took.    The two adventurers separated, Nicuesa bidding Ojeda farewell and  striking boldly across the Caribbean for Veragua, which was the name  Columbus had given to the Isthmian coast below Honduras; while Ojeda  crept along the shore seeking a convenient {14} spot to plant his  colony.  Finally he established himself at a place which he named San  Sebastian.  One of his ships was wrecked and many of his men were lost.  Another was sent back to Santo Domingo with what little treasure they  had gathered and with an appeal to Encisco to hurry up.    They made a rude fort on the shore, from which to prosecute their  search for gold and slaves.  The Indians, who also belonged to the  poisoned-arrow fraternity, kept the fort in constant anxiety.  Many  were the conflicts between the Spaniards and the savages, and terrible  were the losses inflicted by the invaders; but there seemed to be no  limit to the number of Indians, while every Spaniard killed was a  serious drain upon the little party.  Man after man succumbed to the  effects of the dreadful poison.  Ojeda, who never spared himself in any  way, never received a wound.    From their constant fighting, the savages got to recognize him as the  leader and they used all their skill to compass destruction.  Finally,  they succeeded in decoying him into an ambush where four of their best  men had been posted.  Recklessly exposing themselves, the Indians at  close range opened fire upon their prisoner with arrows.  Three of the  arrows he caught on his buckler, but the fourth pierced his thigh.  It  is surmised that Ojeda attended to the four Indians before taking  cognizance of his wound.  The arrow, of course, was poisoned, and  unless something could be done, it meant death.    He resorted to a truly heroic expedient.  He caused two iron plates to  be heated white-hot and then directed the surgeon to apply the plates  to the wound, one at the entrance and the other at the exit of the  arrow.  {15} The surgeon, appalled by the idea of such torture, refused  to do so, and it was not until Ojeda threatened to hang him with his  own hands that he consented.  Ojeda bore the frightful agony without a  murmur or a quiver, such was his extraordinary endurance.  It was the  custom in that day to bind patients who were operated upon surgically,  that their involuntary movements might not disconcert the doctors and  cause them to wound where they hoped to cure.  Ojeda refused even to be  bound.  The remedy was efficacious, although the heat of the iron, in  the language of the ancient chronicler, so entered his system that they  used a barrel of vinegar to cool him off.    Ojeda was very much dejected by the fact that he had been wounded.  It  seemed to him that the Virgin, his patron, had deserted him.  The  little band, by this time reduced to less than one hundred people, was  in desperate straits.  Starvation stared it in the face when  fortunately assistance came.  One Bernardino de Talavera, with seventy  congenial cut-throats, absconding debtors and escaped criminals, from  Hispaniola, had seized a Genoese trading-ship loaded with provisions  and had luckily reached San Sebastian in her.  They sold these  provisions to Ojeda and his men at exorbitant prices, for some of the  hard-earned treasure which they had amassed with their great  expenditure of life and health.    There was no place else for Talavera and his gang to go, so "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20912"],[0,"The Daffodil Mystery (#3)"],[1,"past,\" he said speaking with  deliberation, \"about small sums of money being missing from the cashier's  office.\"    It was a bold thing to say, and in many ways a rash thing. He was  dependent for the success of his hastily-formed plan, not only upon  Milburgh's guilt, but upon Milburgh's willingness to confess his guilt.  If the manager agreed to stand sponsor to this lie, he admitted his own  peculations, and Tarling, to whom the turn of the conversation had at  first been unintelligible, began dimly to see the drift it was taking.    \"I have complained that sums of money have been missing for the past  month?\" repeated Milburgh dully.    The smile had gone from his lips and eyes. His face was haggard--he was a  man at bay.    \"That is what I said,\" said Lyne watching him. \"Isn't that the fact?\"    There was a long pause, and presently Milburgh nodded.    \"That is the fact, sir,\" he said in a low voice.    \"And you have told me that you suspected Miss Rider of defalcations?\"    Again the pause and again the man nodded.    \"Do you hear?\" asked Lyne triumphantly.    \"I hear,\" said Tarling quietly. \"Now what do you wish me to do? Isn't  this a matter for the police? I mean the regular police.\"    Lyne frowned.    \"The case has to be prepared first,\" he said. \"I will give you full  particulars as to the girl's address and her habits, and it will be your  business to collect such information as will enable us to put the case in  the hands of Scotland Yard.\"    \"I see,\" said Tarling and smiled again. Then he shook his head. \"I'm  afraid I can't come into this case, Mr. Lyne.\"    \"Can't come in?\" said Lyne in astonishment. \"Why not?\"    \"Because it's not my kind of job,\" said Tarling. \"The first time I met  you I had a feeling that you were leading me to one of the biggest cases  I had ever undertaken. It shows you how one's instincts can lead one  astray,\" he smiled again, and picked up his hat.    \"What do you mean? You're going to throw up a valuable client?\"    \"I don't know how valuable you're likely to be,\" said Tarling, \"but at  the present moment the signs are not particularly encouraging. I tell you  I do not wish to be associated with this case, Mr. Lyne, and I think  there the matter can end.\"    \"You don't think it's worth while, eh?\" sneered Lyne. \"Yet when I tell  you that I am prepared to give you a fee of five hundred guineas----\"    \"If you gave me a fee of five thousand guineas, or fifty thousand  guineas, I should still decline to be associated with this matter,\" said  Tarling, and his words had the metallic quality which precludes argument.    \"At any rate, I am entitled to know why you will not take up this case.  Do you know the girl?\" asked Lyne loudly.    \"I have never met the lady and probably never shall,\" said Tarling. \"I  only know that I will not be concerned with what is called in the United  States of America a 'frame up.'\"    \"Frame up?\" repeated the other.    \"A frame up. I dare say you know what it means--I will put the matter  more plainly and within your understanding. For some reason or other you  have a sudden grudge against a member of your staff. I read your face,  Mr. Lyne, and the weakness of your chin and the appetite of your mouth  suggest to me that you are not over scrupulous with the women who are in  your charge. I guess rather than know that you have been turned down with  a dull, sickening thud by a decent girl, and in your mortification you  are attempting to invent a charge which has no substance and no  foundation.    \"Mr. Milburgh,\" he turned to the other, and again Mr. Milburgh ceased to  smile, \"has his own reasons for complying with your wishes. He is your  subordinate, and moreover, the side threat of penal servitude for him if  he refuses has carried some weight.\"    Thornton Lyne's face was distorted with fury.    \"I will take care that your behaviour is widely advertised,\" he said.  \"You have brought a most monstrous charge against me, and I shall proceed  against you for slander. The truth is that you are not equal to the job I  intended giving you and you are finding an excuse for getting out.\"    \"The truth is,\" replied Tarling, biting off the end of a cigar he had  taken from his pocket, \"that my reputation is too good to be risked in  associating with such a dirty business as yours. I hate to be rude, and  I hate just as much to throw away good money. But I can't take good money  for bad work, Mr. Lyne, and if you will be advised by me, you will drop  this stupid scheme for vengeance which your hurt vanity has suggested--it  is the clumsiest kind of frame up that was ever invented--and also you  will go and apologise to the young lady, whom, I have no doubt, you have  grossly insulted.\"    He beckoned to his Chinese satellite and walked leisurely to the door.  Incoherent with rage, shaking in every limb with a weak man's sense of  his own impotence, Lyne watched him until the door was half-closed, then,  springing forward with a strangled cry, he wrenched the door open and  leapt at the detective.    Two hands gripped his arm and lifting him bodily back into the room,  pushed him down into a chair. A not unkindly face blinked down at him,  a face relieved from utter solemnity by the tiny laughter lines about  the eyes.    \"Mr. Lyne,\" said the mocking voice of Tarling, \"you are setting an awful  example to the criminal classes. It is a good job your convict friend is  in gaol.\"    Without another word he left the room.          CHAPTER III    THE MAN WHO LOVED LYNE      Two days later Thornton Lyne sat in his big limousine which was drawn up  on the edge of Wandsworth Common, facing the gates of the gaol.    Poet and _poseur_ he was, the strangest combination ever seen in man.    Thornton Lyne was a store-keeper, a Bachelor of Arts, the winner of the  Mangate Science Prize and the author of a slim volume. The quality of the  poetry therein was not very great--but it was undoubtedly a slim volume  printed in queerly ornate type with old-fashioned esses and wide margins.  He was a store-keeper because store-keeping supplied him with caviare and  peaches, a handsome little two-seater, a six-cylinder limousine for state  occasions, a country house and a flat in town, the decorations of which  ran to a figure which would have purchased many stores of humbler  pretensions than Lyne's Serve First Emporium.    To the elder Lyne, Joseph Emanuel of that family, the inception and  prosperity of Lyne's Serve First Emporium was due. He had devised a sale  system which ensured every customer being attended to the moment he or  she entered one of the many departments which made up the splendid whole  of the emporium. It was a system based upon the age-old principle of  keeping efficient reserves within call.    Thornton Lyne succeeded to the business at a moment when his slim volume  had placed him in the category of the gloriously misunderstood. Because  such reviewers as had noticed his book wrote of his \"poetry\" using  inverted commas to advertise their scorn, and because nobody bought the  volume despite its slimness, he became the idol of men and women who also  wrote that which nobody read, and in consequence developed souls with the  celerity that a small boy develops stomachache.    For nothing in the wide world was more certain to the gloriously  misunderstood than this: the test of excellence is scorn. Thornton Lyne  might in different circumstances have drifted upward to sets even more  misunderstood--yea, even to a set superior to marriage and soap and clean  shirts and fresh air--only his father died of a surfeit, and Thornton  became the Lyne of Lyne's Serve First.    His first inclination was to sell the property and retire to a villa in  Florence or Capri. Then the absurdity, the rich humour of an idea, struck  him. He, a scholar, a gentleman and a misunderstood poet, sitting in the  office of a store, appealed to him. Somebody remarked in his hearing that  the idea was \"rich.\" He saw himself in \"character\" and the part appealed  to him. To everybody's surprise he took up his father's work, which meant  that he signed cheques, collected profits and left the management to the  Soults and the Neys whom old Napoleon Lyne had relied upon in the  foundation of his empire.    Thornton wrote an address to his 3,000 employees--which address was  printed on decided antique paper in queerly ornate type with wide  margins. He quoted Seneca, Aristotle, Marcus Aurelius and the \"Iliad.\"  The \"address\" secured better and longer reviews in the newspapers than  had his book.    He had found life a pleasant experience--all the more piquant because of  the amazement of innumerable ecstatic friends who clasped their hands  and asked awefully: \"How _can_ you--a man of your temperament...!\"    Life might have gone on being pleasant if every man and woman he had met  had let him have his own way. Only there were at least two people with  whom Thornton Lyne's millions carried no weight.    It was warm in his limousine, which was electrically heated. But outside,  on that raw April morning, it was bitterly cold, and the shivering little  group of women who stood at a respectful distance from the prison gates,  drew their shawls tightly about them as errant flakes of snow whirled  across the open. The common was covered with a white powder, and the  early flowers looked supremely miserable in their wintry setting.    The prison clock struck eight, and a wicket-gate opened. A man slouched  out, his jacket buttoned up to his neck, his cap pulled over his eyes. At  sight of him, Lyne dropped the newspaper he had been reading, opened the  door of the car and jumped out, walking towards the released prisoner.    \"Well, Sam,\" he said, genially \"you didn't expect me?\"    The man stopped as if he had been shot, and stood staring at the  fur-coated figure. Then:    \"Oh, Mr. Lyne,\" he said brokenly. \"Oh, guv'nor!\" he choked, and tears  streamed down his face, and he gripped"]]]
