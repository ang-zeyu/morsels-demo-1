For the body can become a  marvellous instrument of beauty and harmony when it vibrates in tune  with artistic imagination and collaborates with creative thought. It is  not enough that, thanks to special exercises, students of music should  have corrected their faults and be no longer in danger of spoiling their  musical interpretations by their lack of physical skill and harmonious  movements; it is necessary in addition that the music which lives within  them--artists will understand me--should obtain free and complete  development, and that the rhythms which inspire their personality should  enter into intimate communion with those which animate the works to be  interpreted.    The education of the nervous system must be of such a nature that the  suggested rhythms of a work of art induce in the individual analogous  vibrations, produce a powerful reaction in him and change naturally into  rhythms of expression. In simpler language, the body must become capable  of responding to artistic rhythms and of realizing them quite naturally  without fear of exaggeration.    This faculty of emotion, indispensable to the artist, was formerly  natural to almost all beginners in music, for hardly any but  pre-destined artists devoted themselves to the art; but, if this is no  longer the case, it is possible at least to awaken dulled faculties, to  develop and co-ordinate them, and it is the duty of every musical  educationalist to deter from instrumental technique every individual who  is still without musical feeling.    The experimental study of rhythm should form a part of every  well-organized musical education, and this study will be useful not only  to musicians, but to music itself. It is quite certain that, if since  Beethoven's time harmony has developed, if each generation has created  fresh groupings of sounds, it is not the same regarding rhythmic forms,  which remain much as they were.    I shall be told that the means of expression are of no importance so  long as the artist is able to show his meaning, that a sincere emotion  can be clearly expressed even with old-fashioned rhythms, and that to  try and create new rhythms is mere technical work, and to enforce such  upon the composers of to-morrow is simply depriving them of their  character. This is all true, and I myself have a horror of seeking new  means of expression within the limits of hard and fast rules, for  expression ought to be a spontaneous manifestation. But I assert that  experiments in rhythm, and the complete study of movements simple and  combined, ought to create a fresh mentality, that artists thus trained  will find inevitably and spontaneously new rhythmic forms to express  their feelings, and that in consequence their characters will be able  to develop more completely and with greater strength. It is a fact that  very young children taught by my method invent quite naturally physical  rhythms such as would have occurred to very few professional musicians,  and that my most advanced pupils find monotonous many contemporary works  the rhythmic poverty of which shocks neither public nor critics.    I will terminate this short sketch of my system by pointing out the  intimate relations which exist between movements in time and movements  in space, between rhythms in sound and rhythm in the body, between Music  and Plastic Expression.    Gestures and attitudes of the body complete, animate and enliven any  rhythmic music written simply and naturally without special regard to  tone, and, just as in painting there exist side by side a school of the  nude and a school of landscape, so in music there may be developed, side  by side, plastic music and music pure and simple. In the school of  landscape painting emotion is created entirely by combinations of moving  light and by the rhythms thus caused. In the school of the nude, which  pictures the many shades of expression of the human body, the artist  tries to show the human soul as expressed by physical forms, enlivened  by the emotions of the moment, and at the same time the characteristics  suitable to the individual and his race, such as they appear through  momentary physical modifications.    In the same way, plastic music will picture human feelings expressed by  gesture and will model its sound forms on those of rhythms derived  directly from expressive movements of the human body.    To compose the music which the Greeks appear to have realized, and for  which Goethe and Schiller hoped, musicians must have acquired experience  of physical movements; this, however, is certainly not the case to-day,  for music has become beyond all others an intellectual art. While  awaiting this transformation, present generations can apply education by  and for rhythm to the interpretation of plastic stage music such as  Richard Wagner has imagined. At the present day this music is not  interpreted at all, for dramatic singers, stage managers and conductors  do not understand the relation existing between gesture and music, and  the absolute ignorance regarding plastic expression which characterizes  the lyric actors of our day is a real profanation of scenic musical art.  Not only are singers allowed to walk and gesticulate on the stage  without paying any attention to the time, but also no shade of  expression, dynamic or motor, of the orchestra--crescendo, decrescendo,  accelerando, rallentando--finds in their gestures adequate realization.  By this I mean the kind of wholly instinctive transformation of sound  movements into bodily movements such as my method teaches.    Authors, poets, musicians and painters cannot demand from the  interpreters of their works knowledge of the relations between movements  in time and in space, for this knowledge can only be developed by  special studies. No doubt a few poets and painters have an inborn  knowledge of the rhythms of space; for instance, Hugo von Hofmannsthal,  the stage mounter of \"Electra\" at the Vienna Opera, who constructed a  huge staircase, on which, however, the actors, having little  acquaintance with the most elementary notions of balance, moved with  deplorable heaviness; or again, the aesthetician Adolphe Appia, whose  remarkable work _Music and Stage Mounting_ ought to be the guide of all  stage managers. But the majority of composers write their plastic music  without knowing whether it is capable of being practically realized,  without personal experience of the laws of weight, force and bodily  movement.    My hope is, that sincere artists desirous of perfection and seeking  progress will study seriously the grave question which I raise. For my  own part, relying on many experiments, and full of confidence in ideas  carefully thought out, I have devoted my life to the teaching of rhythm,  being fully satisfied that, thanks to it, man will regain his natural  powers of expression, and at the same time his full motor faculties, and  that art has everything to hope from new generations brought up in the  cult of harmony, of physical and mental health, of order, beauty and  truth.          FROM THE LECTURES OF EMILE JAQUES-DALCROZE    (LECTURE AT LEIPZIG, DECEMBER 10, 1911)      The objection is often raised that under my system the technique of an  instrument is acquired too late. But this objection has no foundation in  fact. A child who begins rhythmic gymnastics as I would have it in its  fifth or sixth year and a year later ear-training, can certainly have  piano lessons when eight years old, and I can state from experience that  the finger technique of the child will then develop much more quickly,  for the musical faculties in general will have been far better  developed, more thoroughly trained and become more part of the child's  life owing to the preliminary training.           *       *       *       *       *    Lessons in rhythmic gymnastics help children in their other lessons, for  they develop the powers of observation, of analyzing, of understanding  and of memory, thus making them more orderly and precise.           *       *       *       *       *    The effect of rhythmic training on the time-table and life of a school  is like that of a hot water heating system which spreads an equal warmth  through all parts of a building. Teachers of other subjects will find  that such training provides them with pupils more responsive, more  elastic and of more character than they otherwise would be. Therefore,  the study of rhythm, as well as education by means of rhythm, ought to  be most closely connected with school life.        [Illustration: The College.]           *       *       *       *       *    (ADDRESS TO THE DRESDEN TEACHERS' ASSOCIATION, MAY 28, 1912)    From many years' experience of music teaching I have gradually produced  a method which gives a child musical experiences instead of musical  knowledge.    I expect much from education in rhythm in elementary schools, provided  it be given regularly, completely and sufficiently. The exercises should  be begun at the age of six, with half an hour's lesson three times a  week, but these lessons can quite well be taken from playtime. By the  age of twelve two lessons a week are sufficient. This training will not  only develop the feeling for beauty and form by accustoming the eye to  distinguish beautiful movements and lines from those that are ugly, but  also render the children susceptible to musical impressions.    There are always children who are not able to sing in time, or even to  beat time, to walk in time, or to graduate the strength and rapidity of  their movements. Such children are unrhythmic, and it will generally be  noticed that these children are stiff and awkward, often also  over-excitable. This lack of rhythm is almost like a disease. It is  caused by the lack of balance between the mental"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21654"],[0,"In and Around Berlin (#3)"],[1,"of higher education among German women leaves them an especial prey to  idle curiosity and gossip. Not only is one questioned freely as to the  cost of any article of dress by comparative strangers, but questions  as to one's family and private affairs are common, almost customary.  Conversation which does not turn upon such things, or on others  equally trivial and irrelevant, is the exception. The recital on their  part, however, of personal and family history has a charming  good-nature and simplicity, and often a touch of the homely and  pathetic, which reach the heart of the listener. There were few tables  where the conversation was not too loud for our comfort. No one seemed  particularly to care for quiet talk with his neighbor, but the  conversation at a long table was a rattling sharpshooting or a heavy  cannonade from one end to the other, mingled with hearty laughter,  while \"Attic salt\" was sparing. Table-manners, even among otherwise  charming people, were often shocking to the taste of Americans. What  we should call the first principles of good-breeding were freely  contravened. The nicety and daintiness which in some favored American  and English homes make of the family board a visible and tangible  poem, were very rare in our German experience. And yet there are  charming German tables and well-bred German ladies and gentlemen. One  custom which we have been taught to regard as vulgar and profane is  that of constantly using the names of the Deity by way of exclamation  and emphasis in the most ordinary conversation. Being on sufficiently  intimate terms with a German lady, we one day ventured to inquire  deprecatingly about this habit. \"Everybody does it,\" was her candid  reply; and this was the only reason we ever heard.    \"George Eliot\" long ago complained of the inconvenience of  perambulating Berlin streets, where you are pushed off the sidewalks  and are in constant danger of involuntary surgical experience through  contact with the military swords that clank and clatter in the crowd.  There is still room for improvement in this respect. The owners of  sabres often seem to take it for granted that the right of way belongs  first of all to them and their weapons, and if any one is thus  inconvenienced that is the business of the unlucky party. The streets  and sidewalks are much wider and less crowded than those in Boston;  but a collision on a Boston sidewalk is rare, while a half-dozen rude  ones in an hour is a daily expectation in Berlin. A Berlin pedestrian  \"to the manner born,\" in blind momentum and disregard of all  obstacles, has no equal in our experience.    It was told me that if you are run over by the swiftly driven horses  in the streets, you must pay a fine for obstructing the way.  Remembering that many regulations are relics of the times when laws  were made for the good of the aristocracy who ride, and not for the  vulgar crowd who walk, we did not try the experiment. Mounted  policemen are to be seen, like equestrian statues, at the intersection  of the more crowded thoroughfares, as Unter den Linden and Friedrich  Strasse, and with a little care there is seldom need of delay in  crossing. I heard of one poor cab-driver who was fined and cast into  prison for injuring a lady who suddenly changed her mind and took a  new tack while just in front of his horses. Regard for foot-passengers  seems thus to have an existence in some cases.    Regard for women is not a thing to which German men are trained. A  gentleman may not carry a small parcel through the street, but his  delicate wife may take a heavier one to save the disgrace of her  husband's bearing it. Among the middle classes, those couples who go  out for a walk with the baby-carriage invariably regard the management  of it as the wife's privilege, leaving to the father the custody of  his pipe or cigar alone. If the baby is to be carried in arms, it is  always the wife, not the husband, who bears the burden. Women in the  humbler classes wear no bonnets in the street, although sometimes in  cold weather they tie a little shawl or a handkerchief about the head.  Their usual habit is, however, to go out in all weathers with the head  as unprotected as the face, even for long distances. A maid follows  her mistress to market, with a basket on her arm, often covered with  an embroidered cloth, in which are placed the purchases of the careful  housemother.    A huckster is frequently accompanied by a dog, both being harnessed to  the little cart which holds the wares. Often the man will be free,  while the woman and the dog side by side drag the cart to which they  are tied, the woman usually knitting even when the air is cold enough  to benumb her fingers. Women knit constantly in the streets about  their other work, whether bowed down under huge bundles of fagots on  their backs, serving milk at the houses, or doing many other things  with which we should regard knitting as incompatible.    The best society is like the court, in being exclusive. It is  difficult for strangers, in Germany as in America, easily to obtain  desirable acquaintance, except by means of letters of introduction,  and the friendship which comes with time and natural selection.  Glimpses of home-life in cultivated circles are accordingly to be  highly valued.    One delightful visit with supper, to which we were invited, began  about six o'clock. That we might have more in common, the hostess, who  herself spoke English with much intelligence, had invited a German  lady who had resided in Boston to meet us. We were seated on the sofa  and shown some of the many art treasures in the way of fine engravings  which the home contained, the fancy-work of our hostess--a German lady  seems never to be without it--lying neglected as the conversation rose  in interest. Supper was served between eight and nine o'clock, at a  round table accommodating the hostess and her three guests. Delicious  tea, made from a burnished brass teakettle over an alcohol lamp on a  stand beside the hostess, with white and black bread, five kinds of  sausage, cold meat, and pickled fish, composed the first course. There  was a second, composed of little cakes and apples.    Dinner, in our experience, was almost invariably good. First course,  always soup and bread. Second, unless fish were served, some kind of  meat, a variety of vegetables, among which green beans, spinach, and  varieties of cabbage delicately cooked were prominent. This course was  usually accompanied by cooked or preserved fruit. Third course,  various puddings and cakes, all good, some delicious; never any pie.  The luxury of dessert was sometimes omitted. It is not common in  German families, except those frequented by American guests. Radishes  and cheese form an extra course at some suppers. In hotels, of course,  the simple family dinner of three or four courses is replaced by a  more elaborate feast of many courses.    The anniversaries of the death of friends are remembered by dressing  in black, burning candles before their portraits, and visiting their  graves. There is also one day in spring which is celebrated as a kind  of combination of All Saints Day and Decoration Day, when every one  visits the cemeteries, leaving flowers and wreaths in memory of the  loved and lost. Funeral services are held, both at the homes and in  the churches, and are often accompanied by very impressive and  majestic music. In at least one of the cemeteries there is a large and  scientifically arranged crematory. A recent judicial decision,  however, forbids cremation within the municipal jurisdiction.    Sundays, as is well known, are not observed in Germany as in England  and Scotland. But in the parts of Berlin which we were accustomed to  see on that day, including two miles or more between our residence and  the central part of the city, the general sobriety and orderly  appearance would compare favorably with that in the better parts of  many American cities. We were asked on our first Sunday at the  dinner-table if we would like to have seats secured for us at the  opera that evening. Operatic performances and concerts are among the  better entertainments offered on Sunday evenings. The laws are strict,  however, regarding quiet in the streets and the closing of places of  business until after Sunday morning service in the churches. In the  finest residence portions of some American cities we have been  frequently disturbed by the street-cries of hucksters during divine  service on Sunday mornings, while the ear-piercing shouts of newspaper  venders disturb all the peace of the early morning hours. Dime  museums and other places flaunt their attractions in the faces of the  crowd who gather at their doors, and many places of business seem to  be always open. It was not our experience to see or hear anything like  this in Germany. Even the law of despotic power is better than none at  all,--often far better than enlightened law not enforced. Policemen in  the streets of Berlin make short work with the luckless tradesman who  leaves his blinds or doors open on Sunday before two o'clock P.M. Of  course restaurants and places of food supply are open. To all outward  appearance Berlin was a fairly well-ordered city on Sundays. One in  search of evil, however, could doubtless find it, here as elsewhere.    Sunday afternoon is a favorite time for calls and family visits; and  in the pleasant weather the genuine love for out-door life, which  seems dormant in winter, blossoms out luxuriantly. Parents take their  whole families to the numerous gardens in the suburbs for picnics on  Sundays and the frequent holidays. Sunday hours at home are spent by  most German ladies with the inevitable crochet-work or knitting,--even  the most devout seeing no harm in this, nor in their little Sunday  evening parties, with games and music.    One day in the year--Good Friday--is observed as scrupulously as was  ever a"]]]
