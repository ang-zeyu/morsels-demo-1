Then they came to a big cherry garden; there was a little house in  it, with curious blue and red windows, it had a thatched roof, and two  wooden soldiers stood outside, who presented arms as she sailed past.  Gerda called out to them; she thought they were alive, but of course  they did not answer; she was quite close to them, for the current drove  the boat close to the bank. Gerda called out again, louder than before,  and then an old, old woman came out of the house; she was leaning upon a  big, hooked stick, and she wore a big sun hat, which was covered with  beautiful painted flowers.    'You poor little child,' said the old woman, 'how ever were you driven  out on this big, strong river into the wide, wide world alone?' Then she  walked right into the water, and caught hold of the boat with her hooked  stick; she drew it ashore, and lifted little Gerda out.    Gerda was delighted to be on dry land again, but she was a little bit  frightened of the strange old woman.    'Come, tell me who you are, and how you got here,' said she.    When Gerda had told her the whole story and asked her if she had seen  Kay, the woman said she had not seen him, but that she expected him.  Gerda must not be sad, she was to come and taste her cherries and see  her flowers, which were more beautiful than any picture-book; each one  had a story to tell. Then she took Gerda by the hand, they went into the  little house, and the old woman locked the door.    The windows were very high up, and they were red, blue, and yellow;  they threw a very curious light into the room. On the table were  quantities of the most delicious cherries, of which Gerda had leave to  eat as many as ever she liked. While she was eating, the old woman  combed her hair with a golden comb, so that the hair curled, and shone  like gold round the pretty little face, which was as sweet as a rose.    'I have long wanted a little girl like you!' said the old woman. 'You  will see how well we shall get on together.' While she combed her hair  Gerda had forgotten all about Kay, for the old woman was learned in the  magic art; but she was not a bad witch, she only cast spells over people  for a little amusement, and she wanted to keep Gerda. She therefore went  into the garden and waved her hooked stick over all the rose-bushes, and  however beautifully they were flowering, all sank down into the rich  black earth without leaving a trace behind them. The old woman was  afraid that if Gerda saw the roses she would be reminded of Kay, and  would want to run away. Then she took Gerda into the flower garden. What  a delicious scent there was! and every imaginable flower for every  season was in that lovely garden; no picture-book could be brighter or  more beautiful. Gerda jumped for joy and played till the sun went down  behind the tall cherry trees. Then she was put into a lovely bed with  rose-coloured silken coverings stuffed with violets; she slept and  dreamt as lovely dreams as any queen on her wedding day.    The next day she played with the flowers in the garden again--and many  days passed in the same way. Gerda knew every flower, but however many  there were, she always thought there was one missing, but which it was  she did not know.    One day she was sitting looking at the old woman's sun hat with its  painted flowers, and the very prettiest one of them all was a rose. The  old woman had forgotten her hat when she charmed the others away. This  is the consequence of being absent-minded.    'What!' said Gerda, 'are there no roses here?' and she sprang in among  the flower-beds and sought, but in vain! Her hot tears fell on the very  places where the roses used to be; when the warm drops moistened the  earth the rose-trees shot up again, just as full of bloom as when they  sank. Gerda embraced the roses and kissed them, and then she thought of  the lovely roses at home, and this brought the thought of little Kay.    'Oh, how I have been delayed,' said the little girl, 'I ought to have  been looking for Kay! Don't you know where he is?' she asked the roses.  'Do you think he is dead and gone?'    'He is not dead,' said the roses. 'For we have been down underground,  you know, and all the dead people are there, but Kay is not among them.'    'Oh, thank you!' said little Gerda, and then she went to the other  flowers and looked into their cups and said, 'Do you know where Kay is?'    But each flower stood in the sun and dreamt its own dreams. Little Gerda  heard many of these, but never anything about Kay.    And what said the Tiger lilies?    'Do you hear the drum? rub-a-dub, it has only two notes, rub-a-dub,  always the same. The wailing of women and the cry of the preacher. The  Hindu woman in her long red garment stands on the pile, while the flames  surround her and her dead husband. But the woman is only thinking of the  living man in the circle round, whose eyes burn with a fiercer fire than  that of the flames which consume the body. Do the flames of the heart  die in the fire?'    'I understand nothing about that,' said little Gerda.    'That is my story,' said the Tiger lily.    'What does the convolvulus say?'    'An old castle is perched high over a narrow mountain path, it is  closely covered with ivy, almost hiding the old red walls, and creeping  up leaf upon leaf right round the balcony where stands a beautiful  maiden. She bends over the balustrade and looks eagerly up the road. No  rose on its stem is fresher than she; no apple blossom wafted by the  wind moves more lightly. Her silken robes rustle softly as she bends  over and says, 'Will he never come?''    'Is it Kay you mean?' asked Gerda.    'I am only talking about my own story, my dream,' answered the  convolvulus.    What said the little snowdrop?    'Between two trees a rope with a board is hanging; it is a swing. Two  pretty little girls in snowy frocks and green ribbons fluttering on  their hats are seated on it. Their brother, who is bigger than they are,  stands up behind them; he has his arms round the ropes for supports, and  holds in one hand a little bowl and in the other a clay pipe. He is  blowing soap-bubbles. As the swing moves the bubbles fly upwards in all  their changing colours, the last one still hangs from the pipe swayed by  the wind, and the swing goes on. A little black dog runs up, he is  almost as light as the bubbles, he stands up on his hind legs and wants  to be taken into the swing, but it does not stop. The little dog falls  with an angry bark; they jeer at it; the bubble bursts. A swinging  plank, a fluttering foam picture--that is my story!'    'I daresay what you tell me is very pretty, but you speak so sadly and  you never mention little Kay.'    What says the hyacinth?    'They were three beautiful sisters, all most delicate, and quite  transparent. One wore a crimson robe, the other a blue, and the third  was pure white. These three danced hand-in-hand, by the edge of the lake  in the moonlight. They were human beings, not fairies of the wood. The  fragrant air attracted them, and they vanished into the wood; here the  fragrance was stronger still. Three coffins glide out of the wood  towards the lake, and in them lie the maidens. The fire-flies flutter  lightly round them with their little flickering torches. Do these  dancing maidens sleep, or are they dead? The scent of the flower says  that they are corpses. The evening bell tolls their knell.'    'You make me quite sad,' said little Gerda; 'your perfume is so strong  it makes me think of those dead maidens. Oh, is little Kay really dead?  The roses have been down underground, and they say no.'    'Ding, dong,' tolled the hyacinth bells; 'we are not tolling for little  Kay; we know nothing about him. We sing our song, the only one we know.'    And Gerda went on to the buttercups shining among their dark green  leaves.    'You are a bright little sun,' said Gerda. 'Tell me if you know where I  shall find my playfellow.'    The buttercup shone brightly and returned Gerda's glance. What song  could the buttercup sing? It would not be about Kay.    'God's bright sun shone into a little court on the first day of spring.  The sunbeams stole down the neighbouring white wall, close to which  bloomed the first yellow flower of the season; it shone like burnished  gold in the sun. An old woman had brought her arm-chair out into the  sun; her granddaughter, a poor and pretty little maid-servant, had come  to pay her a short visit, and she kissed her. There was gold, heart's  gold, in the kiss. Gold on the lips, gold on the ground, and gold above,  in the early morning beams! Now that is my little story,' said the  buttercup.    'Oh, my poor old grandmother!' sighed Gerda. 'She will be longing to see  me, and grieving about me, as she did about Kay. But I shall soon go  home again and take Kay with me. It is useless for me to ask the flowers  about him. They only know their own stories, and have no information to  give me.'    Then she tucked up her little dress, so that she might run the faster;  but the narcissus blossoms struck her on the legs as she jumped over  them, so she stopped and said, 'Perhaps you can tell me something.'    She stooped down close to the flower and listened. What did it say?    'I can see myself, I can see myself,' said the narcissus. 'Oh, how sweet  is my scent. Up there in an attic window stands a little dancing girl  half dressed; first she stands on one leg, then on the other, and looks  as if she would tread the whole world under her feet. She is only a  delusion. She pours some water out of a teapot on to a bit of stuff that  she is holding; it is her bodice. \"Cleanliness is a good thing,\" she  says. Her white dress hangs on a peg; it has been washed in the teapot,  too, and dried on the roof. She puts it on, and wraps a saffron-"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17866"],[0,"Murder in the Gunroom (#3)"],[1,"formation. Are you busy?... Okay, I'll be up directly.\"    He replaced the phone and turned to his disciples.    \"Our client,\" he said, \"wants two jobs done on one fee. Getting the  pistol-collection sold is one job. Exploring the whys and wherefores of  that quote accident unquote is the other. She has a hunch, and probably  nothing much better, that there's something sour about the accident. She  expects me to find evidence to that effect while I'm at Rosemont, going  over the collection. I'm not excluding other possibilities, but I'll work  on that line until and unless I find out differently. Five thousand  should cover both jobs.\"    \"You think that's how it is?\" Kathie asked.    \"Look, Kathie. I got just as far in Arithmetic, at school, as you did,  and I suspect that Mrs. Fleming got at least as far as long division,  herself. For reasons I stated, I simply couldn't have handled that  collection business for anything like a reasonable fee, so I told her  five thousand, thinking that would stop her. When it didn't, I knew she  had something else in mind, and when she went into all that detail about  the death of her husband, she as good as told me that was what it was.  Now I'm sorry I didn't say ten thousand; I think she'd have bought it at  that price just as cheerfully. She thinks Lane Fleming was murdered.  Well, on the face of what she told me, so do I.\"    \"All right, Professor; expound,\" Ritter said.    \"You heard what he was supposed to have shot himself with,\" Rand began.  \"A Colt-type percussion revolver. You know what they're like. And I know  enough about Lane Fleming to know how much experience he had with old  arms. I can't believe that he'd buy a pistol without carefully examining  it, and I can't believe that he'd bring that thing home and start working  on it without seeing the caps on the nipples and the charges in the  chambers, if it had been loaded. And if it had been, he would have first  taken off the caps, and then taken it apart and drawn the charges. And  she says he started working on it as soon as he got home--presumably  around five--and then took time out for dinner, and then went back to  work on it, and more than half an hour later, there was a shot and he was  killed.\" Rand blew a Bronx cheer. \"If that accident had been the McCoy,  it would have happened in the first five minutes after he started working  on that pistol. No, in the first thirty seconds. And then, when they  found him, he had the revolver in his right hand, and an oily rag in his  left. I hope both of you noticed that little touch.\"    \"Yeah. When I clean a gat, I generally have it in my left hand, and clean  with my right,\" Ritter said.    \"Exactly. And why do you use an oily rag?\" Rand inquired.    Ritter looked at him blankly for a half-second, then grinned ruefully.    \"Damn, I never thought of that,\" he admitted. \"Okay, he was bumped off,  all right.\"    \"But you use oily rags on guns,\" Kathie objected. \"I've seen both of you,  often enough.\"    \"When we're all through, honey,\" Ritter told her.    \"Yes. When he brought home that revolver, it was in neglected condition,\"  Rand said. \"Either surface-rusted, or filthy with gummed oil and dirt.  Even if Mrs. Fleming hadn't mentioned that point, the length of time he  spent cleaning it would justify such an inference. He would have taken it  apart, down to the smallest screw, and cleaned everything carefully, and  then put it together again, and then, when he had finished, he would have  gone over the surface with an oiled rag, before hanging it on the wall.  He would certainly not have surface-oiled it before removing the charges,  if there ever were any. I assume the revolver he was found holding,  presumably the one with which he was killed, was another one. And I would  further assume that the killer wasn't particularly familiar with the  subject of firearms, antique, care and maintenance of.\"    \"And with all the hollering and whooping and hysterics-throwing, nobody  noticed the switch,\" Ritter finished. \"Wonder what happened to the one he  was really cleaning.\"    \"That I may possibly find out,\" Rand said. \"The general incompetence with  which this murder was committed gives me plenty of room to hope that it  may still be lying around somewhere.\"    \"Well, have you thought that it might just be suicide?\" Kathie asked.    \"I have, very briefly; I dismissed the thought, almost at once,\" Rand  told her. \"For two reasons. One, that if it had been suicide, Mrs.  Fleming wouldn't want it poked into; she'd be more than willing to let it  ride as an accident. And, two, I doubt if a man who prided himself on his  gun-knowledge, as Fleming did, would want his self-shooting to be taken  for an accident. I'm damn sure I wouldn't want my friends to go around  saying: 'What a dope; didn't know it was loaded!' I doubt if he'd even  expect people to believe that it had been an accident.\" He shook his  head. \"No, the only inference I can draw is that somebody murdered  Fleming, and then faked evidence intended to indicate an accident.\" He  rose. \"I'll be back, in a little; think it over, while I'm gone.\"           *       *       *       *       *    Carter Tipton had his law-office on the floor above the Tri-State  Detective Agency. He handled all Rand's not infrequent legal  involvements, and Rand did all his investigating and witness-chasing;  annually, they compared books to see who owed whom how much. Tipton was  about five years Rand's junior, and had been in the Navy during the war.  He was frequently described as New Belfast's leading younger attorney and  most eligible bachelor. His dark, conservatively cut clothes fitted him  as though they had been sprayed on, he wore gold-rimmed glasses, and he  was so freshly barbered, manicured, valeted and scrubbed as to give the  impression that he had been born in cellophane and just unwrapped. He  leaned back in his chair and waved his visitor to a seat.    \"Tip, do you know anything about this Fleming family, out at Rosemont?\"  Rand began, getting out his pipe and tobacco.    \"The Premix-Foods Flemings?\" Tipton asked. \"Yes, a little. Which one of  them wants you to frame what on which other one?\"    \"That'll do for a good, simplified description, to start with,\" Rand  commented. \"Why, my client is Mrs. Gladys Fleming. As to what she  wants....\"    He told the young lawyer about his recent interview and subsequent  conclusions.    \"So you see,\" he finished, \"she won't commit herself, even with me. Maybe  she thinks I have more official status, and more obligations to the  police, than I have. Maybe she isn't sure in her own mind, and wants me  to see, independently, if there's any smell of something dead in the  woodpile. Or, she may think that having a private detective called in may  throw a scare into somebody. Or maybe she thinks somebody may be fixing  up an accident for her, next, and she wants a pistol-totin' gent in the  house for a while. Or any combination thereof. Personally, I deplore  these clients who hire you to do one thing and expect you to do another,  but with five grand for sweetening, I can take them.\"    \"Yes. You know, I've heard rumors of suicide, but this is the first whiff  of murder I've caught.\" He hesitated slightly. \"I must say, I'm not  greatly surprised. Lane Fleming's death was very convenient to a number  of people. You know about this Premix Company, don't you?\"    \"Vaguely. They manufacture ready-mixed pancake flour, and ready-mixed  ice-cream and pudding powders, and this dehydrated vegetable soup--pour  on hot water, stir, and serve--don't they? My colored boy, Buck, got some  of the soup, once, for an experiment. We unanimously voted not to try it  again.\"    \"They put out quite a line of such godsends to the neophyte in the  kitchen, the popularity of which is reflected in a steadily rising  divorce-rate,\" Tipton said. \"They advertise very extensively, including  half an hour of tear-jerking drama on a national hookup during soap-opera  time. Your client, the former Gladys Farrand, was on the air for Premix  for a couple of years; that's how Lane Fleming first met her.\"    \"So you think some irate and dyspeptic husband went to the source of his  woes?\" Rand inquired.    \"Well, not exactly. You see, Premix is only Little Business, as the foods  industry goes, but they have something very sweet. So sweet, in fact,  that one of the really big fellows, National Milling & Packaging, has  been going to rather extreme lengths to effect a merger. Mill-Pack, par  100, is quoted at around 145, and Premix, par 50, is at 75 now, and  Mill-Pack is offering a two-for-one-share exchange, which would be a  little less than four-for-one in value. I might add, for what it's worth,  that this Stephen Gresham you mentioned is Mill-Pack's attorney,  negotiator, and general Mr. Fixit; he has been trying to put over  this merger for Mill-Pack.\"    \"I'll bear that in mind, too,\" Rand said.    \"Naturally, all this is not being shouted from the housetops,\" Tipton  continued. \"Fact is, it's a minor infraction of ethics for me to mention  it to you.\"    \"I'll file it in the burn-box,\" Rand promised. \"What was the matter;  didn't Premix want to merge?\"    \"Lane Fleming didn't. And since he held fifty-two per cent of the common  stock himself, try and do anything about it.\"    \"Anything short of retiring Fleming to the graveyard, that is,\" Rand  amended. \"That would do for a murder-motive, very nicely.... What were  Fleming's objections to the merger?\"    \"Mainly sentimental. Premix was his baby, or, at least, his kid brother.  His father started mixing pancake flour back before the First World War,  and Lane Fleming peddled it off a spring wagon. They worked up a nice  little local trade, and finally a state-wide wholesale business. They  incorporated in the early twenties, and then, after the old man died,  Lane Fleming hired an advertising agency to promote his products, and  built up a national"]]]
