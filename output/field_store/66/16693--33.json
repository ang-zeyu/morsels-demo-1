He bargain'd with two ruffians strong,        Which were of furious mood,      That they should take the children young,        And slaye them in a wood.            [Illustration]        He told his wife an artful tale,        He would the children send      To be brought up in faire London,        With one that was his friend.            [Illustration]        Away then went those pretty babes,        Rejoycing at that tide,      Rejoycing with a merry minde,        They should on cock-horse ride.            [Illustration: AWAY THEN WENT THE PRETTY BABES           REJOYCING AT THAT TIDE]            [Illustration]        They prate and prattle pleasantly        As they rode on the waye,      To those that should their butchers be,        And work their lives' decaye:        So that the pretty speeche they had,        Made murderers' heart relent:      And they that undertooke the deed,        Full sore did now repent.        Yet one of them, more hard of heart,        Did vow to do his charge,      Because the wretch, that hired him,        Had paid him very large.            [Illustration]        The other would not agree thereto,        So here they fell to strife;      With one another they did fight,        About the children's life:            [Illustration]        And he that was of mildest mood,        Did slaye the other there,      Within an unfrequented wood,        Where babes did quake for feare            [Illustration: AND HE THAT WAS OF MILDEST MOOD,           DID SLAYE THE OTHER THERE.]            [Illustration]        He took the children by the hand,        While teares stood in their eye,      And bade them come and go with him,        And look they did not crye:        And two long miles he ledd them on,        While they for food complaine:      \"Stay here,\" quoth he, \"I'll bring ye bread,        When I come back againe.\"            [Illustration]        These prettye babes, with hand in hand,        Went wandering up and downe;            [Illustration]        But never more they sawe the man        Approaching from the town.            [Illustration]            [Illustration]        Their prettye lippes with blackberries        Were all besmear'd and dyed;      And when they sawe the darksome night,        They sat them downe and cryed.            [Illustration]        Thus wandered these two prettye babes,        Till death did end their grief;      In one another's armes they dyed,        As babes wanting relief.        No burial these prettye babes        Of any man receives,            [Illustration]        Till Robin-redbreast painfully        Did cover them with leaves.

II    _Evelyn's Childhood, Early Education, and Youth._    The essential facts of Evelyn's life, as he himself would have us know  them, are set forth at full length in autobiographical form,  chronologically arranged in what is always spoken of as his _Diary_,  although evidently this was (much of it, at any rate) merely a  subsequent personal compilation from an actual diary, kept in imitation  of his father, from the age of 11 years onwards and down even to within  one month of his death in 1706.    The second son and the fourth child of Richard Evelyn of Wotton in  Surrey, and of his wife Eleanor, daughter of John Stansfield 'of an  ancient honorable family (though now extinct) in Shropshire,' he was  born at Wotton on 31st. October, 1620. His father, 'was of a sanguine  complexion, mixed with a dash of choler; his haire inclining to light,  which tho' exceeding thick became hoary by the time he was 30 years of  age; it was somewhat curled towards the extremity; his beard, which he  wore a little picked, as the mode was, of a brownish colour, and so  continued to the last, save that it was somewhat mingled with grey  haires about his cheekes: which, with his countenance, was cleare, and  fresh colour'd, his eyes quick and piercing, an ample forehead, manly  aspect; low of stature, but very strong. He was for his life so exact  and temperate, that I have heard he had never been surprised by excesse,  being ascetic and sparing. His wisdom was greate, and judgment most  acute; of solid discourse, affable, humble and in nothing affected; of a  thriving, neat, silent and methodical genius; discretely severe, yet  liberal on all just occasions to his children, strangers, and servants;  a lover of hospitality; of a singular and Christian moderation in all  his actions; a Justice of the Peace and of the Quorum; he served his  country as High Sheriff for Surrey and Sussex together. He was a  studious decliner of honours and titles, being already in that esteem  with his country that they could have added little to him besides their  burden. He was a person of that rare conversation, that upon frequent  recollection, and calling to mind passages of his life and discourse, I  could never charge him with the least passion or inadvertence. His  estate was esteem'd about L4,000 per ann. well wooded and full of  timber.' As for his mother, 'She was of proper personage; of a brown  complexion; her eyes and haire of a lovely black; of constitution  inclyned to a religious melancholy, or pious sadnesse; of a rare memory  and most exemplary life; for oeconomie and prudence esteemed one of the  most conspicuous in her Country.'    Apparently John Evelyn thought he had made a very judicious choice of  his father and mother when he wrote 'Thus much in brief touching my  parents; nor was it reasonable I should speake lesse to them to whom I  owe so much.'    These passages, occurring in the first two pages of his _Diary_ serve at  once to illustrate a very characteristic feature of Evelyn's mind, and  one that is everywhere discernible in his writings. He was a man with a  highly cultured and a very well balanced mind, but he was somewhat  inclined to exaggerate; and he certainly had the rather enviable gift of  considering everything pertaining to him, or approved or advocated by  him, as very superior indeed. All his eggs had two yolks, and all his  geese were swans. What he liked, he _loved_; and what he did not like,  he _hated_. There was no golden mean with him; he was either very  optimistic or else intensely pessimistic. Hence, naturally, he gave hard  knocks to those who differed from him in opinion, and particularly after  the Restoration; for he was one of the most expressive among King  Charles II's courtiers. Direct evidence of this special temperament was  characteristic of Evelyn throughout all his life, and was of course  particularly noticeable in his writings, as we shall subsequently see.  It is therefore only to be expected that he prized his father's little  estate of Wotton in Surrey as one of the finest in the kingdom. 'Wotton,  the mansion house of my Father, left him by my Grandfather, (now my  eldest Brother's), is situated in the most Southern part of the Shire,  and though in a valley, yet really upon part of Lyth Hill one of the  most eminent in England for the prodigious prospect to be seen from its  summit, tho' of few observed. From it may be discerned 12 or 13  Counties, with part of the Sea on the Coast of Sussex, in a serene day.  The house is large and ancient, suitable to those hospitable times, and  so sweetly environed with those delicious streams and venerable woods,  as in the judgment of Strangers as well as Englishmen it may be compared  to one of the most tempting and pleasant Seats in the Nation, and most  tempting for a great person and a wanton purse to render it conspicuous.  It has rising grounds, meadows, woods, and water in abundance. The  distance from London (is) little more than 20 miles, and yet (it is) so  securely placed as if it were 100; three miles from Dorking, which  serves it abundantly with provisions as well of land as sea; 6 from  Guildford, 12 from Kingston. I will say nothing of the ayre, because the  praeeminence is universally given to Surrey, the soil being dry and  sandy: but I should speak much of the gardens, fountains, and groves  that adorne it, were they not as generally knowne to be amongst the most  natural, and (till this later and universal luxury of the whole nation,  since abounding in such expenses) the most magnificent that England  afforded, and which indeed gave one of the first examples to that  elegancy since so much in vogue, and followed in the managing of their  waters, and other ornaments of that nature. Let me add, the contiguity  of five or six Mannors, the patronage of the livings about it, and, what  is none of the least advantages, a good neighbourhood. All which  conspire to render it fit for the present possessor, my worthy Brother,  and his noble lady, whose constant liberality give them title both to  the place and the affections of all that know them. Thus, with the poet,        Nescio qua natale solum dulcedine cunctos      Ducit, et im' emores non sinit esse sui!'    This is a very good specimen of Evelyn's style, for it shews the  optimistic quality which, along with refinement and a love of classical  quotations, is ever present in his writings. Lythe Hill, from the summit  of which the 'prodigious prospect' is so eminently belauded, attains a  height of less than a thousand feet above the sea-level.    At the early age of four John Evelyn was initiated into the rudiments  of education by one Frier, who taught children at the church porch of  Wotton; but soon after that he was sent to Lewes in Sussex, to be with  his grandfather Standsfield, while a plague was raging in London. There  he remained, after Standsfield's death in 1627, till 1630, when he was  sent to the free school at Southover near Lewes and kept there until he  went up to Balliol College, Oxford, as a fellow-commoner in 1637, being  then 16 years of age. It was his father's intention to have placed him  at Eton 'but I was so terrefied at the report of the severe discipline  there that I was sent back to Lewes, which perverseness of mine I have  since a thousand times deplored.' In that same year (1637) Evelyn had  the misfortune to lose his mother, then only in the 37th year of her  age. Having been 'extremely remisse' in his studies at school, he made  no great mark during his University career. His application was not  assiduous, while his tutor, Bradshaw, whom he disliked, was negligent;  and he appears to have been subject to frequent attacks of ague,  disposing him to casual recreation rather than to close study. He had  also apparently the desire to acquire a smattering of many different  things rather than to study hard at a few special subjects. 'I began to  look on the rudiments of musick, in which I afterwards arriv'd to some  formal knowledge though to small perfection of hand, because I was so  frequently diverted by inclinations to newer trifles.'    Completing his Oxford studies early in 1639, without taking any degree,  he went into residence at the Middle Temple in April, and soon arrived  at the conclusion that his 'being at the University in regard of these  avocations, was of very small benefit.' Here he and his brother lodged  in 'a very handsome apartment just over against the Halt Court, but four  payre of stayres high, which gave us the advantage of fairer prospect,  but did not much contribute to the love of that unpolish'd study, to  which (I suppose,) my Father had design'd me!' While thus a law student,  on 30th October, he saw 'his Majestie (coming from his Northern  Expedition) ride in pomp, and a kind of ovation, with all the markes of  a happy peace, restor'd to the affections of his people, being  conducted through London with a most splendid cavalcade; and on 3rd  November, following (a day never to be mentioned without a curse) to  that long, ungratefull, foolish, and fatall Parliament, the beginning of  all our sorrows"]]]
