In a little while,  however, she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance  and she looked up eagerly.    [Illustration]    [Illustration]          IV--THE RABBIT SENDS IN A LITTLE BILL      It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again and looking  anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; Alice heard it  muttering to itself, \"The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh, my dear paws! Oh, my  fur and whiskers! She'll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are  ferrets! Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder?\" Alice guessed in a  moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid-gloves  and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were  nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her swim in  the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door,  had vanished completely.    Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, and called to her, in an angry tone,  \"Why, Mary Ann, what _are_ you doing out here? Run home this moment and  fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan! Quick, now!\"    \"He took me for his housemaid!\" said Alice, as she ran off. \"How  surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am!\" As she said this, she  came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass  plate with the name \"W. RABBIT\" engraved upon it. She went in without  knocking and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the  real Mary Ann and be turned out of the house before she had found the  fan and gloves.    By this time, Alice had found her way into a tidy little room with a  table in the window, and on it a fan and two or three pairs of tiny  white kid-gloves; she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves and was  just going to leave the room, when her eyes fell upon a little bottle  that stood near the looking-glass. She uncorked it and put it to her  lips, saying to herself, \"I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for,  really, I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!\"    Before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing  against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being  broken. She hastily put down the bottle, remarking, \"That's quite  enough--I hope I sha'n't grow any more.\"    Alas! It was too late to wish that! She went on growing and growing and  very soon she had to kneel down on the floor. Still she went on growing,  and, as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window and one foot  up the chimney, and said to herself, \"Now I can do no more, whatever  happens. What _will_ become of me?\"    [Illustration]    Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect  and she grew no larger. After a few minutes she heard a voice outside  and stopped to listen.    \"Mary Ann! Mary Ann!\" said the voice. \"Fetch me my gloves this moment!\"  Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was  the Rabbit coming to look for her and she trembled till she shook the  house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large  as the Rabbit and had no reason to be afraid of it.    Presently the Rabbit came up to the door and tried to open it; but as  the door opened inwards and Alice's elbow was pressed hard against it,  that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself, \"Then I'll  go 'round and get in at the window.\"    \"_That_ you won't!\" thought Alice; and after waiting till she fancied  she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her  hand and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,  but she heard a little shriek and a fall and a crash of broken glass,  from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a  cucumber-frame or something of that sort.    Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit's--\"Pat! Pat! Where are you?\" And  then a voice she had never heard before, \"Sure then, I'm here! Digging  for apples, yer honor!\"    \"Here! Come and help me out of this! Now tell me, Pat, what's that in  the window?\"    \"Sure, it's an arm, yer honor!\"    \"Well, it's got no business there, at any rate; go and take it away!\"    There was a long silence after this and Alice could only hear whispers  now and then, and at last she spread out her hand again and made another  snatch in the air. This time there were _two_ little shrieks and more  sounds of broken glass. \"I wonder what they'll do next!\" thought Alice.  \"As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they _could_!\"    She waited for some time without hearing anything more. At last came a  rumbling of little cart-wheels and the sound of a good many voices all  talking together. She made out the words: \"Where's the other ladder?  Bill's got the other--Bill! Here, Bill! Will the roof bear?--Who's to go  down the chimney?--Nay, _I_ sha'n't! _You_ do it! Here, Bill! The master  says you've got to go down the chimney!\"    Alice drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could and waited till  she heard a little animal scratching and scrambling about in the chimney  close above her; then she gave one sharp kick and waited to see what  would happen next.    The first thing she heard was a general chorus of \"There goes Bill!\"  then the Rabbit's voice alone--\"Catch him, you by the hedge!\" Then  silence and then another confusion of voices--\"Hold up his head--Brandy  now--Don't choke him--What happened to you?\"    Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, \"Well, I hardly know--No  more, thank ye. I'm better now--all I know is, something comes at me  like a Jack-in-the-box and up I goes like a sky-rocket!\"    After a minute or two of silence, they began moving about again, and  Alice heard the Rabbit say, \"A barrowful will do, to begin with.\"    \"A barrowful of _what_?\" thought Alice. But she had not long to doubt,  for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the  window and some of them hit her in the face. Alice noticed, with some  surprise, that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they  lay on the floor and a bright idea came into her head. \"If I eat one of  these cakes,\" she thought, \"it's sure to make _some_ change in my size.\"    So she swallowed one of the cakes and was delighted to find that she  began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through  the door, she ran out of the house and found quite a crowd of little  animals and birds waiting outside. They all made a rush at Alice the  moment she appeared, but she ran off as hard as she could and soon found  herself safe in a thick wood.    [Illustration: \"The Duchess tucked her arm affectionately into  Alice's.\"]    \"The first thing I've got to do,\" said Alice to herself, as she  wandered about in the wood, \"is to grow to my right size again; and the  second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I suppose I  ought to eat or drink something or other, but the great question is  'What?'\"    Alice looked all around her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but  she could not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or  drink under the circumstances. There was a large mushroom growing near  her, about the same height as herself. She stretched herself up on  tiptoe and peeped over the edge and her eyes immediately met those of a  large blue caterpillar, that was sitting on the top, with its arms  folded, quietly smoking a long hookah and taking not the smallest notice  of her or of anything else.    [Illustration]          V--ADVICE FROM A CATERPILLAR      At last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and addressed  Alice in a languid, sleepy voice.    \"Who are _you_?\" said the Caterpillar.    [Illustration]    Alice replied, rather shyly, \"I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--at  least I know who I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think I must  have changed several times since then.\"    \"What do you mean by that?\" said the Caterpillar, sternly. \"Explain  yourself!\"    \"I can't explain _myself_, I'm afraid, sir,\" said Alice, \"because I'm  not myself, you see--being so many different sizes in a day is very  confusing.\" She drew herself up and said very gravely, \"I think you  ought to tell me who _you_ are, first.\"    \"Why?\" said the Caterpillar.    As Alice could not think of any good reason and the Caterpillar seemed  to be in a _very_ unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.    \"Come back!\" the Caterpillar called after her. \"I've something important  to say!\" Alice turned and came back again.    \"Keep your temper,\" said the Caterpillar.    \"Is that all?\" said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she  could.    \"No,\" said the Caterpillar.    It unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said,  \"So you think you're changed, do you?\"    \"I'm afraid, I am, sir,\" said Alice. \"I can't remember things as I  used--and I don't keep the same size for ten minutes together!\"    \"What size do you want to be?\" asked the Caterpillar.    \"Oh, I'm not particular as to size,\" Alice hastily replied, \"only one  doesn't like changing so often, you know. I should like to be a _little_  larger, sir, if you wouldn't mind,\" said Alice. \"Three inches is such a  wretched height to be.\"    \"It is a very good height indeed!\" said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing  itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).    In a minute or two, the Caterpillar got down off the mushroom and  crawled away into the grass, merely remarking, as it went, \"One side  will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow  shorter.\"    \"One side of _what_? The other side of _what_?\" thought Alice to  herself.    \"Of the mushroom,\" said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it  aloud; and in another moment, it was out of sight.    Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying  to make out "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19036"],[0,"Germany and the Germans from an American Point of View (#3)"],[1,"y; in the other the president, or constitutional king, is the  executive servant of independent citizens, to whom he owes as much  allegiance as they owe to him.    In Saxony, to-day, more than ninety per cent. of the agricultural  population are independent peasant proprietors, and the most admirable  and successful agriculturists in the world. It is said indeed that the  Curia Regis, which is the Latinized form of the Witenagemote, or  assembly of wise men, of the Norman and Angevin kings, is the  foundation of the common law of England, and the common law of England  is the law of more than half of the civilized world.    Whatever the varieties and distinctions of government anywhere in the  world, these two differences are the fundamental and basic  differences, upon which all forms of government have been built up and  developed.    In the one, everything so far as possible is begun and carried on by  individual initiative; in the other the state gradually takes control  of all enterprise. The philosophy of the one is based upon the saying:  love one another; the political philosophy of the other is based upon  the assumption that men are not brethren, but beasts and mechanical  toys, who can only be governed by legislation and the police. The  ideal of the one is the good Samaritan, the ideal of the other is the  tax-collector. The one depends upon the wine and oil of sympathy and  human brotherhood; the other claims that the right to an iron bed in a  hospital, and the services of a state-paid and indifferent physician,  are \"refreshing fruit,\" as though sympathy and consideration, which  are what our weaker brethren most need, could be distilled from taxes!    It is claimed for these Teutonic tribes, that those of them which  drifted down from the Scandinavian peninsula, are the blood and moral  ancestors of the particularist nations now in the ascendant in the  world. The love of independent self-government, born of the  geographical necessities of the situation, stamped itself upon these  people so indelibly, that Englishmen and Americans bear the seal to  this day. This change from the patriarchal to the particularist family  took place in this German race, and took place not in those who came  from the Baltic plain, but in those who came from the Saxon plain.    The tribes from the Baltic plain, the Goths, for example, merely  overran the Roman civilization, spread over it; drowned it in superior  numbers, and with superior valor; but it was the Germans from the  Scandinavian peninsula who conquered Rome, and conquered her not by  force alone, but by offering to the world a superior social and  political organization. It was to this branch of the German race that  Varus lost his legions, at the place where the Ems has its source, at  the foot of the Teutoburger Wald. Charlemagne was of these, and his  name Karl, or Kerl, or peasant, and the fact that his title is the  only one in the world compounded of greatness and the people in equal  measure, is the pith of what the Germans brought to leaven the whole  political world. He made the common man so great, that the world has  consented to his unique and superlative baptismal title of Karl the  Great, or Carolus Magnus, or Charlemagne.    The pivotal fact to be remembered is that these German tribes saved  Europe by their love of liberty, and by their virility, from the  decadence of an orientalized Rome. Rome, and all Rome meant, was not  destroyed by these ancestors of ours; on the contrary, they saved what  was best worth saving from the decline and fall of Rome, and made out  of it with their own vigorous laws a new world, the modern western  world. Great Britain, Germany, and the United States are not descended  from Egypt, Greece, or Rome, but from \"those barbarians who issued  from the woods of Germany.\"    Every school-boy should be taught that Rome died of a disease  contracted from contact with the Oriental, the Syrian, the Jew, the  Greek, the riffraff of the eastern and southern shores of the  Mediterranean; who, by the way, make up the bulk of the immigration  into America at this time. Rome was an incurable invalid long before  the Germans took control of the western world and saved it.    When the Roman Emperor Augustus died, in 14 A. D., to be succeeded by  Tiberius, the Roman Empire was bounded on the north and east by the  Rhine, the Danube, the Black Sea and its southern territory, and  Syria; by all the known country from the Red Sea to the Atlantic Ocean  in northern Africa on the south; and by the Atlantic Ocean as far  north as the river Elbe on the west. Five hundred years later, about  500 A. D., the Barbarians, as they were called, had thrust aside the  Roman Empire. The Saxons controlled the southern and eastern coasts of  England; the Franks were rulers in the whole country from the Loire to  the Elbe; south of them the Visigoths ruled Spain; Italy and all the  country to the north and east of the Adriatic, as far as the Danube,  were in the hands of the Ostrogoths. The Roman Empire had been pushed  to the eastern end of the Mediterranean, with its capital at  Constantinople.    In another three hundred years, or in 800 A. D., the king of one of  these German tribes revived the title of Roman Emperor, was crowned by  the Pope, Leo III, and governed Europe as Charlemagne. His banner with  the double-headed eagle, representing the two empires of Germany and  Rome, is the standard of Germany to-day. Charles Martel, who led the  West against the East, defeating the Arabs in the country between what  is now Tours and Poitiers, was Charlemagne's grandfather. What is now  western Europe, became the home and the consolidated kingdom of the  German tribes who had drifted down from the west of the Baltic, and  into the Saxon plain. They had become masters in this territory: after  victories over the Mongolian tribes, and the Huns under Attila, who  had conquered and plundered as far as Strasburg, Worms, and Treves,  and were finally defeated near what is now Chalons; after driving off  the Arabs under Charles the Hammer (732); after imposing their rule  upon the Roman Empire, the remains of which cowered in Constantinople,  where the Ottoman Turk took even that from it in 1453, which date may  well be taken as marking the beginning of modern history, and became  themselves thereafter one of the first powers in Christian Europe; a  power which is now, in 1912, the quarrel ground of the Western powers.    These are Brobdingnagian strides through history, to reach the days of  Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio, Chaucer, Froissart, and the first  translation of the Bible into a vulgar tongue by Wickliffe, to the  days when Lorenzo de Medici breathed Greece into Europe, and the  feeling for beauty changed from invalidism to convalescence; to the  days when cannon were first used, printing invented, America  discovered, and the man Luther, who gave the Germans their present  language by his translation of the Bible, and who delivered us from  papal tyranny, born; and Agincourt, and Joan of Arc, are picturesque  and poignant features of the historical landscape.    These rude German tribes had been welded by hardship and warfare, into  compact and self-governing bodies. These loosely bound masses of men,  women, and children, straggling down to find room and food, are now,  in 1400 A. D., France, England, Austria, Germany, Scotland, and Spain.  The same spirit and vigor that roamed the coasts all the way from  Sweden and Norway to the mouth of the Thames, and to the Rhine, the  Seine, and to the Straits of Gibraltar, are abroad again, landing on  the shores of America, circumnavigating Africa, and bringing home  tales of Indians in the west, and Indians in the east. This virile  stock that had been hammered and hewn was now to be polished; and in  Italy, France, England, and Germany grew up a passion for translating  the rough mythology, and the fierce fancy of the north, into painting,  building, poetry, and music.    France, Germany, England, Spain, Holland, Belgium, Italy, too, grew  out of these German tribes, who poured down from the territory roughly  included between the Rhine, the North Sea, the Oder, and the Danube.    As we know these countries to-day, the definite thing about them is  their difference. You cross the channel in fifty minutes from Dover to  Calais, you cross the Rhine in five minutes, and the peoples seem  thousands of miles apart. \"How did it happen,\" asks Voltaire, \"that,  setting out from the same point of departure, the governments of  England and of France arrived at nearly the same time, at results as  dissimilar as the constitution of Venice is unlike that of Morocco?\"    One might ask as well how it happened, that the speech of one German  invasion mixing itself with Latin became French, of another Spanish,  of another Portuguese, of another Italian, of another English. These  are interesting inquiries, and in regard to the former it is not  difficult to see, that men grew to be governed differently, according  as the geographical exigencies of their homes were different, and as  they occupied themselves differently.    The observant traveller in the United States, may see for himself what  differences even a few years of differing climate, and circumstances,  and custom will produce. The inhabitants of Charleston, South  Carolina, are evidently and visibly different from those in Davenport,  Iowa. Two towns of similar size and wealth, Salisbury, Maryland, and  Hingham, Massachusetts, are almost as different, except in speech, and  even in speech the accent is perceptibly different even to the  careless listener, as though Salisbury were in the south of France,  and Hingham in the north of Germany. These changes and differences are  only inexplicable, to those who will not see the ethnographical  miracles taking place under their noses. Look at the mongrel crowd on  Fifth Avenue at midday, and remember what was "]]]
