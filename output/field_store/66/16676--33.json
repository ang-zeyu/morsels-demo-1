The house is uninhabited, and perhaps  uninhabitable--indeed almost a ruin--and is used as a storeroom for wood  and rubbish by the peasants in the adjoining house to the left, on the  south.    The ground in front was cultivated with vegetables, not laid down to a  lawn, and the land stretched back for perhaps three hundred to four  hundred feet between the old garden walls.    Here, amid these rural scenes, even now so beautiful and tranquil, the  subject of our sketch was born and lived through his infancy and early  boyhood.[1]    If his parents did not possess an ample fortune, they were blessed with  a numerous progeny, for Lamarck was the eleventh and youngest child, and  seems to have survived all the others. Biographers have differed as to  the date of the birth of Lamarck.[2] Happily the exact date had been  ascertained through the researches of M. Philippe Salmon; and M. Duval  kindly showed us in the thin volume of records, with its tattered and  torn leaves, the register of the _Acte de Naissance_, and made a copy of  it, as follows:      _Extrait du Registre aux Actes de Bapteme de la Commune de Bazentin,    pour l'Annee 1744._      L'an mil sept cent quarante-quatre, le premier aout est ne en    legitime mariage et le lendemain a ete baptise par moy cure    soussigne Jean Baptiste Pierre Antoine, fils de Messire Jacques    Philippe de Monet, chevalier de Lamarck, seigneur des Bazentin grand    et petit et de haute et puissante Dame Marie Francoise de Fontaine    demeurant en leur chateau de Bazentin le petit, son parrain a ete    Messire Jean Baptiste de Fosse, pretre-chanoine de l'eglise    collegiale de St. Farcy de Peronne, y demeurant, sa marraine Dame    Antoinette Francoise de Bucy, niece de Messire Louis Joseph    Michelet, chevalier, ancien commissaire de l'artillerie de France    demeurante au chateau de Guillemont, qui ont signe avec mon dit    sieur de Bazentin et nous.      Ont signe: De Fosse, De Bucy Michelet, Bazentin. Cozette, cure.    [Illustration: ACT OF BIRTH]    Of Lamarck's parentage and ancestry there are fortunately some traces.  In the _Registre aux Actes de Bapteme pour l'Annee 1702_, still  preserved in the _mairie_ of Bazentin-le-Petit, the record shows that  his father was born in February, 1702, at Bazentin. The infant was  baptised February 16, 1702, the permission to the _cure_ by Henry,  Bishop of Amiens, having been signed February 3, 1702. Lamarck's  grandparents were, according to this certificate of baptism, Messire  Philippe de Monet de Lamarck, Ecuyer, Seigneur des Bazentin, and Dame  Magdeleine de Lyonne.    The family of Lamarck, as stated by H. Masson,[3] notwithstanding his  northern and almost Germanic name of Chevalier de Lamarck, originated in  the southwest of France. Though born at Bazentin, in old Picardy, it is  not less true that he descended on the paternal side from an ancient  house of Bearn, whose patrimony was very modest. This house was that of  Monet.    Another genealogist, Baron C. de Cauna,[4] tells us that there is no  doubt that the family of Monet in Bigorre[5] was divided. One of its  representatives formed a branch in Picardy in the reign of Louis XIV.  or later.    Lamarck's grandfather, Philippe de Monet, \"seigneur de Bazentin et  autres lieux,\" was also \"chevalier de l'ordre royal et militaire de  Saint-Louis, commandant pour le roi en la ville et chateau de Dinan,  pensionnaire de sa majeste.\"    The descendants of Philippe de Lamarck were, adds de Cauna, thus thrown  into two branches, or at least two offshoots or stems (_brisures_), near  Peronne. But the actual posterity of the Monet of Picardy was reduced to  a single family, claiming back, with good reason, to a southern origin.  One of its scions in the maternal line was a brilliant officer of the  military marine and also son-in-law of a very distinguished naval  officer.    The family of Monet was represented among the French nobility of 1789 by  Messires de Monet de Caixon and de Monet de Saint-Martin. By marriage  their grandson was connected with an honorable family of Montant, near  Saint-Sever-Cap.    Another authority, the Abbe J. Dulac, has thrown additional light on the  genealogy of the de Lamarck family, which, it may be seen, was for at  least three centuries a military one.[6] The family of Monet, Seigneur  de Saint-Martin et de Sombran, was maintained as a noble one by order of  the Royal Council of State of June 20, 1678. He descended (I) from  Bernard de Monet, esquire, captain of the chateau of Lourdes, who had as  a son (II) Etienne de Monet, esquire, who, by contract dated August 15,  1543, married Marguerite de Sacaze. He was the father of (III) Pierre  de Monet, esquire, \"Seigneur d'Ast, en Bearn, guidon des gendarmes de la  compagnie du roi de Navarre.\" From him descended (IV) Etienne de Monet,  esquire, second of the name, \"Seigneur d'Ast et Lamarque, de Julos.\" He  was a captain by rank, and bought the estate of Saint-Martin in 1592. He  married, in 1612, Jeanne de Lamarque, daughter of William de Lamarck,  \"Seigneur de Lamarque et de Bretaigne.\" They had three children, the  third of whom was Philippe, \"chevalier de Saint-Louis, commandant du  chateau de Dinan, Seigneur de Bazentin, en Picardy,\" who, as we have  already seen, was the father of the naturalist Lamarck, who lived from  1744 to 1829. The abbe relates that Philippe, the father of the  naturalist, was born at Saint-Martin, in the midst of Bigorre, \"_in  pleine Bigorre_,\" and he very neatly adds that \"the Bigorrais have the  right to claim for their land of flowers one of the glories of  botany.\"[7]    The name was at first variously spelled de Lamarque, de la Marck, or  de Lamarck. He himself signed his name, when acting as secretary of the  Assembly of Professors-administrative of the Museum of Natural History  during the years of the First Republic, as plain Lamarck.    The inquiry arises how, being the eleventh child, he acquired the title  of chevalier, which would naturally have become extinct with the death  of the oldest son. The Abbe Dulac suggests that the ten older of the  children had died, or that by some family arrangement he was allowed to  add the domanial name to the patronymic one. Certainly he never  tarnished the family name, which, had it not been for him, would have  remained in obscurity.    As to his father's tastes and disposition, what influence his mother had  in shaping his character, his home environment, as the youngest of  eleven children, the nature of his education in infancy and boyhood,  there are no sources of information. But several of his brothers entered  the army, and the domestic atmosphere was apparently a military one.    Philippe de Lamarck, with his large family, had endowed his first-born  son so that he could maintain the family name and title, and had found  situations for several of the others in the army. Jean Lamarck did not  manifest any taste for the clerical profession. He lived in a martial  atmosphere. For centuries his ancestors had borne arms. His eldest  brother had been killed in the breach at the siege of Berg-op-Zoom; two  others were still in the service, and in the troublous times at the  beginning of the war in 1756, a young man of high spirit and courage  would naturally not like to relinquish the prospect of renown and  promotion. But, yielding to the wishes of his father, he entered as a  student at the college of the Jesuits at Amiens.[8]    His father dying in 1760, nothing could induce the incipient abbe, then  seventeen years of age, to longer wear his bands. Immediately on  returning home he bought himself a wretched horse, for want of means to  buy a better one, and, accompanied by a poor lad of his village, he  rode across the country to join the French army, then campaigning in  Germany.

Paris le 5 pluviose an dix    Lamarck]    He carried with him a letter of recommendation from one of his neighbors  on an adjoining estate in the country, Madame de Lameth, to M.  de Lastic, colonel of the regiment of Beaujolais.[9]      \"We can imagine [says Cuvier] the feelings of this officer on thus    finding himself hampered with a boy whose puny appearance made him    seem still younger than he was. However, he sent him to his    quarters, and then busied himself with his duties. The period indeed    was a critical one. It was the 16th of July, 1761. The Marshal    de Broglie had just united his army with that of the Prince    de Soubise, and the next day was to attack the allied army commanded    by the Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick. At the break of day M.    de Lastic rode along the front of his corps, and the first man that    met his gaze was the new recruit, who, without saying anything to    him, had placed himself in the front rank of a company of    grenadiers, and nothing could induce him to quit his post.      \"It is a matter of history that this battle, which bears the name of    the little village of Fissingshausen, between Ham and Lippstadt, in    Westphalia, was lost by the French, and that the two generals,    mutually accusing each other of this defeat, immediately separated,    and abandoned the campaign.      \"During the movement of the battle, de Lamarck's company was    stationed in a position exposed to the direct fire of the enemy's    artillery. In the confusion of the retreat he was forgotten. Already    all the officers and non-commissioned officers had been killed;    there remained only fourteen men, when the oldest grenadier, seeing    that there were no more of the French troops in sight, proposed to    the young volunteer, become so promptly commander, to withdraw his    little troop.

The other wagons were brought across without mishap; but the dogs did  not come with them. Jones called and called. The dogs howled and  howled. Finally I waded out over the wet bars and little streams to a  point several hundred yards nearer the dogs. Moze was lying down, but  the others were whining and howling in a state of great perturbation. I  called and called. They answered, and even ran into the water, but did  not start across.    \"Hyah, Moze! hyah, you Indian!\" I yelled, losing my patience. \"You've  already swum the Big Colorado, and this is only a brook. Come on!\"    This appeal evidently touched Moze, for he barked, and plunged in. He  made the water fly, and when carried off his feet, breasted the current  with energy and power. He made shore almost even with me, and wagged  his tail. Not to be outdone, Jude, Tige and Don followed suit, and  first one and then another was swept off his feet and carried  downstream. They landed below me. This left Ranger, the pup, alone on  the other shore. Of all the pitiful yelps ever uttered by a frightened  and lonely puppy, his were the most forlorn I had ever heard. Time  after time he plunged in, and with many bitter howls of distress, went  back. I kept calling, and at last, hoping to make him come by a show of  indifference, I started away. This broke his heart. Putting up his  head, he let out a long, melancholy wail, which for aught I knew might  have been a prayer, and then consigned himself to the yellow current.  Ranger swam like a boy learning. He seemed to be afraid to get wet. His  forefeet were continually pawing the air in front of his nose. When he  struck the swift place, he went downstream like a flash, but still kept  swimming valiantly. I tried to follow along the sand-bar, but found it  impossible. I encouraged him by yelling. He drifted far below, stranded  on an island, crossed it, and plunged in again, to make shore almost  out of my sight. And when at last I got to dry sand, there was Ranger,  wet and disheveled, but consciously proud and happy.    After lunch we entered upon the seventy-mile stretch from the Little to  the Big Colorado.    Imagination had pictured the desert for me as a vast, sandy plain, flat  and monotonous. Reality showed me desolate mountains gleaming bare in  the sun, long lines of red bluffs, white sand dunes, and hills of blue  clay, areas of level ground--in all, a many-hued, boundless world in  itself, wonderful and beautiful, fading all around into the purple haze  of deceiving distance.    Thin, clear, sweet, dry, the desert air carried a languor, a  dreaminess, tidings of far-off things, and an enthralling promise. The  fragrance of flowers, the beauty and grace of women, the sweetness of  music, the mystery of life--all seemed to float on that promise. It was  the air breathed by the lotus-eaters, when they dreamed, and wandered  no more.    Beyond the Little Colorado, we began to climb again. The sand was  thick; the horses labored; the drivers shielded their faces. The dogs  began to limp and lag. Ranger had to be taken into a wagon; and then,  one by one, all of the other dogs except Moze. He refused to ride, and  trotted along with his head down.    Far to the front the pink cliffs, the ragged mesas, the dark, volcanic  spurs of the Big Colorado stood up and beckoned us onward. But they  were a far hundred miles across the shifting sands, and baked day, and  ragged rocks. Always in the rear rose the San Francisco peaks, cold and  pure, startlingly clear and close in the rare atmosphere.    We camped near another water hole, located in a deep, yellow-colored  gorge, crumbling to pieces, a ruin of rock, and silent as the grave. In  the bottom of the canyon was a pool of water, covered with green scum.  My thirst was effectually quenched by the mere sight of it. I slept  poorly, and lay for hours watching the great stars. The silence was  painfully oppressive. If Jones had not begun to give a respectable  imitation of the exhaust pipe on a steamboat, I should have been  compelled to shout aloud, or get up; but this snoring would have  dispelled anything. The morning came gray and cheerless. I got up stiff  and sore, with a tongue like a rope.    All day long we ran the gauntlet of the hot, flying sand. Night came  again, a cold, windy night. I slept well until a mule stepped on my  bed, which was conducive to restlessness. At dawn, cold, gray clouds  tried to blot out the rosy east. I could hardly get up. My lips were  cracked; my tongue swollen to twice its natural size; my eyes smarted  and burned. The barrels and kegs of water were exhausted. Holes that  had been dug in the dry sand of a dry streambed the night before in the  morning yielded a scant supply of muddy alkali water, which went to the  horses.    Only twice that day did I rouse to anything resembling enthusiasm. We  came to a stretch of country showing the wonderful diversity of the  desert land. A long range of beautifully rounded clay stones bordered  the trail. So symmetrical were they that I imagined them works of  sculptors. Light blue, dark blue, clay blue, marine blue, cobalt  blue--every shade of blue was there, but no other color. The other time  that I awoke to sensations from without was when we came to the top of  a ridge. We had been passing through red-lands. Jones called the place  a strong, specific word which really was illustrative of the heat amid  those scaling red ridges. We came out where the red changed abruptly to  gray. I seemed always to see things first, and I cried out: \"Look! here  are a red lake and trees!\"    \"No, lad, not a lake,\" said old Jim, smiling at me; \"that's what haunts  the desert traveler. It's only mirage!\"    So I awoke to the realization of that illusive thing, the mirage, a  beautiful lie, false as stairs of sand. Far northward a clear rippling  lake sparkled in the sunshine. Tall, stately trees, with waving green  foliage, bordered the water. For a long moment it lay there, smiling in  the sun, a thing almost tangible; and then it faded. I felt a sense of  actual loss. So real had been the illusion that I could not believe I  was not soon to drink and wade and dabble in the cool waters.  Disappointment was keen. This is what maddens the prospector or  sheep-herder lost in the desert. Was it not a terrible thing to be  dying of thirst, to see sparkling water, almost to smell it and then  realize suddenly that all was only a lying track of the desert, a lure,  a delusion? I ceased to wonder at the Mormons, and their search for  water, their talk of water. But I had not realized its true  significance. I had not known what water was. I had never appreciated  it. So it was my destiny to learn that water is the greatest thing on  earth. I hung over a three-foot hole in a dry stream-bed, and watched  it ooze and seep through the sand, and fill up--oh, so slowly; and I  felt it loosen my parched tongue, and steal through all my dry body  with strength and life. Water is said to constitute three fourths of  the universe. However that may be, on the desert it is the whole world,  and all of life.    Two days passed by, all hot sand and wind and glare. The Mormons sang  no more at evening; Jones was silent; the dogs were limp as rags.    At Moncaupie Wash we ran into a sandstorm. The horses turned their  backs to it, and bowed their heads patiently. The Mormons covered  themselves. I wrapped a blanket round my head and hid behind a sage  bush. The wind, carrying the sand, made a strange hollow roar. All was  enveloped in a weird yellow opacity. The sand seeped through the sage  bush and swept by with a soft, rustling sound, not unlike the wind in  the rye. From time to time I raised a corner of my blanket and peeped  out. Where my feet had stretched was an enormous mound of sand. I felt  the blanket, weighted down, slowly settle over me.    Suddenly as it had come, the sandstorm passed. It left a changed world  for us. The trail was covered; the wheels hub-deep in sand; the horses,  walking sand dunes. I could not close my teeth without grating harshly  on sand.    We journeyed onward, and passed long lines of petrified trees, some a  hundred feet in length, lying as they had fallen, thousands of years  before. White ants crawled among the ruins. Slowly climbing the sandy  trail, we circled a great red bluff with jagged peaks, that had seemed  an interminable obstacle. A scant growth of cedar and sage again made  its appearance. Here we halted to pass another night. Under a cedar I  heard the plaintive, piteous bleat of an animal. I searched, and  presently found a little black and white lamb, scarcely able to stand.  It came readily to me, and I carried it to the wagon.    \"That's a Navajo lamb,\" said Emmett. \"It's lost. There are Navajo  Indians close by.\"    \"Away in the desert we heard its cry,\" quoted one of the Mormons.    Jones and I climbed the red mesa near camp to see the sunset. All the  western world was ablaze in golden glory. Shafts of light shot toward  the zenith, and bands of paler gold, tinging to rose, circled away from  the fiery, sinking globe. Suddenly the sun sank, the gold changed to  gray, then to purple, and shadows formed in the deep gorge at our feet.  So sudden was the transformation that soon it was night, the solemn,  impressive night of the desert. A stillness that seemed too sacred to  break clasped the place; it was infinite; it held the bygone ages, and  eternity.    More days, and miles, miles, miles! The last day's ride to the Big  Colorado was unforgettable. We rode toward the head of a gigantic red  cliff pocket, a veritable inferno, immeasurably hot, glaring, awful. It  towered higher and higher above us. When we reached a point of this red  barrier, we heard the dull rumbling roar of water, and we came out, at  length, on a winding trail cut in the face of a blue"]]]
