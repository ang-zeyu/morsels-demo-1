The Committee would like to express their thanks to the witnesses, many  of whom went to considerable trouble to collect information and prepare  evidence. They are especially grateful to the British Medical  Association for its willing co-operation and assistance; to the large  number of members of the medical profession throughout the Dominion who  responded to the Committee's request for information; to the authorities  overseas for their response to requests for information; and to many  other persons who by means of correspondence and literature have placed  at the Committee's disposal a large amount of information which has been  of material assistance in the investigation; also to the various  Hospital Boards throughout the Dominion who so willingly placed their  Boardrooms at the disposal of the Committee.    Sir George Newman, the Chief Medical Officer of the Board of Education  and the Ministry of Health, England, very courteously supplied the  Committee with a valuable memorandum on the care of mental defectives in  England and Wales, while the Secretary of State for the United States,  through the good offices of the American Consul-General, Mr. Edwin N.  Gunsaulus, kindly forwarded information supplied by the United States  Public Health Service regarding the legislation and regulations in force  in various States where sterilization for eugenical purposes has been  legalized.    Information of great value and interest has also been received from Dr.  E. S. Morris, Director of Health, Tasmania; from Dr. Helen MacMurchy,  Department of Health, Ottawa; and from Dr. Eric Clarke, Toronto,  Assistant Medical Director, Canadian National Conference for Mental  Hygiene.    The Committee further wish to make special mention of the services  rendered by the Secretary, Mr. J. W. Buchanan, whose work has been very  heavy owing to the number of witnesses examined and the extent of ground  covered in a comparatively short time. This would not have been possible  but for the complete arrangements made by Mr. Buchanan, and the ability  and energy which he showed generally in the discharge of his duties left  nothing to be desired.      SECTION 2.--TWO DISTINCT QUESTIONS.    Before proceeding to the subject-matter of the Committee's  investigations and the conclusions arrived at it is necessary to point  out as clearly and emphatically as possible that the questions submitted  to the Committee were entirely separate and distinct from each other. It  is true that a certain proportion of mental defectives show their lack  of self-control in regard to sex instincts and functions as in other  respects. This is particularly the case with mentally defective girls,  and constitutes one of the chief difficulties in dealing with them  satisfactorily. Some of this class find their way into prison on account  of sexual offences, but it is very far from correct to suppose that all  feeble-minded persons are sexual offenders, or that all sexual offenders  are mentally defective. On the contrary, among sexual offenders of the  worst type, those convicted of unnatural offences, are occasionally  found to be persons possessing intellectual and artistic powers above  the average. There is something wrong in their mental, moral, and  emotional balance, as will be pointed out in the proper place, but, as a  rule, it is not the \"intelligence quotient\" which is at fault.          PART II.--PROBLEM OF THE FEEBLE-MINDED.      SECTION 1.--A MENACE TO MODERN CIVILIZATION.    The Committee are of opinion that the unrestricted multiplication of  feeble-minded members of the community is a most serious menace to the  future welfare and happiness of the Dominion, and it is of the utmost  importance that some means of meeting the peril should be adopted  without delay. The position is the more serious because, while the  feeble-minded are extraordinarily prolific, there is a growing tendency  among the more intellectual classes for the birth-rate to become  restricted.    An American writer, Lothrop Stoddart, in his striking book entitled  \"Revolt against Civilization,\" expresses the fear that the very  foundations of civilization are being undermined. He finds reasons for  great pessimism as regards the future in the results of the intelligence  tests taken in the American Army during the war.    The American War Department made psychological tests of 1,700,000  officers and men, who were graded as follows:--      Grade.    Percentage.    Mental Age.      A            41/2            18-19    Very superior intelligence.    B            9             16-17    Superior intelligence.    C1          161/2             15      Average intelligence. (Rarely capable                                        of finishing high-school course.)    C--         25             13-14    Low average intelligence.    D           15              11      Inferior intelligence.    D--         10              10      Very inferior intelligence.    Assuming that these 1,700,000 men are a fair sample of the entire  population of 100,000,000 (and Stoddart says there is every reason to  believe that it is a fair sample), this means that the average mental  age of Americans is only about fourteen; "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18937"],[0,"My First Picture Book (#3)"],[1," HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK.      [Illustration: Mother Goose and family.]    Old Mother Goose lived in a cottage with her son Jack. Jack was a  very good lad, and although he was not handsome, he was good-tempered  and industrious, and this made him better-looking than half the other  boys. Old Mother Goose carried a long stick, she wore a high-crowned  hat, and high-heeled shoes, and her kerchief was as white as snow.  Then there was the Gander that swam in the pond, and the Owl that sat  on the wall. So you see they formed a very happy family. But what a  fine strong fellow the Gander was! Whenever Old Mother Goose wanted  to take a journey, she would mount upon his broad strong back, and  away he would fly and carry her swiftly to any distance.    [Illustration: Mother Goose and Gander flying.]    Now Old Mother Goose thought her Gander often looked sad and lonely;  so one day she sent Jack to market to buy the finest Goose he could  find. It was early in the morning when he started, and his way lay  through a wood. He was not afraid of robbers; so on he went, with his  Mother's great clothes-prop over his shoulder. The fresh morning air  caused Jack's spirits to rise. He left the road, and plunged into the  thick of the wood, where he amused himself by leaping with his  clothes-prop till he found he had lost himself. After he had made  many attempts to find the path again, he heard a scream. He jumped up  and ran boldly towards the spot from which the sound came. Through an  opening in the trees he saw a young lady trying to get away from a  ruffian who wanted to steal her mantle. With one heavy blow of his  staff Jack sent the thief howling away, and then went back to the  young lady, who was lying on the ground, crying.    [Illustration: Jack and young lady.]    She soon dried her tears when she found that the robber had made off,  and thanked Jack for his help. The young lady told Jack that she was  the daughter of the Squire, who lived in the great white house on the  hill-top. She knew the path out of the wood quite well, and when they  reached the border, she said that Jack must come soon to her father's  house, so that he might thank him for his noble conduct.    When Jack was left alone, he made the best of his way to the  market-place. He found little trouble in picking out the best Goose,  for when he got there he was very late, and there was but one left.  But as it was a prime one, Jack bought it at once, and keeping to the  road, made straight for home. At first the Goose objected to be  carried; and then, when she had walked along slowly and gravely for a  short time, she tried to fly away; so Jack seized her in his arms and  kept her there till he reached home.    [Illustration: Jack carrying Goose.]    Old Mother Goose was greatly pleased when she saw what a fine bird  Jack had bought; and the Gander showed more joy than I can describe.  And then they all lived very happily for a long time. But Jack would  often leave off work to dream of the lovely young lady whom he had  rescued in the forest, and soon began to sigh all day long. He  neglected the garden, cared no more for the Gander, and scarcely even  noticed the beautiful Goose. But one morning, as he was walking by  the pond, he saw both the Goose and the Gander making a great noise,  as though they were in the utmost glee. He went up to them and was  surprised to find on the bank a large golden egg. He ran with it to  his mother, who said, \"Go to market, my son; sell your egg, and you  will soon be rich enough to pay a visit to the Squire.\" So to market  Jack went, and sold his golden egg; but the rogue who bought it of  him cheated him out of half his due. Then he dressed himself in his  finest clothes, and went up to the Squire's house. Two footmen stood  at the door, one looking very stout and saucy, and the other sleepy  and stupid.    [Illustration: Jack and Footmen.]    When Jack asked to see the Squire, they laughed at him, and made  sport of his fine clothes; but Jack had wit enough to offer them each  a guinea, when they at once showed him to the Squire's room.    Now the Squire, who was very rich, was also very proud and fat, and  scarcely turned his head to notice Jack; but when he showed him his  bag of gold, and asked for his daughter to be his bride, the Squire  flew into a rage, and ordered his servants to throw him into the  horse-pond. But this was not so easy to do, for Jack was strong and  active; and then the young lady come out and begged her father to  release him. This made Jack more deeply in love with her than ever,  and he went home determined to win her in spite of all. And well did  his wonderful Goose aid him in his design. Almost every morning she  would lay him a golden egg, and Jack, grown wiser, would no longer  sell them at half their value to the rogue who had before cheated  him. So Jack soon grew to be a richer man than the Squire himself.  His wealth became known to all the country round, and the Squire at  length consented to accept Jack as his son-in-law. Then Old Mother  Goose flew away into the woods on the back of her strong Gander,  leaving the cottage and the Goose to Jack and his bride, who lived  happily ever afterwards.
