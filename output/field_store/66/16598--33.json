Ellison and I have worked hand in glove for several years; our qualities  usefully complement one another; there was no earthly reason I could  think of why Ellison should _not_ have come with me, but; I like  Braithwaite; he had been on my General Staff for a time in the Southern  Command; he is cheery, popular and competent.    Wolfe Murray, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, was then called  in, also Archie Murray, Inspector of Home Forces, and Braithwaite. This  was the first (apparently) either of the Murrays had heard of the  project!!! Both seemed to be quite taken aback, and I do not remember  that either of them made a remark.    Braithwaite was very nice and took a chance to whisper his hopes he  would not give me too much cause to regret Ellison. He only said one  thing to K. and that produced an explosion. He said it was vital that we  should have a better air service than the Turks in case it came to  fighting over a small area like the Gallipoli Peninsula: he begged,  therefore, that whatever else we got, or did not get, we might be fitted  out with a contingent of up-to-date aeroplanes, pilots and observers. K.  turned on him with flashing spectacles and rent him with the words,  _\"Not one_!\"    _15th March, 1915. H.M.S. \"Phaeton.\" Toulon Harbour._ Embarked at  Marseilles last night at 6 p.m. and slept on board. Owing to some  mistake no oil fuel had been taken aboard so we have had to come round  here this morning to get it. Have just breakfasted with the Captain,  Cameron by name, and have let the Staff go ashore to see the town. We do  not sail till 2 p.m.: after special trains and everything a clean  chuck-away of 20 hours.    I left off in the S. of S.'s room at the War Office. After the bursting  of the aeroplane bomb K. did most of the talking. I find it hard to  remember all he said: here are the outstanding points:--    (1) We soldiers are to understand we are string Number 2. The sailors  are sure they can force the Dardanelles on their own and the whole  enterprise has been framed on that basis: we are to lie low and to bear  in mind the Cabinet does not want to hear anything of the Army till it  sails through the Straits. But if the Admiral fails, then we will have  to go in.    (2) If the Army has to be used, whether on the Bosphorus or at the  Dardanelles, I am to bear in mind his order that no serious operation is  to take place until the whole of my force is complete; ready;  concentrated and on the spot. No piecemeal attack is to be made.    (3) If we do start fighting, once we _have_ started we are to burn our  boats. Once landed the Government are resolved to see the enterprise  through.    (4) Asia is out of bounds. K. laid special stress on this. Our sea  command and the restricted area of Gallipoli would enable us to  undertake a landing on the Peninsula with clearly limited liabilities.  Once we began marching about continents, situations calling for heavy  reinforcements would probably be created. Although I, Hamilton, seemed  ready to run risks in the defence of London, he, K., was not, and as he  had already explained, big demands would make his position difficult  with France; difficult everywhere; and might end by putting him (K.) in  the cart. Besika Bay and Alexandretta were, therefore, taboo--not to be  touched! Even after we force the Narrows no troops are to be landed  along the Asian coastline. Nor are we to garrison any part of the  Gallipoli Peninsula excepting only the Bulair Lines which had best be  permanently held, K. thinks, by the Naval Division.    When we get into the Marmora I shall be faced by a series of big  problems. What would I do? From what quarter could I attack  Constantinople? How would I hold it when I had taken it? K. asked me  the questions.    With the mud of prosaic Whitehall drying upon my boots these remarks of  K.'s sounded to me odd. But, knowing Constantinople, and--what was more  to the point at the moment--knowing K.'s hatred of hesitation, I managed  to pull myself together so far as to suggest that if the city was weakly  held and if, as he had said, (I forgot to enter that) the bulk of the  Thracian troops were dispersed throughout the Provinces, or else moving  to re-occupy Adrianople, why then, possibly, by a _coup de main_, we  might pounce upon the Chatalja Lines from the South before the Turks  could climb back into them from the North. Lord K. made a grimace; he  thought this too chancy. The best would be if we did not land a man  until the Turks had come to terms. Once the Fleet got through the  Dardanelles, Constantinople could not hold out. Modern Constantinople  could not last a week if blockaded by sea and land. That was a sure  thing; a thing whereon he could speak with full confidence. The Fleet  could lie off out of sight and range of the Turks and with their guns  would dominate the railways and, if necessary, burn the place to ashes.  The bulk of the people were not Osmanli or even Mahomedan and there  would be a revolution at the mere sight of the smoke from the funnels of  our warships. But if, for some cause at present non-apparent, we were  forced to put troops ashore against organized Turkish opposition, then  he advocated a landing on the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus to hold out  a hand to the Russians, who would simultaneously land there from the  Black Sea. He only made the suggestion, for the man on the spot must be  the best judge. Several of the audience left us here, at Lord K.'s  suggestion, to get on with their work. K. went on:--    The moment the holding of Constantinople comes along the French and the  Russians will be very jealous and prickly. Luckily we British have an  easy part to play as the more we efface ourselves at that stage, the  better he, K., will be pleased. The Army in France have means of making  their views work in high places and pressure is sure to be put on by  them and by their friends for the return of the 29th and Naval Divisions  the moment we bring Turkey to book. Therefore, it will be best in any  case to \"let the French and Russians garrison Constantinople and sing  their hymns in S. Sophia,\" whilst my own troops hold the railway line  and perhaps Adrianople. Thus they will be at a loose end and we shall be  free to bring them back to the West; to land them at Odessa or to push  them up the Danube, without weakening the Allied grip on the waterway  linking the Mediterranean with the Black Sea.    This was the essence of our talk: as it lasted about an hour and a half,  I can only have put down about one tenth of it.    At odd times I have been recipient of K.'s reveries but always,  _always_, he has rejected with a sort of horror the idea of being War  Minister or Commander-in-Chief. Now by an extreme exercise of its ironic  spirit, Providence has made him both.    In pre-war days, when we met in Egypt and at Malta, K. made no bones  about what he wanted. He wanted to be Viceroy of India or Ambasssador at  Constantinople.    I remember very well one conversation we had when I asked him why he  wanted to hang on to great place, and whether he had not done enough  already. He said he could not bear to see India being mismanaged by  nincompoops or our influence in Turkey being chucked out of the window  with both hands: I answered him, I remember, by saying there were only  two things worth doing as Viceroy and they would not take very long. One  was to put a huge import duty on aniline dyes and so bring back the  lovely vegetable dyes of old India, the saffrons, indigoes, madders,  etc.; the other was to build a black marble Taj at Agra opposite the  white and join the two by a silver bridge. I expected to get a rise, but  actually he took the ideas quite seriously and I am sure made a mental  note of them. Anyway, as Viceroy, K. would have flung the whole vast  weight of India into the scale of this war; he would have poured Army  after Army from East to West. Under K. India could have beaten Turkey  single-handed; aye, and with one arm tied behind her back. With K. as  Ambassador at Constantinople he would have prevented Turkey coming into  the war. There is no doubt of it. Neither Enver Pasha nor Talaat would  have dared to enrage K., and as for the idea of their deporting him, it  is grotesque. They might have shot him in the back; they could never  have faced him with a war declaration in their hands. As an impresser  of Orientals he is a nonesuch. So we put him into the War Office in the  ways of which he is something of an amateur, with a big prestige and a  big power of drive. Yes, we remove the best experts from the War Office  and pop in K. like a powerful engine from which we have removed all  controls, regulators and safety valves. Yet see what wonders he has  worked!    Still, he remains, in the War Office sense, an amateur. The Staff left  by French at the W.O. may not have been von Moltke's, but they were K.'s  only Councillors. An old War Office hand would have used them. But in no  case, even had they been the best, could K. have had truck or parley  with any system of decentralization of work--of semi-independent  specialists each running a show of his own. As late (so-called) Chief of  Staff to Lord K. in South Africa, I could have told them that whatever  work K. fancies at the moment he must swipe at it, that very moment, off  his own bat. The one-man show carried on royally in South Africa and all  the narrow squeaks we had have been"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19322"],[0,"The Antichrist (#3)"],[1,"confused. One hears without surprise of a Bismarck  philosophizing placidly (at least in his old age) upon the delusion of  Socialism and of a Frederick the Great playing the hose of his cynicism  upon the absolutism that was almost identical with his own person, but  men in the mass never brook the destructive discussion of their  fundamental beliefs, and that impatience is naturally most evident in  those societies in which men in the mass are most influential. Democracy  and free speech are not facets of one gem; democracy and free speech are  eternal enemies. But in any battle between an institution and an idea,  the idea, in the long run, has the better of it. Here I do not venture  into the absurdity of arguing that, as the world wags on, the truth  always survives. I believe nothing of the sort. As a matter of fact, it  seems to me that an idea that happens to be true--or, more exactly, as  near to truth as any human idea can be, and yet remain generally  intelligible--it seems to me that such an idea carries a special and  often fatal handicap. The majority of men prefer delusion to truth. It  soothes. It is easy to grasp. Above all, it fits more snugly than the  truth into a universe of false appearances--of complex and irrational  phenomena, defectively grasped. But though an idea that is true is thus  not likely to prevail, an idea that is _attacked_ enjoys a great  advantage. The evidence behind it is now supported by sympathy, the  sporting instinct, sentimentality--and sentimentality is as powerful as  an army with banners. One never hears of a martyr in history whose  notions are seriously disputed today. The forgotten ideas are those of  the men who put them forward soberly and quietly, hoping fatuously that  they would conquer by the force of their truth; these are the ideas that  we now struggle to rediscover. Had Nietzsche lived to be burned at the  stake by outraged Mississippi Methodists, it would have been a glorious  day for his doctrines. As it is, they are helped on their way every time  they are denounced as immoral and against God. The war brought down upon  them the maledictions of vast herds of right-thinking men. And now \"The  Antichrist,\" after fifteen years of neglect, is being reprinted....    One imagines the author, a sardonic wraith, snickering somewhat sadly  over the fact. His shade, wherever it suffers, is favoured in these days  by many such consolations, some of them of much greater horsepower.  Think of the facts and arguments, even the underlying theories and  attitudes, that have been borrowed from him, consciously and  unconsciously, by the foes of Bolshevism during these last thrilling  years! The face of democracy, suddenly seen hideously close, has scared  the guardians of the reigning plutocracy half to death, and they have  gone to the devil himself for aid. Southern Senators, almost illiterate  men, have mixed his acids with well water and spouted them like  affrighted geysers, not knowing what they did. Nor are they the first to  borrow from him. Years ago I called attention to the debt incurred with  characteristic forgetfulness of obligation by the late Theodore  Roosevelt, in \"The Strenuous Life\" and elsewhere. Roosevelt, a typical  apologist for the existing order, adeptly dragging a herring across the  trail whenever it was menaced, yet managed to delude the native boobery,  at least until toward the end, into accepting him as a fiery exponent of  pure democracy. Perhaps he even fooled himself; charlatans usually do  so soon or late. A study of Nietzsche reveals the sources of much that  was honest in him, and exposes the hollowness of much that was sham.  Nietzsche, an infinitely harder and more courageous intellect, was  incapable of any such confusion of ideas; he seldom allowed  sentimentality to turn him from the glaring fact. What is called  Bolshevism today he saw clearly a generation ago and described for what  it was and is--democracy in another aspect, the old _ressentiment_ of the  lower orders in free function once more. Socialism, Puritanism,  Philistinism, Christianity--he saw them all as allotropic forms of  democracy, as variations upon the endless struggle of quantity against  quality, of the weak and timorous against the strong and enterprising,  of the botched against the fit. The world needed a staggering  exaggeration to make it see even half of the truth. It trembles today as  it trembled during the French Revolution. Perhaps it would tremble less  if it could combat the monster with a clearer conscience and less burden  of compromising theory--if it could launch its forces frankly at the  fundamental doctrine, and not merely employ them to police the  transient orgy.    Nietzsche, in the long run, may help it toward that greater honesty. His  notions, propagated by cuttings from cuttings from cuttings, may  conceivably prepare the way for a sounder, more healthful theory of  society and of the state, and so free human progress from the  stupidities which now hamper it, and men of true vision from the  despairs which now sicken them. I say it is conceivable, but I doubt  that it is probable. The soul and the belly of mankind are too evenly  balanced; it is not likely that the belly will ever put away its hunger  or forget its power. Here, perhaps, there is an example of the eternal  recurrence that Nietzsche was fond of mulling over in his blacker moods.  We are in the midst of one of the perennial risings of the lower orders.  It got under way long before any of the current Bolshevist demons was  born; it was given its long, secure start by the intolerable tyranny of  the plutocracy--the end product of the Eighteenth Century revolt against  the old aristocracy. It found resistance suddenly slackened by civil war  within the plutocracy itself--one gang of traders falling upon another  gang, to the tune of vast hymn-singing and yells to God. Perhaps it has  already passed its apogee; the plutocracy, chastened, shows signs of a  new solidarity; the wheel continues to swing 'round. But this combat  between proletariat and plutocracy is, after all, itself a civil war.  Two inferiorities struggle for the privilege of polluting the world.  What actual difference does it make to a civilized man, when there is a  steel strike, whether the workmen win or the mill-owners win? The  conflict can interest him only as spectacle, as the conflict between  Bonaparte and the old order in Europe interested Goethe and Beethoven.  The victory, whichever way it goes, will simply bring chaos nearer, and  so set the stage for a genuine revolution later on, with (let us hope) a  new feudalism or something better coming out of it, and a new Thirteenth  Century at dawn. This seems to be the slow, costly way of the worst of  habitable worlds.    In the present case my money is laid upon the plutocracy. It will win  because it will be able, in the long run, to enlist the finer  intelligences. The mob and its maudlin causes attract only  sentimentalists and scoundrels, chiefly the latter. Politics, under a  democracy, reduces itself to a mere struggle for office by flatterers  of the proletariat; even when a superior man prevails at that disgusting  game he must prevail at the cost of his self-respect. Not many superior  men make the attempt. The average great captain of the rabble, when he  is not simply a weeper over irremediable wrongs, is a hypocrite so far  gone that he is unconscious of his own hypocrisy--a slimy fellow,  offensive to the nose. The plutocracy can recruit measurably more  respectable janissaries, if only because it can make self-interest less  obviously costly to _amour propre_. Its defect and its weakness lie in  the fact that it is still too young to have acquired dignity. But lately  sprung from the mob it now preys upon, it yet shows some of the habits  of mind of that mob: it is blatant, stupid, ignorant, lacking in all  delicate instinct and governmental finesse. Above all, it remains  somewhat heavily moral. One seldom finds it undertaking one of its  characteristic imbecilities without offering a sonorous moral reason; it  spends almost as much to support the Y. M. C. A., vice-crusading,  Prohibition and other such puerilities as it spends upon Congressmen,  strike-breakers, gun-men, kept patriots and newspapers. In England the  case is even worse. It is almost impossible to find a wealthy industrial  over there who is not also an eminent non-conformist layman, and even  among financiers there are praying brothers. On the Continent, the day  is saved by the fact that the plutocracy tends to become more and more  Jewish. Here the intellectual cynicism of the Jew almost counterbalances  his social unpleasantness. If he is destined to lead the plutocracy of  the world out of Little Bethel he will fail, of course, to turn it into  an aristocracy--_i. e._, a caste of gentlemen--, but he will at least  make it clever, and hence worthy of consideration. The case against the  Jews is long and damning; it would justify ten thousand times as many  pogroms as now go on in the world. But whenever you find a  Davidsbuendlerschaft making practise against the Philistines, there you  will find a Jew laying on. Maybe it was this fact that caused Nietzsche  to speak up for the children of Israel quite as often as he spoke  against them. He was not blind to their faults, but when he set them  beside Christians he could not deny their general superiority. Perhaps  in America and England, as on the Continent, the increasing Jewishness  of the plutocracy, while cutting it off from all chance of ever  developing into an aristocracy, will yet lift it to such a dignity that  it will at least deserve a certain grudging respect.    But even so, it will remain in a sort of half-world, midway between the  gutter and the stars. Above it will still stand the small group of men  that constitutes the permanent aristocracy of the race--the men of  imagination "]]]
