Or, The Voyages and Adventures of Sir Amyas Leigh, Knight, of (#3)"],[1,"of \"Las Casas' History of the West Indies,\" which lay beside  it, lately done into English under the title of \"The Cruelties of the  Spaniards.\" He devoutly believed in fairies, whom he called pixies; and  held that they changed babies, and made the mushroom rings on the downs  to dance in. When he had warts or burns, he went to the white witch  at Northam to charm them away; he thought that the sun moved round the  earth, and that the moon had some kindred with a Cheshire cheese.  He held that the swallows slept all the winter at the bottom of the  horse-pond; talked, like Raleigh, Grenville, and other low persons,  with a broad Devonshire accent; and was in many other respects so very  ignorant a youth, that any pert monitor in a national school might have  had a hearty laugh at him. Nevertheless, this ignorant young savage,  vacant of the glorious gains of the nineteenth century, children's  literature and science made easy, and, worst of all, of those improved  views of English history now current among our railway essayists, which  consist in believing all persons, male and female, before the year 1688,  and nearly all after it, to have been either hypocrites or fools, had  learnt certain things which he would hardly have been taught just now  in any school in England; for his training had been that of the old  Persians, \"to speak the truth and to draw the bow,\" both of which savage  virtues he had acquired to perfection, as well as the equally savage  ones of enduring pain cheerfully, and of believing it to be the finest  thing in the world to be a gentleman; by which word he had been taught  to understand the careful habit of causing needless pain to no human  being, poor or rich, and of taking pride in giving up his own pleasure  for the sake of those who were weaker than himself. Moreover, having  been entrusted for the last year with the breaking of a colt, and the  care of a cast of young hawks which his father had received from Lundy  Isle, he had been profiting much, by the means of those coarse and  frivolous amusements, in perseverance, thoughtfulness, and the habit  of keeping his temper; and though he had never had a single \"object  lesson,\" or been taught to \"use his intellectual powers,\" he knew the  names and ways of every bird, and fish, and fly, and could read, as  cunningly as the oldest sailor, the meaning of every drift of cloud  which crossed the heavens. Lastly, he had been for some time past, on  account of his extraordinary size and strength, undisputed cock of the  school, and the most terrible fighter among all Bideford boys; in which  brutal habit he took much delight, and contrived, strange as it may  seem, to extract from it good, not only for himself but for others,  doing justice among his school-fellows with a heavy hand, and succoring  the oppressed and afflicted; so that he was the terror of all the  sailor-lads, and the pride and stay of all the town's boys and girls,  and hardly considered that he had done his duty in his calling if he  went home without beating a big lad for bullying a little one. For the  rest, he never thought about thinking, or felt about feeling; and had  no ambition whatsoever beyond pleasing his father and mother, getting by  honest means the maximum of \"red quarrenders\" and mazard cherries,  and going to sea when he was big enough. Neither was he what would be  now-a-days called by many a pious child; for though he said his Creed  and Lord's Prayer night and morning, and went to the service at the  church every forenoon, and read the day's Psalms with his mother every  evening, and had learnt from her and from his father (as he proved well  in after life) that it was infinitely noble to do right and infinitely  base to do wrong, yet (the age of children's religious books not having  yet dawned on the world) he knew nothing more of theology, or of his  own soul, than is contained in the Church Catechism. It is a question,  however, on the whole, whether, though grossly ignorant (according to  our modern notions) in science and religion, he was altogether untrained  in manhood, virtue, and godliness; and whether the barbaric narrowness  of his information was not somewhat counterbalanced both in him and in  the rest of his generation by the depth, and breadth, and healthiness of  his education.    So let us watch him up the hill as he goes hugging his horn, to tell all  that has passed to his mother, from whom he had never hidden anything  in his life, save only that sea-fever; and that only because he foreknew  that it would give her pain; and because, moreover, being a prudent and  sensible lad, he knew that he was not yet old enough to go, and that, as  he expressed it to her that afternoon, \"there was no use hollaing till  he was out of the wood.\"    So he goes up between the rich lane-banks, heavy with drooping ferns and  honeysuckle; out upon the windy down toward the old Court, nestled  amid its ring of wind-clipt oaks; through the gray gateway into the  homeclose; and then he pauses a moment to look around; first at the wide  bay to the westward, with its southern wall of purple cliffs; then at  the dim Isle of Lundy far away at sea; then at the cliffs and downs of  Morte and Braunton, right in front of him; then at the vast yellow sheet  of rolling sand-hill, and green alluvial plain dotted with red cattle,  at his feet, through which the silver estuary winds onward toward the  sea. Beneath him, on his right, the Torridge, like a land-locked lake,  sleeps broad and bright between the old park of Tapeley and the charmed  rock of the Hubbastone, where, seven hundred years ago, the Norse rovers  landed to lay siege to Kenwith Castle, a mile away on his left hand; and  not three fields away, are the old stones of \"The Bloody Corner,\"  where the retreating Danes, cut off from their ships, made their last  fruitless stand against the Saxon sheriff and the valiant men of Devon.  Within that charmed rock, so Torridge boatmen tell, sleeps now the old  Norse Viking in his leaden coffin, with all his fairy treasure and his  crown of gold; and as the boy looks at the spot, he fancies, and almost  hopes, that the day may come when he shall have to do his duty against  the invader as boldly as the men of Devon did then. And past him, far  below, upon the soft southeastern breeze, the stately ships go sliding  out to sea. When shall he sail in them, and see the wonders of the deep?  And as he stands there with beating heart and kindling eye, the cool  breeze whistling through his long fair curls, he is a symbol, though he  knows it not, of brave young England longing to wing its way out of its  island prison, to discover and to traffic, to colonize and to civilize,  until no wind can sweep the earth which does not bear the echoes of an  English voice. Patience, young Amyas! Thou too shalt forth, and westward  ho, beyond thy wildest dreams; and see brave sights, and do brave deeds,  which no man has since the foundation of the world. Thou too shalt face  invaders stronger and more cruel far than Dane or Norman, and bear thy  part in that great Titan strife before the renown of which the name of  Salamis shall fade away!    Mr. Oxenham came that evening to supper as he had promised: but as  people supped in those days in much the same manner as they do now, we  may drop the thread of the story for a few hours, and take it up again  after supper is over.    \"Come now, Dick Grenville, do thou talk the good man round, and I'll  warrant myself to talk round the good wife.\"    The personage whom Oxenham addressed thus familiarly answered by a  somewhat sarcastic smile, and, \"Mr. Oxenham gives Dick Grenville\" (with  just enough emphasis on the \"Mr.\" and the \"Dick,\" to hint that a liberty  had been taken with him) \"overmuch credit with the men. Mr. Oxenham's  credit with fair ladies, none can doubt. Friend Leigh, is Heard's great  ship home yet from the Straits?\"    The speaker, known well in those days as Sir Richard Grenville,  Granville, Greenvil, Greenfield, with two or three other variations, was  one of those truly heroical personages whom Providence, fitting always  the men to their age and their work, had sent upon the earth whereof it  takes right good care, not in England only, but in Spain and Italy, in  Germany and the Netherlands, and wherever, in short, great men and great  deeds were needed to lift the mediaeval world into the modern.    And, among all the heroic faces which the painters of that age have  preserved, none, perhaps, hardly excepting Shakespeare's or Spenser's,  Alva's or Farina's, is more heroic than that of Richard Grenville, as it  stands in Prince's \"Worthies of Devon;\" of a Spanish type, perhaps  (or more truly speaking, a Cornish), rather than an English, with just  enough of the British element in it to give delicacy to its massiveness.  The forehead and whole brain are of extraordinary loftiness, and  perfectly upright; the nose long, aquiline, and delicately pointed;  the mouth fringed with a short silky beard, small and ripe, yet firm  as granite, with just pout enough of the lower lip to give hint of that  capacity of noble indignation which lay hid under its usual courtly calm  and sweetness; if there be a defect in the face, it is that the eyes are  somewhat small, and close together, and the eyebrows, though delicately  arched, and, without a trace of peevishness, too closely pressed  down upon them, the complexion is dark, the figure tall and graceful;  altogether the likeness of a wise and gallant gentleman, lovely to all  good men, awful to all bad men; in whose presence none dare say or do a  mean or a ribald thing; whom brave men left, feeling themselves nerved  to do their duty better, while cowards slipped away, as bats and  owls before the sun. So he lived and moved, whether in the Court of  Elizabeth, giving his counsel among the wisest; or in the streets of  Bideford, capped alike by squire and"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18613"],[0,"The Golden Scorpion (#3)"],[1," to a dismayed acceptance  of a wild infatuation.    He had no idea who Mlle. Dorian was; he did not even know her exact  nationality, but he strongly suspected there was a strain of Eastern  blood in her veins. Although she was quite young, apparently little  more than twenty years of age, she dressed like a woman of unlimited  means, and although all her visits had been at night he had had  glimpses of the big car which had aroused Mrs. M'Gregor's displeasure.    Yes--so ran his musings, as, pipe in mouth, he rested his chin in his  hands and stared grimly into the fire--she had always come at night  and always alone. He had supposed her to be a Frenchwoman, but an  unmarried French girl of good family does not make late calls, even  upon a medical man, unattended. Had he perchance unwittingly made  himself a party to the escapade of some unruly member of a noble  family? From the first he had shrewdly suspected the ailments of Mlle.  Dorian to be imaginary--Mlle. Dorian? It was an odd name.    \"I shall be imagining she is a disguised princess if I wonder about  her any more!\" he muttered angrily.    Detecting himself in the act of heaving a weary sigh, he coughed in  self-reproval and reached into a pigeon-hole for the MS. of his  unfinished paper on \"Snake Poisons and Their Antidotes.\" By chance he  pulled out the brief account, written the same morning, of his uncanny  experience during the night. He read it through reflectively.    It was incomplete. A certain mental haziness which he had noted upon  awakening had in some way obscured the facts. His memory of the dream  had been imperfect. Even now, whilst recognizing that some feature of  the experience was missing from his written account, he could not  identify the omission. But one memory arose starkly before him--that  of the cowled man who had stood behind the curtains. It had power to  chill him yet. The old incredulity returned and methodically he  re-examined the contents of some of the table drawers. Ere long,  however, he desisted impatiently.    \"What the devil could a penniless doctor have hidden in his desk that  was worth stealing!\" he said aloud. \"I must avoid cold salmon and  cucumber in future.\"    He tossed the statement aside and turned to his scientific paper.    There came knock at the door.    \"Come in!\" snapped Stuart irritably; but the next moment he had turned,  eager-eyed to the servant who had entered.    \"Inspector Dunbar has called, sir.\"    \"Oh, all right,\" said Stuart, repressing another sigh. \"Show him in  here.\"    There entered, shortly, a man of unusual height, a man gaunt and  square both of figure and of face. He wore his clothes and his hair  untidily. He was iron grey and a grim mouth was ill concealed by the  wiry moustache. The most notable features of a striking face were the  tawny leonine eyes, which could be fierce, which could be pensive and  which were often kindly.    \"Good evening, doctor,\" he said--and his voice was pleasant and  unexpectedly light in tome. \"Hope I don't intrude.\"    \"Not at all, Inspector,\" Stuart assured him.    \"Make yourself comfortable in the armchair and fill your pipe.\"    \"Thanks,\" said Dunbar. \"I will.\" He took out his pipe and reached out  a long arm for the tobacco jar. \"I came to see if you could give me a  tip on a matter that has cropped up.\"    \"Something in my line?\" asked Stuart, a keen professional look coming  momentarily into his eyes.    \"It's supposed to be a poison case, although I can't see it myself,\"  answered the detective--to whom Keppel Stuart's unusual knowledge of  poisons had been of service in the past; \"but if what I suspect is  true, it's a very big case all the same.\"    Laying down his pipe, which he had filled but not lighted, Inspector  Dunbar pulled out from the inside pocket of his tweed coat a bulging  note-book and extracted therefrom some small object wrapped up in  tissue paper. Unwrapping this object, he laid it upon the table.    \"Tell me what that is, doctor,\" he said, \"and I shall be obliged.\"    Stuart peered closely at that which lay before him. It was a piece of  curiously shaped gold, cunningly engraved in a most unusual way.  Rather less than an inch in length, it formed a crescent made up of  six oval segments joined one to another, the sixth terminating in a  curled point. The first and largest segment ended jaggedly where it  had evidently been snapped off from the rest of the ornament--if the  thing had formed part of an ornament. Stuart looked up, frowning in  a puzzled way.    \"It is a most curious fragment of jewellery--possibly of Indian  origin,\" he said.    Inspector Dunbar lighted his pipe and tossed the match-end into the  fire. \"But what does it represent?\" he asked.    \"Oh, as to that--I said a _curious_ fragment advisedly, because I  cannot imagine any woman wearing such a beastly thing. It is the _tail  of a scorpion._\"    \"Ah!\" cried Dunbar, the tawny eyes glittering with excitement. \"The  tail of a scorpion! I thought so! And Sowerby would have it that it  represented the stem of a Cactus or Prickly Pear!\"    \"Not so bad a guess,\" replied Stuart. \"There _are_ resemblances--not  in the originals but in such a miniature reproduction as this. He was  wrong, however. May I ask where you obtained the fragment?\"    \"I'm here to tell you, doctor, for now that I know it's a scorpion's  tail I know that I'm out of my depth as well. You've travelled in  the East and lived in the East--two very different things. Now, while  you were out there, in India, China, Burma, and so on, did you ever  come across a religion or a cult that worshipped scorpions?\"    Stuart frowned thoughtfully, rubbing his chin with the mouthpiece of  his pipe. Dunbar watched him expectantly.    \"Help yourself to whiskey-and-soda, Inspector,\" said Stuart absently.  \"You'll find everything on the side-table yonder. I'm thinking.\"    Inspector Dunbar nodded, stood up and crossed the room, where he  busied himself with syphon and decanter. Presently he returned,  carrying two full glasses, one of which he set before Stuart. \"What's  the answer, doctor?\" he asked.    \"The answer is _no_. I am not acquainted with any sect of  scorpion-worshippers, Inspector. But I once met with a curious  experience at Su-Chow in China, which I have never been able to  explain, but which may interest you. It wanted but a few minutes to  sunset, and I was anxious to get back to my quarters before dusk fell.  Therefore I hurried up my boy, who was drawing the rickshaw, telling  him to cross the Canal by the Wu-men Bridge. He ran fleetly in that  direction, and we were actually come to the steep acclivity of the  bridge, when suddenly the boy dropped the shafts and fell down on his  knees, hiding his face in his hands.    \"'Shut your eyes tightly, master!' he whispered. 'The Scorpion is  coming!'    \"I stared down at him in amazement, as was natural, and not a little  angrily; for his sudden action had almost pitched me on my head. But  there he crouched, immovable, and staring up the slope I say that it  was entirely deserted except for one  strange figure at that moment  crossing the crown of the bridge and approaching. It was the figure  of a tall and dignified Chinaman, or of one who wore the dress of a  Chinaman. For the extra-ordinary thing about the stranger's appearance  was this; he also wore a thick green veil!\"    \"Covering his face?\"    \"So as to cover his face completely. I was staring at him in wonder,  when the boy, seeming to divine the other's approach, whispered,  'Turn your head away! Turn your head away!\"    \"He was referring to the man with the veil?\"    \"Undoubtedly. Of course I did nothing of the kind, but it was  impossible to discern the stranger's features through the thick gauze,  although he passed quite close to me. He had not proceeded another  three paces, I should think, before my boy had snatched up the shafts  and darted across the bridge as though all hell were after him! Here's  the odd thing, though; I could never induce him to speak a word on the  subject afterwards! I bullied him and bribed him, but all to no  purpose. And although I must have asked more than a hundred Chinamen  in every station of society from mandarin to mendicant, 'Who or what  is _The Scorpion?_' one and all looked stupid, blandly assuring me  that they did not know what I meant.\"    \"H'm!\" said Dunbar, \"it's a queer yarn, certainly. How long ago would  that be, doctor?\"    \"Roughly--five years.\"    \"It sounds as though it might belong to the case. Some months back,  early in the winter, we received instructions at the Yard to look out  everywhere in the press, in buffets, theatres, but particularly in  criminal quarters, for any reference (of any kind whatever) to a  scorpion. I was so puzzled that I saw the Commissioner about it,  and he could tell me next to nothing. He said the word had come  through from Paris, but that Paris seemed to know no more about it  than we did. It was associated in some way with the sudden deaths of  several notable public men about that time; but as there was no  evidence of foul play in any of the cases, I couldn't see what it  meant at all. Then, six weeks ago, Sir Frank Narcombe, the surgeon,  fell dead in the foyer of a West-End theatre--you remember?\"          CHAPTER IV    MADEMOISELLE DORIAN      The telephone bell rang.    Stuart reached across for the instrument and raised the receiver.  \"Yes,\" he said--\"Dr. Stuart speaking. Inspector Dunbar is here. Hold  on.\"    He passed the instrument to Dunbar, who had stood up on hearing his  name mentioned. \"Sergeant Sowerby at Scotland Yard wishes to speak  to you, Inspector.\"    \"Hullo,\" said Dunbar--\"that you, Sowerby. Yes--but I arrived here  only a short time ago. What's that?--Max? Good God! what does it all  mean! Are you sure of the number--49685? Poor chap--he should have  worked with us instead of going off alone like that. But he was  always given to that sort of thing. Wait"]]]
