In 1858 the  disease was carried to Australia by an English cow, and, spreading to  the cattle ranges, almost depopulated them.    In 1843 an infected Dutch cow brought the disease to Brooklyn, where  it has since lingered, slowly spreading among the cattle in Kings and  Queens counties. In 1847 several head of infected English cattle were  imported into New Jersey, and, spreading among a herd of valuable  cattle, made it necessary for them all to be slaughtered, the only  certain method of stamping out the disease. In 1859 four infected cows  were imported into Massachusetts from Holland; the plague spread  rapidly, and was stamped out only by persistent effort, the State  paying for over 1,000 slaughtered cattle. Since 1867 the disease has  not been known there. Meantime the pest had invaded Eastern  Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Maryland, where it has since prevailed in  isolated localities. The absence of large herds of moving cattle in  these districts, except for speedy slaughter, has prevented the  disease from developing into a general plague.    The recent action of the British Council in forbidding the importation  of American live cattle is likely to prove of inestimable benefit to  this country, in forcibly calling attention to the grave risk that the  presence of the disease on Long Island and elsewhere constantly  entails. Fortunately the drift of the cattle traffic is eastward, and  as yet there has been no propagation of the poison in the great cattle  ranges of the West. Unless summarily arrested, however, the disease  will surely reach those sources of our cattle supply, and occasion  losses that can be estimated only in hundreds of millions of dollars.    The experience of all countries into which this disease has gained  access appears to prove that there is only one way of getting rid of  it--namely, the immediate killing of all infected cattle, and the  thorough disinfection of the premises in which they are found.    The disease is purely infectious, and is never found in regions where  it has not gained a foothold by importation. Palliative measures have  in every instance failed to eradicate the disease, and are only  justifiable, as in Australia, after the plague has reached dimensions  utterly beyond the reach of any process of extermination.    Professor Law, of Cornell University, one of our best informed  veterinary surgeons, most emphatically opposes every attempt to  control the disease by quarantining the sick or by the inoculation of  the healthy. \"We may quarantine the sick,\" he says, \"but we cannot  quarantine the air.\" To establish quarantine yards is simply to  maintain prolific manufacturers of the poison, which is given off by  the breath of the sick, and by their excretions, to such an extent  that no watchfulness can insure against its dissemination. Besides,  the expense of thorough quarantining operations would amount to more  than the value of the infected animals whose lives might be saved  thereby. Inoculation is still less to be tolerated at this stage of  the pest.    The Professor says: \"Germany, Holland, Belgium, France, and England,  have been treating the victims of this plague for nearly half a  century, but the result has only been the increase of disease and  death. Our own infected States have been treating it for a third of a  century, and to-day it exists over a wider area than ever before.  Contrast this with the results in Massachusetts and Connecticut, where  the disease has been repeatedly crushed out at small expense, and  there can be no doubt as to which is the wisest course. As all the  plagues are alike in the propagation of the poison in the bodies of  the sick, I may be allowed to adduce the experience of two adjacent  counties in Scotland when invaded by the rinderpest. Aberdeen raised a  fund of L2,000, and though she suffered several successive  invasions, she speedily crushed out the poison wherever it appeared by  slaughtering the sick beasts and disinfecting the premises. The result  was that little more than half the fund was wanted to reimburse the  owners for their losses, and the splendid herds of the county were  preserved. Forfar, on the other hand, set herself to cure the plague,  with the result of a universal infection, the loss of many thousands  of cattle, and the ruin of hundreds of farmers. Finally the malady was  crushed out in the entire island by the method adopted by Aberdeen and  other well advised counties at the outset.\"    And again, \"Cattle have been inoculated by the tens of thousands in  Belgium and Holland, and of all Europe these are the countries now  most extensively infected. France, Prussia, Italy, Austria, and  England have each practiced it on a large scale, and each remains a  home of the plague. Australia has followed the practice, and is now  and must continue an infected country. Our own infected States have  inoculated, and the disease has survived and spread in spite of it,  and even by its aid. Whatever country has definitively exterminated  the plague (Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Holstein, Mecklenburg,  Switzerland, Massachusetts, and Connecticut), that country has  prohibited inoculation and all other methods that prevail on the  principle of preserving the sick, and has relied on the slaughter of  the infected and the thorough disinfection of their surroundings. So  will it be with us. If any State adopts or allows any of these  temporizing measures, that State will only repeat the experience of  the past alike in the Old World and the New, will perpetuate the  disease in the country, will entail great losses on its citizens, will  keep up the need for constant watchfulness and great expense by the  adjoining States for their own protection, and will indefinitely  postpone the resumption of the foreign live stock trade, which, a few  months ago, promised to be one of the most valuable branches of our  international commerce.\"    We are persuaded that the position taken by Professor Law, and other  similar-minded veterinary surgeons, is the only safe one. The disease  can be stamped out now with comparatively small loss. If trifled with,  and tolerated, it cannot but result in a great national calamity.           *       *       *       *       *          SPAIN A FIELD FOR MACHINERY AND PATENTS.      From a too lengthy communication to admit in full to our columns, a  resident of Madrid communicates to the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN some facts  relative to the fertility of the soil of Spain, her necessity for  improved agricultural and other implements, and closes with the  assertion that it is a good field withal for patents. We cull from the  letter as follows:    I have lived, says the writer, for a number of years in this beautiful  country, so little understood by foreigners, so little appreciated by  its own inhabitants. The Spain of romance, poetry, and song, is the  garden as well as the California of Europe. But it stands in great  need of the health-giving touch of the North American enterprise. We  have here the same mineral treasures, the same unrivaled advantages of  climate, that made Spain once the industrial and commercial emporium  of the world.    But Spain is awakening. She is endeavoring to shake off her lethargy.  The late Exhibition of Paris has proved this; and those who are  familiar with the past history and present condition of Spain have  been astonished at the result of this effort. A new era has commenced  for the country, and it is everywhere evident that a strong current of  enterprise and industry has set in. But it is with nations, as with  individuals, when they have remained long in complete inaction, brain  and muscles are torpid and cannot at first obey the will. Spain needs  the assistance of other nations hardened and inured to toil.    The plows now used to till the land are precisely such as were those  left by the Moors in the unfinished furrow, when with tears and sighs  they bade farewell to their broad fields, their mosques and palaces,  whose ideal architecture is still the wonder of the world, to go forth  as outcasts and exiles in obedience to the cruel edict that drove them  away to the deserts of Africa.    I doubt whether there is an American plow in Spain, much less a steam  plow. Sowing and reaping machines are here unknown, and grain is tread  out by oxen and mules just as it was in Scripture times, and cleaned  by women, who toss it in the air to scatter the chaff. Everything is  primitive and Oriental here as yet.    Spain could supply all Europe with butter and cheese, and, on the  contrary, these articles are imported in large quantities from  England, Holland, and Switzerland. The traveler crosses leagues and  leagues of meadow land where not a tree is to be seen, nor one sheep  pasture, and which are nevertheless watered by broad rivers that carry  away to the ocean the water that would, by irrigation, convert these  fields into productive farms. There are many places in Spain where the  wine is thrown away for want of purchasers and vats in which to keep  it. In the Upper Aragon, the mortar with which the houses are built is  made with wine instead of water, the former being the most plentiful.  Aragon needs an enterprising American company to convert into  wholesome table wine the infinite varieties there produced, and which  our neighbors the French buy and carry away to convert into Bordeaux.    We want American enterprise in Galicia and Asturias, where milk is  almost given away, to convert it into the best of butter and cheese;  and also in those same provinces, where delicious fruit is grown in  such abundance that it is left on the ground for the swine.    Spain needs many more railroads and canals, all of which, when  constructed, are subsidized by the government; the railroads at the  rate of $12,000 a kilometer, and "]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18869"],[0,"On Limitations to the Use of Some Anthropologic Data (#3)"],[1," e._, degradation; for the people originally able to communicate with  each other can no longer thus communicate; so that two languages do not  serve as valuable a purpose as one. And, further, neither of the two  languages has made the progress one would have made, for one would have  been developed sufficiently to serve all the purposes of the united  peoples in the larger area inhabited by them, and, _coeteris paribus_,  the language spoken by many people scattered over a large area must be  superior to one spoken by a few people inhabiting a small area.    It would have been strange, indeed, had the primitive assumption in  philology been true, and the history of language exhibited universal  degradation.    In the remarks on the \"Origin of Man,\" the statement was made that  mankind was distributed throughout the habitable earth, in some  geological period anterior to the present and anterior to the  development of other than the rudest arts. Here, again, we reach the  conclusion that man was distributed throughout the earth anterior to the  development of organized speech.    In the presence of these two great facts, the difficulty of tracing  genetic relationship among human races through arts, customs,  institutions, and traditions will appear, for all of these must have  been developed after the dispersion of mankind. Analogies and homologies  in these phenomena must be accounted for in some other way. Somatology  proves the unity of the human species; that is, the evidence upon which  this conclusion is reached is morphologic; but in arts, customs,  institutions, and traditions abundant corroborative evidence is found.  The individuals of the one species, though inhabiting diverse climes,  speaking diverse languages, and organized into diverse communities, have  progressed in a broad way by the same stages, have had the same arts,  customs, institutions, and traditions in the same order, limited only by  the degree of progress to which the several tribes have attained, and  modified only to a limited extent by variations in environment.    If any ethnic classification of mankind is to be established more  fundamental than that based upon language, it must be upon physical  characteristics, and such must have been acquired by profound  differentiation anterior to the development of languages, arts, customs,  institutions, and traditions. The classifications hitherto made on this  basis are unsatisfactory, and no one now receives wide acceptance.  Perhaps further research will clear up doubtful matters and give an  acceptable grouping; or it may be that such research will result only in  exhibiting the futility of the effort.    The history of man, from the lowest tribal condition to the highest  national organization, has been a history of constant and multifarious  admixture of strains of blood; of admixture, absorption, and destruction  of languages with general progress toward unity; of the diffusion of  arts by various processes of acculturation; and of admixture and  reciprocal diffusion of customs, institutions, and traditions. Arts,  customs, institutions, and traditions extend beyond the boundaries of  languages and serve to obscure them, and the admixture of strains of  blood has obscured primitive ethnic divisions, if such existed.    If the physical classification fails, the most fundamental grouping left  is that based on language; but for the reasons already mentioned and  others of like character, the classification of languages is not, to the  full extent, a classification of peoples.    It may be that the unity of the human race is a fact so profound that  all attempts at a fundamental classification to be used in all the  departments of anthropology will fail, and that there will remain  multifarious groupings for the multifarious purposes of the science; or,  otherwise expressed, that languages, arts, customs, institutions, and  traditions may be classified, and that the human family will be  considered as one race.      MYTHOLOGY.    Here again America presents a rich field for the scientific explorer. It  is now known that each linguistic stock has a distinct mythology, and as  in some of these stocks there are many languages differing to a greater  or less extent, so there are many like differing mythologies.    As in language, so in mythology, investigation has proceeded from, the  known to the unknown--from the higher to the lower mythologies. In each  step of the progress of opinion on this subject a particular phenomenon  may be observed. As each lower status of mythology is discovered it is  assumed to be the first in origin, the primordial mythology, and all  lower but imperfectly understood mythologies are interpreted as  degradations, from this assumed original belief; thus polytheism was  interpreted as a degeneracy from monotheism; nature worship, from  psychotheism; zooelotry, from ancestor worship; and, in order, monotheism  has been held to be the original mythology, then polytheism, then  physitheism or nature worship, then ancestor worship.    With a large body of mythologists nature worship is now accepted as the  primitive religion; and with another body, equally as respectable,  ancestor worship is primordial. But nature worship and ancestor worship  are concomitant parts of the same religion, and belong to a status of  culture highly advanced and characterized by the invention of  conventional pictographs. In North America we have scores or even  hundreds of systems of mythology, all belonging to a lower state of  culture.    Let us hope that American students will not fall into this line of error  by assuming that zooetheism is the lowest stage, because this is the  status of mythology most widely spread on the continent.    Mythology is primitive philosophy. A mythology--that is, the body of  myths current among any people and believed by them--comprises a system  of explanations of all the phenomena of the universe discerned by them;  but such explanations are always mixed with much extraneous matter,  chiefly incidents in the history of the personages who were the heroes  of mythologic deeds.    Every mythology has for its basis a theology--a system of gods who are  the actors, and to whom are attributed the phenomena to be  explained--for the fundamental postulate in mythology is \"some one does  it,\" such being the essential characteristic of subjective reasoning. As  peoples pass from one stage of culture to another, the change is made by  developing a new sociology with all its institutions, by the development  of new arts, by evolution of language, and, in a degree no less, by a  change in philosophy; but the old philosophy is not supplanted. The  change is made by internal growth and external accretion.    Fragments of the older are found in the newer. This older material in  the newer philosophy is often used for curious purposes by many  scholars. One such use I wish to mention here. The nomenclature which  has survived from the earlier state is supposed to be deeply and  occultly symbolic and the mythic narratives to be deeply and occultly  allegoric. In this way search is made for some profoundly metaphysic  cosmogony; some ancient beginning of the mythology is sought in which  mystery is wisdom and wisdom is mystery.    The objective or scientific method of studying a mythology is to collect  and collate its phenomena simply as it is stated and understood by the  people to whom it belongs. In tracing back the threads of its historical  development the student should expect to find it more simple and  childlike in every stage of his progress.    It is vain to search for truth in mythologic philosophy, but it is  important to search for veritable philosphies, that they may be properly  compared and that the products of the human mind in its various stages  of culture may be known; important in the reconstruction of the history  of philosophy; and important in furnishing necessary data to psychology.  No labor can be more fruitless than the search in mythology for true  philosophy; and the efforts to build up from the terminology and  narratives of mythologies an occult symbolism and system of allegory is  but to create a new and fictitious body of mythology.    There is a symbolism inherent in language and found in all philosophy,  true or false, and such symbolism was cultivated as an occult art in the  early history of civilization when picture-writing developed into  conventional writing, and symbolism is an interesting subject for study,  but it has been made a beast of burden to carry packs of metaphysic  nonsense.      SOCIOLOGY.    Here again North America presents a wide and interesting field to the  investigator, for it has within its extent many distinct governments,  and these governments, so far as investigations have been carried, are  found to belong to a type more primitive than any of the feudalities  from which the civilized nations of the earth sprang, as shown by  concurrently recorded history.    Yet in this history many facts have been discovered suggesting that  feudalities themselves had an origin in something more primitive. In the  study of the tribes of the world a multitude of sociologic institutions  and customs have been discovered, and in reviewing the history of  feudalities it is seen that many of their important elements are  survivals from tribal society.    So important are these discoveries that all human history has to be  rewritten, the whole philosophy of history reconstructed. Government  does not begin in the ascendency of chieftains through prowess in war,  but in the slow specialization of executive functions from communal  associations based on kinship. Deliberative assemblies do not start in  councils gathered by chieftains, but councils precede chieftaincies. Law  does not begin in contract, but is the development of custom. Land  tenure does not begin in grants from the monarch or the feudal lord, but"]]]
