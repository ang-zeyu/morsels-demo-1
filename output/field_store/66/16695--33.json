Daddy and Uncle Jacob keep our family together somehow and  head across the line into Kansas. We all get to Fort Scott where there  was a big army camp; daddy work in the blacksmith shop and Uncle Jacob  join with the Northern soldiers to fight against the South. He come  through the war and live to tell me about the fighting he been in.    He went with the soldiers down around Fort Gibson where they fight the  Indians who stayed with the South. Uncle Jacob say he killed many a  man during the war, and showed me the musket and sword he used to  fight with; said he didn't shoot the women and children--just whack  their heads off with the sword, and almost could I see the blood  dripping from the point! It made me scared at his stories.    The captain of this company want his men to be brave and not get  scared, so before the fighting start he put out a tub of white liquor  (corn whiskey) and steam them up so's they'd be mean enough to whip  their grannie! The soldiers do lots of riding and the saddle-sores get  so bad they grease their body every night with snake oil so's they  could keep going on.    Uncle Jacob said the biggest battle was at Honey Springs (1863). That  was down near Elk Creek, close by Checotah, below Rentiersville. He  said it was the most terrible fighting he seen, but the Union soldiers  whipped and went back into Fort Gibson. The Rebels was chased all over  the country and couldn't find each other for a long time, the way he  tell it.    After the war our family come back here and settle at Fort Gibson, but  it ain't like the place my mother told me about. There was big houses  and buildings of brick setting on the high land above the river when I  first see it, not like she know it when the Perrymans come here years  ago.    She heard the Indians talk about the old fort (1824), the one that rot  down long before the Civil War. And she seen it herself when she go  with the Master for trading with the stores. She said it was made by  Matthew Arbuckle and his soldiers, and she talk about Companys B, C,  D, K, and the Seventh Infantry who was there and made the Osage  Indians stop fighting the Creeks and Cherokees. She talk of it, but  that old place all gone when I first see the Fort.    Then I hear about how after the Arbuckle soldiers leave the old log  fort, the Cherokee Indians take over the land and start up the town of  Keetoowah. The folks who move in there make the place so wild and  rascally the Cherokees give up trying to make a good town and it  kinder blow away.    My husband was Tom Banks, but the boy I got ain't my own son, but I  found him on my doorstep when he's about three weeks old and raise him  like he is my own blood. He went to school at the manual training  school at Tullahassee and the education he got get him a teacher job  at Taft (Okla), where he is now.

I'm getting old and it's easy to forget most of the happenings of  slave days; anyway I was too little to know much about them, for my  mammy told me I was born about six years before the War. My folks was  on their way to Fort Gibson, and on the trip I was born at Boggy  Depot, down in southern Oklahoma.    There was a lot of us children; I got their names somewheres here.  Yes, there was George, Sarah, Emma, Stella, Sylvia, Lucinda, Rose,  Dan, Pamp, Jeff, Austin, Jessie, Isaac and Andrew; we all lived in a  one-room log cabin on Master Rogers' place not far from the old  military road near Choteau. Mammy was raised around the Cherokee town  of Tahlequah.    I got my name from the Rogers', but I was loaned around to their  relatives most of the time. I helped around the house for Bill  McCracken, then I was with Cornelius and Carline Wright, and when I  was freed my Mistress was a Mrs. O'Neal, wife of a officer at Fort  Gibson. She treated me the best of all and gave me the first doll I  ever had. It was a rag doll with charcoal eyes and red thread worked  in for the mouth. She allowed me one hour every day to play with it.  When the War ended Mistress O'Neal wanted to take me with her to  Richmond, Virginia, but my people wouldn't let me go. I wanted to stay  with her, she was so good, and she promised to come back for me when I  get older, but she never did.    All the time I was at the fort I hear the bugles and see the soldiers  marching around, but never did I see any battles. The fighting must  have been too far away.    Master Rogers kept all our family together, but my folks have told me  about how the slaves was sold. One of my aunts was a mean, fighting  woman. She was to be sold and when the bidding started she grabbed a  hatchet, laid her hand on a log and chopped it off. Then she throwed  the bleeding hand right in her master's face. Not long ago I hear she  is still living in the country around Nowata, Oklahoma.    Sometimes I would try to get mean, but always I got me a whipping for  it. When I was a little girl, moving around from one family to  another, I done housework, ironing, peeling potatoes and helping the  main cook. I went barefoot most of my life, but the master would get  his shoes from the Government at Fort Gibson.    I wore cotton dresses, and the Mistress wore long dresses, with  different colors for Sunday clothes, but us slaves didn't know much  about Sunday in a religious way. The Master had a brother who used to  preach to the Negroes on the sly. One time he was caught and the  Master whipped him something awful.    Years ago I married Joe Bean. Our children died as babies. Twenty year  ago Joe Bean and I separated for good and all.    The good Lord knows I'm glad slavery is over. Now I can stay peaceful  in one place--that's all I aim to do.          Oklahoma Writers' Project  Ex-Slaves  [Date stamp: AUG 16 1937]      PRINCE BEE  Age 85 yrs.  Red Bird, Okla.      I don't know how old I was when I found myself standing on the toppen  part of a high stump with a lot of white folks walking around looking  at the little scared boy that was me. Pretty soon the old master,  (that's my first master) Saul Nudville, he say to me that I'm now  belonging to Major Bee and for me to get down off the auction block.    I do that. Major Bee he comes over and right away I know I'm going to  like him. Then when I get to the Major's plantation and see his oldest  daughter Mary and all her brothers and sisters, and see how kind she  is to all them and to all the colored children, why, I just keeps  right on liking 'em more all the time.    They was about nine white children on the place and Mary had to watch  out for them 'cause the mother was dead.    That Mary gal seen to it that we children got the best food on the  place, the fattest possum and the hottest fish. When the possum was  all browned, and the sweet 'taters swimming in the good mellow gravy,  then she call us for to eat. Um-um-h! That was tasty eating!    And from the garden come the vegetables like okra and corn and onions  that Mary would mix all up in the soup pot with lean meats. That would  rest kinder easy on the stomach too, 'specially if they was a bit of  red squirrel meats in with the stew!    Major Bee say it wasn't good for me to learn reading and writing.  Reckoned it would ruin me. But they sent me to Sunday School.  Sometimes. Wasn't many of the slaves knew how to read the Bible  either, but they all got the religion anyhow. I believed in it then  and I still do.    That religion I got in them way back days is still with me. And it  ain't this pie crust religion such as the folks are getting these  days. The old time religion had some filling between the crusts,  wasn't so many empty words like they is today.    They was haunts in them way back days, too. How's I know? 'Cause I  stayed right with the haunts one whole night when I get caught in a  norther when the Major sends me to another plantation for to bring  back some cows he's bargained for. That was a cold night and a  frightful one.    The blizzard overtook me and it was dark on the way. I come to an old  gin house that everybody said was the hauntinest place in all the  county. But I went in account of the cold and then when the noises  started I was just too scared to move, so there I stood in the corner,  all the time 'til morning come.    There was nobody I could see, but I could hear peoples feet a-tromping  and stomping around the room and they go up and down the stairway like  they was running a race.    Sometimes the noises would be right by my side and I would feel like a  hot wind passing around me, and lights would flash all over the room.  Nobody could I see. When daylight come I went through that door  without looking back and headed for the plantation, forgetting all  about the cows that Major Bee sent me for to get.    When I tells them about the thing, Mary she won't let the old Major  scold, and she fixes me up with some warm foods and I is all right  again. But I stays me away from that gin place, even in the daylight,  account of the haunts.    When the War come along the Major got kinder mean with some of the  slaves, but not with me. I never did try to run off, but some of 'em  did. One of my brothers tried and got caught.    The old Master whipped him 'til the blood spurted all over his body,  the bull whip cutting in deeper all the time. He finish up the  whipping with a wet coarse towel and the end got my brother in the  eye. He was blinded in the one eye but the other eye is good enough he  can see they ain't no use trying to run away no more.    After the War they was more whippings. This time it was the night  riders--them Klan folks didn't fool with mean Negroes.

A shadow swung across the hillside. Shann's shoulders hunched, and he  cowered again. That terror he had known on the ledge was back in full  force as he waited for the beam to lick at him as it had earlier at his  fellows. The Throgs were on the hunt....          2. DEATH OF A SHIP      That sigh of displaced air was not as loud as a breeze, but it echoed  monstrously in Shann's ears. He could not believe in his luck as that  sound grew fainter, drew away into the valley he had just left. With  infinite caution he raised his head from his arm, still hardly able to  accept the fact that he had not been sighted, that the Throgs and their  flyer were gone.    But that black plate was spinning out into the sun haze. One of the  beetles might have suspected that there were Terran fugitives and  ordered a routine patrol. After all, how could the aliens know that they  had caught all but one of the Survey party in camp? Though with all the  Terran scout flitters grounded on the field, the men dead in their  bunks, the surprise would seem to be complete.    As Shann moved, Taggi and Togi came to life also. They had gone to earth  with speed, and the man was sure that both beasts had sensed danger. Not  for the first time he knew a burning desire for the formal education he  had never had. In camp he had listened, dragging out routine jobs in  order to overhear reports and the small talk of specialists keen on  their own particular hobbies. But so much of the information Shann had  thus picked up to store in a retentive memory he had not understood and  could not fit together. It had been as if he were trying to solve some  highly important puzzle with at least a quarter of the necessary pieces  missing, or with unrelated bits from others intermixed. How much control  did a trained animal scout have over his furred or feathered  assistants? And was part of that mastery a mental rapport built up  between man and animal?    How well would the wolverines obey him now, especially when they would  not return to camp where cages stood waiting as symbols of human  authority? Wouldn't a trek into the wilderness bring about a revolt for  complete freedom? If Shann could depend upon the animals, it would mean  a great deal. Not only would their superior hunting ability provide all  three with food, but their scouting senses, so much keener than his,  might erect a slender wall between life and death.    Few large native beasts had been discovered on Warlock by the Terran  explorers. And of those four or five different species, none had proved  hostile if unprovoked. But that did not mean that somewhere back in the  wild lands into which Shann was heading there were no heretofore  unknowns, perhaps slyer and as vicious as the wolverines when they were  aroused to rage.    Then there were the \"dreams,\" which had afforded the prime source of  camp discussion and dispute. Shann brushed coarse sand from his boots  and thought about the dreams. Did they or did they not exist? You could  start an argument any time by making a definite statement for or against  the peculiar sort of dreaming reported by the first scout to set ship on  this world.    The Circe system, of which Warlock was the second of three planets, had  first been scouted four years ago by one of those explorers traveling  solo in Survey service. Everyone knew that the First-In Scouts were a  weird breed, almost a mutation of Terran stock--their reports were rife  with strange observations.    So an alarming one concerning Circe (a yellow sun such as Sol) and her  three planets was not so rare. Witch, the world nearest in orbit to  Circe, was too hot for human occupancy without drastic and too costly  world-changing. Wizard, the third out from the sun, was mostly bare rock  and highly poisonous water. But Warlock, swinging through space between  two forbidding neighbors, seemed to be just what the settlement board  ordered.    Then the Survey scout, even in the cocoon safety of his well-armed ship,  began to dream. And from those dreams a horror of the apparently empty  world developed, until he fled the planet to preserve his sanity. There  had been a second visit to Warlock in check; worlds so well adapted to  human emigration could not be lightly thrown away. And this time there  was a negative report, no trace of dreams, no registration of any  outside influence on the delicate and complicated equipment the ship  carried. So the Survey team had been dispatched to prepare for the  coming of the first pioneers, and none of them had dreamed either--at  least, no more than the ordinary dreams all men accepted.    Only there were those who pointed out that the seasons had changed  between the first and second visits to Warlock. That first scout had  planeted in summer; his successors had come in fall and winter. They  argued that the final release of the world for settlement should not be  given until the full year on Warlock had been sampled.    But the pressure of Emigrant Control had forced their hands, that and  the fear of just what had eventually happened--an attack from the  Throgs. So they had speeded up the process of declaring Warlock open.  Only Ragnar Thorvald had protested that decision up to the last and had  gone back to headquarters on the supply ship a month ago to make a last  appeal for a more careful study.    Shann stopped brushing the sand from the tough fabric above his knee.  Ragnar Thorvald ... He remembered back to the port landing apron on  another world, remembered with a sense of loss he could not define. That  had been about the second biggest day of his short life; the biggest had  come earlier when they had actually allowed him to sign on for Survey  duty.    He had tumbled off the cross-continent cargo carrier, his kit--a very  meager kit--slung over his thin shoulder, a hot eagerness expanding  inside him until he thought that he could not continue to throttle down  that wild happiness. There was a waiting starship. And he--Shann Lantee  from the Dumps of Tyr, without any influence or schooling--was going to  blast off in her, wearing the brown-green uniform of Survey!    Then he had hesitated uncertainly, had not quite dared cross the few  feet of apron lying between him and that compact group wearing the same  uniform--with a slight difference, that of service bars and completion  badges and rank insignia--with the unconscious self-assurance of men who  had done this many times before.    But after a moment that whole group had become in his own shy appraisal  just a background for one man. Shann had never before known in his  pinched and limited childhood, his lost boyhood, anyone who aroused in  him hero worship. And he could not have put a name to the new emotion  that added so suddenly to his burning desire to make good, not only to  hold the small niche in Survey which he had already so painfully  achieved, but to climb, until he could stand so in such a group talking  easily to that tall man, his uncovered head bronze-yellow in the  sunlight, his cool gray eyes pale in his brown face.    Not that any of those wild dreams born in that minute or two had been  realized in the ensuing months. Probably those dreams had always been as  wild as the ones reported by the first scout on Warlock. Shann grinned  wryly now at the short period of childish hope and half-confidence that  he could do big things. Only one Thorvald had ever noticed Shann's  existence in the Survey camp, and that had been Garth.    Garth Thorvald, a far less impressive--one could say \"smudged\"--copy of  his brother. Swaggering with an arrogance Ragnar never showed, Garth was  a cadet on his first mission, intent upon making Shann realize the  unbridgeable gulf between a labor hand and an officer-to-be. He had  appeared to know right from their first meeting just how to make Shann's  life a misery.    Now, in this slit of valley well away from the domes, Shann's fists  balled. He pounded them against the earth in a way he had so often hoped  to plant them on Garth's smoothly handsome face, his well-muscled body.  One didn't survive the Dumps of Tyr without learning how to use fists,  and boots, and a list of tricks they didn't teach in any academy. He had  always been sure that he could take Garth if they mixed it up. But if he  had loosed the tight rein he had kept on his temper and offered that  challenge, he would have lost his chance with Survey. Garth had proved  himself able to talk his way out of any scrape, even minor derelictions  of duty, and he far out-ranked Shann. The laborer from Tyr had had to  swallow all that the other could dish out and hope that on his next  assignment he would not be a member of young Thorvald's team. Though,  because of Garth Thorvald, Shann's toll of black record marks had  mounted dangerously high and each day the chance for any more duty tours  had grown dimmer.    Shann laughed, and the sound was ugly. That was one thing he didn't have  to worry about any longer. There would be no other assignments for him,  the Throgs had seen to that. And Garth ... well, there would never be a  showdown between them now. He stood up. The Throg ship had disappeared;  they could push on.    He found a break in the cliff wall which was climbable, and he coaxed  the wolverines after him. When they stood on the heights from which the  falls tumbled, Taggi and Togi rubbed against him, cried for his  attention. They, too, appeared to need the reassurance they got from  contact with him, for they were also fugitives on this alien world, the  only representatives of their kind.    Since he did not have any definite goal in view, Shann continued to be  guided by the stream, following its wanderings across a plateau. The sun  was warm, so he carried his jacket slung across one"]]]
