FIRST. THE ABUSE OF LEGISLATIVE POWER BY MAN IN THE OPPRESSION OF WOMEN.    In some countries of Europe much of wrong is still done to woman, at  the present day, by old laws owing their existence to a past state of  things, and which have not yet been repealed or modified to suit  existing circumstances. But we are writing now to American women, and,  instead of the evils existing in the other hemisphere, we are looking  at a very different state of society. Let us confine ourselves,  therefore, to the subject as it affects ourselves.    To go into all the details which might be drawn together from the  statute books of the different States of the Union bearing on this  point, and to do them full justice, would require volumes. Such a  course is not necessary. The question can be decided with truth and  justice on general principles--on generally admitted facts. We admit,  then, that in some States--perhaps in all--there may be laws in which  the natural and acquired rights of woman have not been fairly  considered; that in some cases she has needed more legal protection and  more privileges than she has yet received. But while this admission is  made, attention is at the same time demanded for a fact inseparably  connected with it; namely, the marked and generous liberality which  American men have thus far shown in the considerate care and protection  they have, as a general rule, given to the interests of women. In no  country, whether of ancient or modern times, have women had less to  complain of in their treatment by man than in America. This is no  rhetorical declamation; it is the simple statement of an undeniable  fact. It is a matter of social history. Since the days of early  colonial life to the present hour--or, in other words, during the last  two hundred and fifty years--such has been the general course of things  in this country. The hardest tasks have been taken by man, and a  generous tenderness has been shown to women in many of the details of  social life, pervading all classes of society, to a degree beyond what  is customary even in the most civilized countries of Europe. Taking  these two facts together--that certain abuses still exist, that certain  laws and regulations need changing and that, as a general rule,  American women have thus far been treated by their countrymen with  especial consideration, in a legal and in a social sense--the inference  becomes perfectly plain. A formidable and very dangerous social  revolution is not needed to correct remaining abuses. Any revolution  aiming at upsetting the existing relations of the sexes--relations  going back to the earliest records and traditions of the race--can not  be called less than formidable and dangerous. Let women make full use  of the influences already at their command, and all really needed  changes may be effected by means both sure and safe--means already  thoroughly tried. Let them use all the good sense, all the information,  all the eloquence, and, if they please, all the wit, at their command  when talking over these abuses in society. Let them state their views,  their needs, their demands, in conscientiously written papers. Let them  appeal for aid to the best, the wisest, the most respected men of the  country, and the result is certain. Choose any one real, existing abuse  as a test of the honesty and the liberality of American men toward the  women of the country, and we all know before-hand what shall be the  result.[1]        {FOOTNOTE by SFC} [1] There is an injustice in the present law of  guardianship in the State of New York, which may be named as one of  those abuses which need reformation. A woman can not now, in the State  of New York, appoint a guardian for her child, even though its father  be dead. The authority for appointing a guardian otherwise than by the  courts is derived from the Revised statutes, p. 1, title 3, chapter 8,  part 2, and that passage gives the power to the father only. The mother  is not named. It has been decided in the courts that a mother can not  make this appointment--12 Howard's Practical Reports, 532. This is  certainly very unjust and very unwise. But let any dozen women of  respectability take the matter in hand, and, by the means already at  their command, from their own chimney-corners, they can readily procure  the insertion of the needful clause. And so with any other real abuse.  Men are now ready to listen, and ready to act, when additional  legislation is prudently and sensibly asked for by their wives and  mothers. How they may act when women stand before them, armed  CAP-A-PIE, and prepared to demand legislation at the point of the  bayonet, can not yet be known. {END FOOTNOTE}        If husbands, fathers, brothers, are ready any day to shed their heart's  blood for our personal defense in the hour of peril, we may feel  perfectly assured that they will also protect us, when appealed to, by  legislation. When they lay down their arms and refuse to fight for us,  it will then be time to ask them to give up legislation also. But until  that evil hour arrives let men make the laws, and let women be content  to fill worthily, to the very best of their abilities, the noble  position which the Heavenly Father has already marked out for them.  There is work to be done in that position reaching much higher, going  much farther, and penetrating far deeper, than any mere temporary  legislation can do. Of that work we shall speak more fully a moment  later.      SECONDLY. THE INALIENABLE NATURAL RIGHT OF WOMAN TO VOTE; AND  IMPERATIVELY SO IN A COUNTRY WHERE UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE IS A GREAT  POLITICAL PRINCIPLE.    This second proposition of the advocates of female suffrage is of a  general character. It does not point to particular abuses, it claims  the right of woman to vote as one which she should demand, whether  practically needed or not. It is asserted that to disqualify half the  race from voting is an abuse entirely inconsistent with the first  principles of American politics. The answer to this is plain. The  elective franchise is not an end; it is only a means. A good government  is indeed an inalienable right. Just so far as the elective franchise  will conduce to this great end, to that point it becomes also a right,  but no farther. A male suffrage wisely free, including all capable of  justly appreciating its importance, and honestly discharging its  responsibilities, becomes a great advantage to a nation. But universal  suffrage, pushed to its extreme limits, including all men, all women,  all minors beyond the years of childhood, would inevitably be fraught  with evil. There have been limits to the suffrage of the freest  nations. Such limits have been found necessary by all past political  experience. In this country, at the present hour, there are  restrictions upon the suffrage in every State. Those restrictions vary  in character. They are either national, relating to color, political,  mental, educational, connected with a property qualification, connected  with sex, connected with minority of years, or they are moral in their  nature.[2]        (FOOTNOTE by SFC} [2] In connection with this point of moral  qualification we venture to ask a question. Why not enlarge the  criminal classes from whom the suffrage is now withheld? Why not  exclude every man convicted of any degrading legal crime, even petty  larceny? And why not exclude from the suffrage all habitual drunkards  judicially so declared? These are changes which would do vastly more of  good than admitting women to vote. {END FOOTNOTE}        This restriction connected with sex is, in fact, but one of many other  restrictions, considered more or less necessary even in a democracy.  Manhood suffrage is a very favorite term of the day. But, taken in the  plain meaning of those words, such fullness of suffrage has at the  present hour no actual existence in any independent nation, or in any  extensive province. It does not exist, as we have just seen, even among  the men of America. And, owing to the conditions of human life, we may  well believe that unrestricted fullness of manhood suffrage never can  exist in any great nation for any length of time. In those States of  the American Union which approach nearest to a practical manhood  suffrage, unnaturalized foreigners, minors, and certain classes of  criminals, are excluded from voting. And why so? What is the cause of  this exclusion? Here are men by tens of thousands--men of widely  different classes and conditions--peremptorily deprived of a privilege  asserted to be a positive inalienable right universal in its  application. There is manifestly some reason for this apparently  contradictory state of things. We know that reason to be the good of  society. It is for the good of society that the suffrage is withheld  from those classes of men. A certain fitness for the right use of the  suffrage is therefore deemed necessary before granting it. A criminal,  an unnaturalized foreigner, a minor, have not that fitness;  consequently the suffrage is withheld from them. The worthy use of the  vote is, then, a qualification not yet entirely overlooked by our  legislators. The State has had, thus far, no scruples in withholding  the suffrage even from men, whenever it has believed that the grant  would prove injurious to the nation.    Here we have the whole question clearly defined. The good of society is  the true object of all human government. To this principle suffrage  itself is subordinate. It can never be more than a means looking to the  attainment of good government, and not necessarily its corner-stone.  Just so far is it wise and right. Move one step beyond that point, and  instead of a benefit the suffrage may become a cruel injury. The  governing power of our own country--the most free of all great  nations--practically proclaims that it has no right to"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/216"],[0,"The Tao Teh King, or the Tao and its Characteristics (#3)"],[1,"edure.'    2. Therefore the man of skill is a master (to be looked up to) by him  who has not the skill; and he who has not the skill is the helper of  (the reputation of) him who has the skill.  If the one did not honour  his master, and the other did not rejoice in his helper, an  (observer), though intelligent, might greatly err about them.  This is  called 'The utmost degree of mystery.'      28.    1.       Who knows his manhood's strength,     Yet still his female feebleness maintains;     As to one channel flow the many drains,     All come to him, yea, all beneath the sky.     Thus he the constant excellence retains;     The simple child again, free from all stains.       Who knows how white attracts,     Yet always keeps himself within black's shade,     The pattern of humility displayed,     Displayed in view of all beneath the sky;     He in the unchanging excellence arrayed,     Endless return to man's first state has made.       Who knows how glory shines,     Yet loves disgrace, nor e'er for it is pale;     Behold his presence in a spacious vale,     To which men come from all beneath the sky.     The unchanging excellence completes its tale;     The simple infant man in him we hail.    2. The unwrought material, when divided and distributed, forms  vessels.  The sage, when employed, becomes the Head of all the  Officers (of government); and in his greatest regulations he employs  no violent measures.      29. 1. If any one should wish to get the kingdom for himself, and to  effect this by what he does, I see that he will not succeed.  The  kingdom is a spirit-like thing, and cannot be got by active doing.  He  who would so win it destroys it; he who would hold it in his grasp  loses it.    2.       The course and nature of things is such that     What was in front is now behind;     What warmed anon we freezing find.     Strength is of weakness oft the spoil;     The store in ruins mocks our toil.    Hence the sage puts away excessive effort, extravagance, and easy  indulgence.      30. 1. He who would assist a lord of men in harmony with the Tao will  not assert his mastery in the kingdom by force of arms.  Such a course  is sure to meet with its proper return.    2. Wherever a host is stationed, briars and thorns spring up.  In the  sequence of great armies there are sure to be bad years.    3. A skilful (commander) strikes a decisive blow, and stops.  He does  not dare (by continuing his operations) to assert and complete his  mastery.  He will strike the blow, but will be on his guard against  being vain or boastful or arrogant in consequence of it.  He strikes  it as a matter of necessity; he strikes it, but not from a wish for  mastery.    4. When things have attained their strong maturity they become old.  This may be said to be not in accordance with the Tao: and what is not  in accordance with it soon comes to an end.      31. 1. Now arms, however beautiful, are instruments of evil omen,  hateful, it may be said, to all creatures.  Therefore they who have  the Tao do not like to employ them.    2. The superior man ordinarily considers the left hand the most  honourable place, but in time of war the right hand.  Those sharp  weapons are instruments of evil omen, and not the instruments of the  superior man;--he uses them only on the compulsion of necessity.  Calm  and repose are what he prizes; victory (by force of arms) is to him  undesirable.  To consider this desirable would be to delight in the  slaughter of men; and he who delights in the slaughter of men cannot  get his will in the kingdom.    3. On occasions of festivity to be on the left hand is the prized  position; on occasions of mourning, the right hand.  The second in  command of the army has his place on the left; the general commanding  in chief has his on the right;--his place, that is, is assigned to him  as in the rites of mourning.  He who has killed multitudes of men  should weep for them with the bitterest grief; and the victor in  battle has his place (rightly) according to those rites.      32. 1. The Tao, considered as unchanging, has no name.    2. Though in its primordial simplicity it may be small, the whole  world dares not deal with (one embodying) it as a minister.  If a  feudal prince or the king could guard and hold it, all would  spontaneously submit themselves to him.    3. Heaven and Earth (under its guidance) unite together and send down  the sweet dew, which, without the directions of men, reaches equally  everywhere as of its own accord.    4. As soon as it proceeds to action, it has a name.  When it once has  that name, (men) can know to rest in it.  When they know to rest in  it, they can be free from all risk of failure and error.    5. The relation of the Tao to all the world is like that of the great  rivers and seas to the streams from the valleys.      33. 1. He who knows other men is discerning; he who knows himself is  intelligent.  He who overcomes others is strong; he who overcomes  himself is mighty.  He who is satisfied with his lot is rich; he who  goes on acting with energy has a (firm) will.    2. He who does not fail in the requirements of his position, continues  long; he who dies and yet does not perish, has longevity.      34. 1. All-pervading is the Great Tao!  It may be found on the left  hand and on the right.    2. All things depend on it for their production, which it gives to  them, not one refusing obedience to it.  When its work is  accomplished, it does not claim the name of having done it.  It  clothes all things as with a garment, and makes no assumption of being  their lord;--it may be named in the smallest things.  All things  return (to their root and disappear), and do not know that it is it  which presides over their doing so;--it may be named in the greatest  things.    3. Hence the sage is able (in the same way) to accomplish his great  achievements.  It is through his not making himself great that he can  accomplish them.      35. 1. To him who holds in his hands the Great Image (of the invisible  Tao), the whole world repairs.  Men resort to him, and receive no  hurt, but (find) rest, peace, and the feeling of ease.    2. Music and dainties will make the passing guest stop (for a time).  But though the Tao as it comes from the mouth, seems insipid and has  no flavour, though it seems not worth being looked at or listened to,  the use of it is inexhaustible.      36. 1. When one is about to take an inspiration, he is sure to make a  (previous) expiration; when he is going to weaken another, he will  first strengthen him; when he is going to overthrow another, he will  first have raised him up; when he is going to despoil another, he will  first have made gifts to him:--this is called 'Hiding the light (of  his procedure).'    2. The soft overcomes the hard; and the weak the strong.    3. Fishes should not be taken from the deep; instruments for the  profit of a state should not be shown to the people.      37. 1. The Tao in its regular course does nothing (for the sake of  doing it), and so there is nothing which it does not do.    2. If princes and kings were able to maintain it, all things would of  themselves be transformed by them.    3. If this transformation became to me an object of desire, I would  express the desire by the nameless simplicity.       Simplicity without a name     Is free from all external aim.     With no desire, at rest and still,     All things go right as of their will.            PART II.      38. 1. (Those who) possessed in highest degree the attributes (of the  Tao) did not (seek) to show them, and therefore they possessed them  (in fullest measure).  (Those who) possessed in a lower degree those  attributes (sought how) not to lose them, and therefore they did not  possess them (in fullest measure).    2. (Those who) possessed in the highest degree those attributes did  nothing (with a purpose), and had no need to do anything.  (Those who)  possessed them in a lower degree were (always) doing, and had need to  be so doing.    3. (Those who) possessed the highest benevolence were (always seeking)  to carry it out, and had no need to be doing so.  (Those who)  possessed the highest righteousness were (always seeking) to carry it  out, and had need to be so doing.    4. (Those who) possessed the highest (sense of) propriety were (always  seeking) to show it, and when men did not respond to it, they bared  the arm and marched up to them.    5. Thus it was that when the Tao was lost, its attributes appeared;  when its attributes were lost, benevolence appeared; when benevolence  was lost, righteousness appeared; and when righteousness was lost, the  proprieties appeared.    6. Now propriety is the attenuated form of leal-heartedness and good  faith, and is also the commencement of disorder; swift apprehension is  (only) a flower of the Tao, and is the beginning of stupidity.    7. Thus it is that the Great man abides by what is solid, and eschews  what is flimsy; dwells with the fruit and not with the flower.  It is  thus that he puts away the one and makes choice of the other.      39. 1. The things which from of old have got the One (the Tao) are--       Heaven which by it is bright and pure;     Earth rendered thereby firm and sure;     Spirits with powers by it supplied;     Valleys kept full throughout their void     All creatures which through it do live     Princes and kings who from it get     The model which to all they give.    All these are the results of the One (Tao).    2.       If heaven were not thus pure, it soon would rend;     If earth were not thus sure, 'twould break and bend;     Without these powers, the spirits soon would fail;     If not so filled, the drought would parch each vale;     Without that life, creatures would pass away;     Princes and kings, without that moral sway,     However grand and high, would all decay.    3. Thus it is that dignity finds its (firm) root in its (previous)  meanness, and"]]]
