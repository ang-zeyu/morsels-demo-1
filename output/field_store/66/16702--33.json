The Irish bull that \"One man is as good as another and a great deal  better\" contains a truth, like many contradictions; a truth that was the  link between Christianity and citizenship. Alone of all superiors, the  saint does not depress the human dignity of others. He is not conscious  of his superiority to them; but only more conscious of his inferiority  than they are.    But while a million little priests and monks like mice were already  nibbling at the bonds of the ancient servitude, another process was  going on, which has here been called the weakening of the Empire. It is  a process which is to this day very difficult to explain. But it  affected all the institutions of all the provinces, especially the  institution of Slavery. But of all the provinces its effect was heaviest  in Britain, which lay on or beyond the borders. The case of Britain,  however, cannot possibly be considered alone. The first half of English  history has been made quite unmeaning in the schools by the attempt to  tell it without reference to that corporate Christendom in which it took  part and pride. I fully accept the truth in Mr. Kipling's question of  \"What can they know of England who only England know?\" and merely differ  from the view that they will best broaden their minds by the study of  Wagga-Wagga and Timbuctoo. It is therefore necessary, though very  difficult, to frame in few words some idea of what happened to the whole  European race.    Rome itself, which had made all that strong world, was the weakest thing  in it. The centre had been growing fainter and fainter, and now the  centre disappeared. Rome had as much freed the world as ruled it, and  now she could rule no more. Save for the presence of the Pope and his  constantly increasing supernatural prestige, the eternal city became  like one of her own provincial towns. A loose localism was the result  rather than any conscious intellectual mutiny. There was anarchy, but  there was no rebellion. For rebellion must have a principle, and  therefore (for those who can think) an authority. Gibbon called his  great pageant of prose \"The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.\" The  Empire did decline, but it did not fall. It remains to this hour.    By a process very much more indirect even than that of the Church, this  decentralization and drift also worked against the slave-state of  antiquity. The localism did indeed produce that choice of territorial  chieftains which came to be called Feudalism, and of which we shall  speak later. But the direct possession of man by man the same localism  tended to destroy; though this negative influence upon it bears no kind  of proportion to the positive influence of the Catholic Church. The  later pagan slavery, like our own industrial labour which increasingly  resembles it, was worked on a larger and larger scale; and it was at  last too large to control. The bondman found the visible Lord more  distant than the new invisible one. The slave became the serf; that is,  he could be shut in, but not shut out. When once he belonged to the  land, it could not be long before the land belonged to him. Even in the  old and rather fictitious language of chattel slavery, there is here a  difference. It is the difference between a man being a chair and a man  being a house. Canute might call for his throne; but if he wanted his  throne-room he must go and get it himself. Similarly, he could tell his  slave to run, but he could only tell his serf to stay. Thus the two slow  changes of the time both tended to transform the tool into a man. His  status began to have roots; and whatever has roots will have rights.    What the decline did involve everywhere was decivilization; the loss of  letters, of laws, of roads and means of communication, the exaggeration  of local colour into caprice. But on the edges of the Empire this  decivilization became a definite barbarism, owing to the nearness of  wild neighbours who were ready to destroy as deafly and blindly as  things are destroyed by fire. Save for the lurid and apocalyptic  locust-flight of the Huns, it is perhaps an exaggeration to talk, even  in those darkest ages, of a deluge of the barbarians; at least when we  are speaking of the old civilization as a whole. But a deluge of  barbarians is not entirely an exaggeration of what happened on some of  the borders of the Empire; of such edges of the known world as we began  by describing in these pages. And on the extreme edge of the world lay  Britain.    It may be true, though there is little proof of it, that the Roman  civilization itself was thinner in Britain than in the other provinces;  but it was a very civilized civilization. It gathered round the great  cities like York and Chester and London; for the cities are older than  the counties, and indeed older even than the countries. These were  connected by a skeleton of great roads which were and are the bones of  Britain. But with the weakening of Rome the bones began to break under  barbarian pressure, coming at first from the north; from the Picts who  lay beyond Agricola's boundary in what is now the Scotch Lowlands. The  whole of this bewildering time is full of temporary tribal alliances,  generally mercenary; of barbarians paid to come on or barbarians paid to  go away. It seems certain that in this welter Roman Britain bought help  from ruder races living about that neck of Denmark where is now the  duchy of Schleswig. Having been chosen only to fight somebody they  naturally fought anybody; and a century of fighting followed, under the  trampling of which the Roman pavement was broken into yet smaller  pieces. It is perhaps permissible to disagree with the historian Green  when he says that no spot should be more sacred to modern Englishmen  than the neighbourhood of Ramsgate, where the Schleswig people are  supposed to have landed; or when he suggests that their appearance is  the real beginning of our island story. It would be rather more true to  say that it was nearly, though prematurely, the end of it.          III    THE AGE OF LEGENDS      We should be startled if we were quietly reading a prosaic modern novel,  and somewhere in the middle it turned without warning into a fairy tale.  We should be surprised if one of the spinsters in _Cranford_, after  tidily sweeping the room with a broom, were to fly away on a broomstick.  Our attention would be arrested if one of Jane Austen's young ladies who  had just met a dragoon were to walk a little further and meet a dragon.  Yet something very like this extraordinary transition takes place in  British history at the end of the purely Roman period. We have to do  with rational and almost mechanical accounts of encampment and  engineering, of a busy bureaucracy and occasional frontier wars, quite  modern in their efficiency and inefficiency; and then all of a sudden we  are reading of wandering bells and wizard lances, of wars against men as  tall as trees or as short as toadstools. The soldier of civilization is  no longer fighting with Goths but with goblins; the land becomes a  labyrinth of faerie towns unknown to history; and scholars can suggest  but cannot explain how a Roman ruler or a Welsh chieftain towers up in  the twilight as the awful and unbegotten Arthur. The scientific age  comes first and the mythological age after it. One working example, the  echoes of which lingered till very late in English literature, may serve  to sum up the contrast. The British state which was found by Caesar was  long believed to have been founded by Brutus. The contrast between the  one very dry discovery and the other very fantastic foundation has  something decidedly comic about it; as if Caesar's \"Et tu, Brute,\" might  be translated, \"What, _you_ here?\" But in one respect the fable is quite  as important as the fact. They both testify to the reality of the Roman  foundation of our insular society, and show that even the stories that  seem prehistoric are seldom pre-Roman. When England is Elfland, the  elves are not the Angles. All the phrases that can be used as clues  through that tangle of traditions are more or less Latin phrases. And in  all our speech there was no word more Roman than \"romance.\"    The Roman legions left Britain in the fourth century. This did not mean  that the Roman civilization left it; but it did mean that the  civilization lay far more open both to admixture and attack.  Christianity had almost certainly come to Britain, not indeed otherwise  than by the routes established by Rome, but certainly long before the  official Roman mission of Gregory the Great. It had certainly been  largely swamped by later heathen invasions of the undefended coasts. It  may then rationally be urged that the hold both of the Empire and its  new religion were here weaker than elsewhere, and that the description  of the general civilization in the last chapter is proportionately  irrelevant. This, however, is not the chief truth of the matter.    There is one fundamental fact which must be understood of the whole of  this period. Yet a modern man must very nearly turn his mind upside down  to understand it. Almost every modern man has in his head an association  between freedom and the future. The whole culture of our time has been  full of the notion of \"A Good Time Coming.\" Now the whole culture of the  Dark Ages was full of the notion of \"A Good Time Going.\" They looked  backwards to old enlightenment and forwards to new prejudices. In our  time there has come a quarrel between faith and hope--which perhaps must  be healed by charity. But they were situated otherwise. They hoped--but  it may be said that they hoped for yesterday. All the motives that make  a man a progressive now made a man a conservative then.

To watch, teach, \"form\" little Flora would too evidently  be the making of a happy and useful life. It had been agreed between us  downstairs that after this first occasion I should have her as a matter  of course at night, her small white bed being already arranged, to that  end, in my room. What I had undertaken was the whole care of her, and  she had remained, just this last time, with Mrs. Grose only as an effect  of our consideration for my inevitable strangeness and her natural  timidity. In spite of this timidity--which the child herself, in the  oddest way in the world, had been perfectly frank and brave about,  allowing it, without a sign of uncomfortable consciousness, with the  deep, sweet serenity indeed of one of Raphael's holy infants, to be  discussed, to be imputed to her, and to determine us--I feel quite sure  she would presently like me. It was part of what I already liked Mrs.  Grose herself for, the pleasure I could see her feel in my admiration  and wonder as I sat at supper with four tall candles and with my pupil,  in a high chair and a bib, brightly facing me, between them, over bread  and milk. There were naturally things that in Flora's presence could  pass between us only as prodigious and gratified looks, obscure and  roundabout allusions.    \"And the little boy--does he look like her? Is he too so very  remarkable?\"    One wouldn't flatter a child. \"Oh, miss, MOST remarkable. If you think  well of this one!\"--and she stood there with a plate in her hand,  beaming at our companion, who looked from one of us to the other with  placid heavenly eyes that contained nothing to check us.    \"Yes; if I do--?\"    \"You WILL be carried away by the little gentleman!\"    \"Well, that, I think, is what I came for--to be carried away. I'm  afraid, however,\" I remember feeling the impulse to add, \"I'm rather  easily carried away. I was carried away in London!\"    I can still see Mrs. Grose's broad face as she took this in. \"In Harley  Street?\"    \"In Harley Street.\"    \"Well, miss, you're not the first--and you won't be the last.\"    \"Oh, I've no pretension,\" I could laugh, \"to being the only one. My  other pupil, at any rate, as I understand, comes back tomorrow?\"    \"Not tomorrow--Friday, miss. He arrives, as you did, by the coach, under  care of the guard, and is to be met by the same carriage.\"    I forthwith expressed that the proper as well as the pleasant and  friendly thing would be therefore that on the arrival of the public  conveyance I should be in waiting for him with his little sister; an  idea in which Mrs. Grose concurred so heartily that I somehow took  her manner as a kind of comforting pledge--never falsified, thank  heaven!--that we should on every question be quite at one. Oh, she was  glad I was there!    What I felt the next day was, I suppose, nothing that could be fairly  called a reaction from the cheer of my arrival; it was probably at the  most only a slight oppression produced by a fuller measure of the  scale, as I walked round them, gazed up at them, took them in, of my new  circumstances. They had, as it were, an extent and mass for which I had  not been prepared and in the presence of which I found myself, freshly,  a little scared as well as a little proud. Lessons, in this agitation,  certainly suffered some delay; I reflected that my first duty was, by  the gentlest arts I could contrive, to win the child into the sense of  knowing me. I spent the day with her out-of-doors; I arranged with her,  to her great satisfaction, that it should be she, she only, who might  show me the place. She showed it step by step and room by room and  secret by secret, with droll, delightful, childish talk about it and  with the result, in half an hour, of our becoming immense friends.  Young as she was, I was struck, throughout our little tour, with  her confidence and courage with the way, in empty chambers and dull  corridors, on crooked staircases that made me pause and even on the  summit of an old machicolated square tower that made me dizzy, her  morning music, her disposition to tell me so many more things than she  asked, rang out and led me on. I have not seen Bly since the day I left  it, and I daresay that to my older and more informed eyes it would now  appear sufficiently contracted. But as my little conductress, with her  hair of gold and her frock of blue, danced before me round corners and  pattered down passages, I had the view of a castle of romance inhabited  by a rosy sprite, such a place as would somehow, for diversion of the  young idea, take all color out of storybooks and fairytales. Wasn't it  just a storybook over which I had fallen adoze and adream? No; it was a  big, ugly, antique, but convenient house, embodying a few features of  a building still older, half-replaced and half-utilized, in which I had  the fancy of our being almost as lost as a handful of passengers in a  great drifting ship. Well, I was, strangely, at the helm!          II      This came home to me when, two days later, I drove over with Flora to  meet, as Mrs. Grose said, the little gentleman; and all the more for  an incident that, presenting itself the second evening, had deeply  disconcerted me. The first day had been, on the whole, as I have  expressed, reassuring; but I was to see it wind up in keen apprehension.  The postbag, that evening--it came late--contained a letter for me,  which, however, in the hand of my employer, I found to be composed but  of a few words enclosing another, addressed to himself, with a seal  still unbroken. \"This, I recognize, is from the headmaster, and the  headmaster's an awful bore. Read him, please; deal with him; but mind  you don't report. Not a word. I'm off!\" I broke the seal with a great  effort--so great a one that I was a long time coming to it; took the  unopened missive at last up to my room and only attacked it just before  going to bed. I had better have let it wait till morning, for it gave me  a second sleepless night. With no counsel to take, the next day, I  was full of distress; and it finally got so the better of me that I  determined to open myself at least to Mrs. Grose.    \"What does it mean? The child's dismissed his school.\"    She gave me a look that I remarked at the moment; then, visibly, with a  quick blankness, seemed to try to take it back. \"But aren't they all--?\"    \"Sent home--yes. But only for the holidays. Miles may never go back at  all.\"    Consciously, under my attention, she reddened. \"They won't take him?\"    \"They absolutely decline.\"    At this she raised her eyes, which she had turned from me; I saw them  fill with good tears. \"What has he done?\"    I hesitated; then I judged best simply to hand her my letter--which,  however, had the effect of making her, without taking it, simply put her  hands behind her. She shook her head sadly. \"Such things are not for me,  miss.\"    My counselor couldn't read! I winced at my mistake, which I attenuated  as I could, and opened my letter again to repeat it to her; then,  faltering in the act and folding it up once more, I put it back in my  pocket. \"Is he really BAD?\"    The tears were still in her eyes. \"Do the gentlemen say so?\"    \"They go into no particulars. They simply express their regret that it  should be impossible to keep him. That can have only one meaning.\"  Mrs. Grose listened with dumb emotion; she forbore to ask me what  this meaning might be; so that, presently, to put the thing with some  coherence and with the mere aid of her presence to my own mind, I went  on: \"That he's an injury to the others.\"    At this, with one of the quick turns of simple folk, she suddenly flamed  up. \"Master Miles! HIM an injury?\"    There was such a flood of good faith in it that, though I had not yet  seen the child, my very fears made me jump to the absurdity of the idea.  I found myself, to meet my friend the better, offering it, on the spot,  sarcastically. \"To his poor little innocent mates!\"    \"It's too dreadful,\" cried Mrs. Grose, \"to say such cruel things! Why,  he's scarce ten years old.\"    \"Yes, yes; it would be incredible.\"    She was evidently grateful for such a profession. \"See him, miss, first.  THEN believe it!\" I felt forthwith a new impatience to see him; it was  the beginning of a curiosity that, for all the next hours, was to deepen  almost to pain. Mrs. Grose was aware, I could judge, of what she had  produced in me, and she followed it up with assurance. \"You might as  well believe it of the little lady. Bless her,\" she added the next  moment--\"LOOK at her!\"    I turned and saw that Flora, whom, ten minutes before, I had established  in the schoolroom with a sheet of white paper, a pencil, and a copy of  nice \"round o's,\" now presented herself to view at the open door.  She expressed in her little way an extraordinary detachment from  disagreeable duties, looking to me, however, with a great childish  light that seemed to offer it as a mere result of the affection she had  conceived for my person, which had rendered necessary that she should  follow me. I needed nothing more than this to feel the full force of  Mrs. Grose's comparison, and, catching my pupil in my arms, covered her  with kisses in which there was a sob of atonement.    Nonetheless, the rest of the day I watched for further occasion to  approach my colleague, especially as, toward evening, I began to fancy  she rather sought to avoid me. I overtook her, I remember, on the  staircase; we went down together, and at the bottom I detained her,  holding her there with a hand on her arm. \"I take what you said to me at  noon as a declaration that YOU'VE never known him to be bad.\"    She threw back her head; she had clearly, by this time, and very  honestly, adopted an attitude. \"Oh, never known him--I don't pretend  THAT!\"    I was upset again. \"Then you HAVE known him--?\"    \"Yes indeed, miss, thank God!\"    On reflection I accepted"]]]
