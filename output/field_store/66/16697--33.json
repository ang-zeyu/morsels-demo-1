Here they encamped, and on the following morning the young men set out  by different ways in the direction of the mountain to hunt; but at night  they returned empty handed. Thus they hunted four days unsuccessfully.  Every day while his sons were gone the old man busied himself cutting  down saplings with his stone ax and building a house, and the daughters  gathered seeds, which constituted the only food of the family. As the  saplings were abundant and close to the camp, the old man built his  house fast, and had it finished at nightfall on the fourth day, when his  sons returned from their fruitless labors. They entered the lodge and  sat down. They were weary and hungry and their bodies were badly torn by  the thorns and thick copse of the mountains. Their father spoke not a  word to them as they entered; he did not even look at them; he seemed to  be lost in deep contemplation; so the young men said nothing, and all  were silent. At length the old man looked up and broke the silence,  saying, \"AqalÃ ni cactcini!\" (Welcome, my children.) \"Again you have  returned to the lodge without food. What does it avail that you go out  every day to hunt when you bring home nothing? You kill nothing because  you know nothing. If you had knowledge you would be successful. I pity  you.\" The young men made no reply, but lay down and went to sleep.    16. At dawn the old man woke them and said: \"Go out, my children, and  build a sweat-house, and make a fire to heat stones for the bath, and  build the sweat-house only as I will tell you. Make the frame of four  different kinds of wood. Put kaÃ§ (juniper) in the east, tse`isÃ§Ã¡zi  (mountain mahogany) in the south, Â¢estsÃ¬[n] (piÃ±on) in the west, and  awÃ¨tsal (cliff rose) in the north; join them together at the top and  cover them with any shrubs you choose. Get two small forked sticks, the  length of the forearm, to pass the hot stones into the sweat-house, and  one long stick to poke the stones out of the fire, and let all these  sticks be such as have their bark abraded by the antlers of the deer.  Take of all the plants on which the deer most like to browse and spread  them on the floor of the sweat-house, that we may sit on them.\" So they  built the lodge as he directed, and lit the fire and heated the stones.  While they were transferring the hot stones from the fire to the lodge  the old man brought out the mats which they used for bedding, and when  all the stones had been put in he hung the mats, one on top of another,  over the doorway. This done the three men went into the sudatory and sat  down to sweat, uttering not a word. When they had perspired sufficiently  they came out and sat down in silence until they were again ready to  submit themselves to the heat. In this way they sweated themselves four  times, keeping all the time a perfect silence, until they emerged for  the last time, when the old man directed his daughters to dig some soap  root and make a lather. In this he bade his sons wash their hair and the  entire surface of their bodies well. When they were thoroughly cleansed,  he sent them out to set twelve stone fall traps, a task which occupied  all the rest of the day. For each trap they buried a flat stone with its  upper side on a level with the surface of the ground; on this they  sprinkled a little earth, so that the rat would suspect nothing; over  this they placed another flat stone, leaning at an angle and supported  by a slender stick, to which were attached berries of the aromatic sumac  as a bait. That night the young men sat up very late talking with their  father, and did not lie down to sleep until after midnight, when, as  their father directed, they lay side by side with their heads to the  east.    17. The elder brother arose early, stirred the embers and made a fire,  and soon the younger awoke. As they sat by the fire warming themselves,  the elder one said: \"Younger brother, I had a dream in the night;  I dreamt I killed a buck deer.\" And the younger replied: \"Elder brother,  I, too, had such a dream, but that which I killed was a doe.\" The old  man heard their words and rose, saying, \"It is well, my children; go out  and try again.\" They went out to visit their traps. The first one they  came to had fallen; they lifted the stone and found under it the body of  a rat. So each one in turn, as they visited it was found to have fallen,  killing in its fall some small animal; and they returned to the lodge  with twelve little creatures for their food. Then the old man told them  to take their bows and arrows and hunt for deer. \"Hunt,\" said he, \"to  the east, the west, and the north, if you will, but do not pass to the  south of the lodge.\" With these instructions they set out, each one in a  different direction. The elder brother had not traveled far when he saw  a herd of deer and shot one of the number. He skinned it, cut it up,  took the backbone, hide, and tallow, and hung the rest in a tree. As he  drew near the house, he saw his younger brother approaching from a  different direction with the hide and meat of a doe. When they entered  the hut, the old man asked which of the two deer was shot first. The  elder brother answered: \"I think mine was, for I killed it early this  morning, soon after I left the house.\"    \"Well,\" said the father, \"this skin of the first slain is mine; go and  stretch it and dry it for me with care.\" After this they went out  hunting every day for twelve days, but fortune seemed to have deserted  them; they killed no more game; and at the end of that time their supply  of meat was exhausted. Then the old man said: \"It always takes four  trials before you succeed. Go out once more, and if you kill a deer do  not dress it, but leave it as it is.\"    18. On the following day they left the lodge together and did not take  separate trails. Soon they killed a deer, and the younger brother said:  \"What shall we now do with it, since our father has told us not to skin  it and not to cut it up?\" The elder brother said: \"I know not. Return to  the lodge and ask our father what we must do.\" Then the younger brother  returned to his father and the latter instructed him thus: \"Cut the skin  around the neck; then carefully take the skin from the head, so as to  remove the horns, ears, and all other parts, without tearing the skin  anywhere. Leave such an amount of flesh with the nose and lips that they  will not shrivel and lose their shape when they dry. Then take the skin  from the body, which skin will again be mine. One of you must take out  the pluck and carry that in the hide to me; the other will bring the  skin of the head and the meat. Let him who bears the pluck come in  advance, and stop not till he comes directly to me, and he must hand it  to me and to no one else.\" The younger brother went back and told all  this to the elder. They dressed the deer as they were bidden; the  younger put the pluck in the skin and went in advance, and the elder  followed with the venison and the skin of the head. When they reached  the hogÃ¡n, the father said: \"Where is the atcai?\" (pluck) and the  younger said: \"It is in the skin.\" \"Take it out,\" said the old man, \"and  hang it on yonder mountain mahogany.\" The young man did as he was  bidden. The father advanced with his bow and arrow and handed them to  the elder brother, who placed the arrow on the string and held the bow.  The old man put his hands on top of those of his son and together they  drew the bow. The former took careful aim at the pluck and let the arrow  fly. It struck the object and penetrated both heart and lungs so far  that the point protruded on the opposite side. Then the old man told his  son to seize the arrow by the point and draw it completely through,  which was done. Next he made his son stand close to the pluck, looking  towards it, and while his son was in this position he blew on him in the  direction of the pluck. \"Now,\" said the father, \"whenever you want to  kill a buck, even if there is neither track nor sign of deer in sight,  you have only to shoot into the tse`isÃ§Ã¡zi (mountain mahogany,  _Cercocarpus parvifolius_) and you will find a dead deer where your  arrow strikes; while if you wish to kill a female deer you will shoot  your arrow into the awÃ¨tsal (cliff rose, _Cowania mexicana_) and you  will find a doe there.\" When all this was done they prepared the skin of  the head, under the old man's directions. To keep the skin of the neck  open they put into it a wooden hoop.    They sewed up the mouth, left the eyeholes open, stuffed the skin with  hay, and hung it in a tree to dry, where it would not get smoky or  dusty. They cut places in the neck through which the hunter might see.  The skin of the doe which the younger brother had killed some time  before, and which had been tanned in the mean time, they painted red and  gray, to make it look like the skin of an antelope. They prepared two  short sticks, about the length of the forearm; these were to enable the  hunter to move with ease and hold his head at the proper height when he  crept in disguise on the deer. During the next four days no work was  done, except that the elder brother practiced in imitating the walk of  the deer.    19. From the camp where these things happened they moved to a place  called Tse`-lakÃ Ã¯-iÃ¡` (White Standing Rock). Before they went to hunt or  gather seeds, the old man desired that they should all help to build the  hogÃ¡n (hut); so all went to work together, men and women, and the hogÃ¡n  was completed, inside and outside, in four days.    20. The morning following the completion of the hogÃ¡n, the father sent  the young men out again, directing them, as before, not to go to the  south. They went off together, and soon espied a herd of deer. The elder  brother put on the deer mask and began to imitate the motions of the  animal, asking his"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20840"],[0,"Rebel Spurs (#3)"],[1," its owner, Hunt Rennie).    Escaped from a Mexican prison in 1847, believing his wife and the son he  had never seen to be dead, Hunt Rennie had gone west. In contrast to the  tragedy of his personal life, whatever Rennie had turned his hand to in  the new territory had prospered. A prospector he had grub-staked, found  the Oro Cruz, one of the richest mines in the Tubacca hills. Rennie owned  two freighting lines, one carrying goods to California, the other up from  Sonora. And his headquarters in the fertile Santa Cruz Valley was a ranch  which was also a fort, a fort even the Apaches avoided after they had  suffered two overwhelming defeats there.    That was Rennie's Range--cultivated fields, fruit orchards, _manadas_ of  fine horses. _Don_ Cazar supplied Tucson and the army posts with  vegetables and superb hams. He had organized a matchless company of Pima  Indian Scouts after the army pulled out in '61, had fought Apaches, but  had sided with neither Union nor Confederate forces. During the war years  he had more or less withdrawn within the borders of the Range, offering  refuge to settlers and miners fleeing Indian attacks. _Don_ Cazar was a  legend now, and a man did not quickly claim kinship with a legend.    \"Want a room, Kirby?\" Topham paused beside his table.    \"No. I have to stay close to the mare.\"    \"Yes. I can understand that. Kells is good with horses, so you needn't  worry. Ever raced that colt of yours?\"    \"Not officially.\" Drew smiled. There was that lieutenant with the supply  wagons. The man hadn't talked so loudly about Johnny Rebs after Shiloh  showed his heels to the roan the soldiers had bragged up.    \"This is a sporting town when the wagons come in, and they're due  tomorrow. Johnny Shannon just rode in to report. Might be some racing. You  aim to stay on in Tubacca?\"    \"Have to until Shadow can trail again. How's the prospect for a job?\"    \"With cattle--horses--teaming?\"    \"Horses, I guess.\"    \"Well, _Don_ Cazar--Rennie--runs the best _manadas_. You might hit him for  work. He'll be riding in to meet the wagons. Carmencita, did you bring all  that was left of the supplies?\" Topham's quizzical eyebrows lifted in  greeting to the waitress's loaded tray. \"I'd say, young man, that you are  facing a full-time job now, getting all that inside of you.\"    Drew ate steadily, consuming eggs and beans, tortillas, and fruit. Topham  joined three men at the next table, substantial town citizens, Drew  judged. The owner of the cantina raised his glass.    \"Gentlemen, I give you another successful trading trip!\"    \"Saw Johnny ride in,\" one of the men returned. \"Kid seems to be settlin'  down, ain't he? That ought to be good news for Rennie.\"    \"One believes in reformations when they are proven by time, _Senor_  Cahill,\" the man wearing rich but somber Spanish clothing replied.    \"It sure must go hard with a man to have his son turn out a wild one,\"  commented the third.    Drew's cup was at his lips, but he did not drink. Whose son? Rennie's?    \"No son by blood, that much comfort _Don_ Cazar has. But foster ties are  also strong. And the boy is still very young--\"    \"A rattler with only one button on the tail carries as much poison as a  ten-button one. Rennie ought to cut losses and give that kid the boot. The  way he's going he could involve Hunt in a real mess,\" Cahill said.    \"You are _Don_ Cazar's good friend, _Don_ Reese, his _compadre_ of many  years. Can you not do something?\"    \"_Don_ Lorenzo, all men have blind spots. And Johnny Shannon is Rennie's.  Bob Shannon helped free Hunt out of Mex prison in the war and was killed  doing it. Soon as Hunt set up here he sent for the boy and tried to give  him a father.\"    \"It is a great pity he has no child of his own blood. I have seen him  stand here in Tubacca giving toys and candy to the little ones. Yet he has  only this wild one under his roof, and perhaps that Juanito will break his  heart in the end....\"    Drew put down his cup. It was very hard not to turn and ask questions.  Dropping some coins on the table, he rose and started back to the stable,  to the world of Shiloh and Shadow where he was unable to betray Drew  Rennie. But there was so much Drew Kirby must learn--and soon!            2      Two lighted lanterns hung from pegs along the center of the stable, and  Callie had mounted a barrel to put up a third as Drew entered. There were  the soft peaceful sounds of horses crunching fodder, hoofs rustling in  straw. Shadow turned her head and nickered as Drew came up to her box  stall. She was answered by a blowing from Shiloh, a bray out of Croaker.    \"It's all right, girl--pretty lady--\" Drew fondled her mane, stroked the  satin-smooth arch of neck. Callie dropped from his barrel perch.    \"She sure is right purty, Mister Kirby. Mister Kells said as to tell you  he's sleepin' on a cot in th' tack room over there, should you be needin'  him.\" Callie pointed. \"Me, I'm beddin' down in the last stall. I put your  gear up right over here, so's you can hear if she gits to movin'--\"    \"Thanks.\" Drew felt in a pocket, tossed Callie the coin his fingers found.    The boy caught the piece, his eyes round as he looked at it. \"Lordy!  Thanks, Mister Kirby! You must be near as shiny as _Don_ Cazar--or Mister  Topham!\"    \"Shiny?\"    Callie laughed. \"Silver-shiny! Ain't too many men as goes round Tubacca  throwin' out good money thataway. 'Less it's ringin' down on th' bar, or  slidin' 'cross some table 'cause they found out as how they was holdin'  Jacks against some other fella's Kings. You want anything--you jus' holler,  Mister Kirby!\"    \"Mister?\" Drew thought he did not have the advantage of Callie by more  than four or five years.    \"Oh--Captain Kirby, maybe? Or Lieutenant? Johnny Shannon--now he was a  lieutenant with Howard's Rangers.\" Callie gave Drew a shrewd measuring  look.    \"Sergeant.\" Drew corrected automatically and then asked: \"How did you know  I'd been in the army?\"    \"Well, you wear them two shootin' irons army style, belted high an' butt  to front. Must use a flip-hand draw as do all th' hoss soldiers. Listen,  Mister Kirby, iffen you rode with th' Rebs, you better keep your lip  buttoned up when th' Blue Bellies hit town. There's been a pile of  fightin' an' folks is gittin' mad 'bout it--\"    \"Blue Bellies?\" Drew was wrenched back months, a year, by that old army  slang. \"Union troops stationed here?\" He had unconsciously tensed, his  body responding nerve and muscle to past training and alarms. But there  were no Yanks or Rebs any more, no riders or marchers in blue and  gray--just United States troops.    \"There's a garrison out to the Mesa camp. An' Cap'n Bayliss, he don't take  kindly to Rebs. You see, it's this way.... Out in th' breaks there's a  bunch of Rebs-leastways they claim as how they's Rebs--still holdin' out.  They hit an' run, raidin' ranches an' mines; they held up a coach a while  back. An' so far they've ridden rings round th' cap'n. Now he thinks as  how any Reb blowin' in town could be one of 'em, comin' to sniff out some  good pickin's. So anyone as can't explain hisself proper to th' cap'n gits  locked up out at camp till he can--\"    \"Trifle highhanded, ain't he?\"    \"Well, th' cap'n's for law an' order, an' he's army. But folks ain't  likin' it too much. So far he's been doin' it though.\"    Drew frowned. So even this far away from the scene of old battles the war  still smoldered; the black bitterness of defeat was made harder by the  victor. Drew's hand rubbed across the bulge beneath his shirt. In one  pocket of the money belt were his papers, among them the parole written  out in Gainesville which could prove he had ridden with General Forrest's  command, far removed from any Arizona guerrilla force. But to produce that  would change Drew Kirby to Drew Rennie, and that he did not want to do.    \"I rode with General Forrest, attached to General Buford's Scouts,\" he  said absently.    \"General Forrest!\" Callie glowed. \"Lordy, Mister Kirby, that's sure  somethin', it sure is! Only don't be sayin' that round Cap'n Bayliss  neither. He has him a big hate for General Forrest--seems like Bayliss was  a colonel once till th' General outsmarted him back east. An' there was a  big smoke-up 'bout it. They cut th' cap'n's spurs for him, an' he ended  th' war out here. Now he ain't no patient man; he's th' kind as uses his  hooks hard when he's ridin'.    \"You know, you sure can tell a lot 'bout a man when you give a look at his  hoss after he's come off th' trail. That there Shiloh colt o' yours, an'  this here lady hoss, an' that old mule ... anyone can see as how they's  always been handled nice an' easy. They ain't got no spite 'gainst nobody  as wants to rub 'em down an' give 'em a feed. But some hosses what git  brung in here--they's white-eyed an' randy, does you give 'em a straight  stare. For that there's always a reason. Mostly you can see what it is  when you look good an' steady at th' men who was ridin' 'em!\"    Drew laughed. \"Glad I passed your test, Callie. Guess I'll turn in now.  Been a long day travelin'--\"    \"Sure thing. An' from up there you can hear this little old mare, does she  need you.\"    The Kentuckian's pack had been hoisted into the mow, and Callie had even  humped up the fragrant hay to mattress his bedroll. A window was open to  the night, and as Drew stretched out wearily, he could hear the distant  tinkle of a guitar, perhaps from the Four Jacks. Somewhere a woman began  to sing, and the liquid Spanish words lulled him asleep.        He roused suddenly, his hand flashing under his head before he returned to  full consciousness, fingers tightening on the Colt he had placed there.  Not the mare--no--rather the pound of running feet and then a cry....    \"No, _senor_, no! _No es verdad_--it is not true! Teodoro, he meant no  harm--!\"    Drew scrambled to the window. Out in the alley below, three figures reeled  in the circle of light afforded by"]]]
