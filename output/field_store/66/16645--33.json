I have long  and personally known and admired the late Bishop Mac Donell; a worthier  or a better man never existed. The highest and the lowest alike loved  him.    I saw him bending under the weight of years, passed in his ministry and  in the defence of his adopted country, just before he left Canada, to  lay his bones in his natal soil, preside over the ceremony of placing  the first stone of the Catholic seminary, for which he had given the  ground and funds to the utmost of his ability.    He was a large, venerable-looking man, unwieldy from the infirmities of  age and a life of toil and trouble; and the affecting and touching  portion of the scene before us was to see him supported on his right and  left by the arms of a Presbyterian colonel and a colonel of the Church  of England.    This is true Christianity, true charity--peace be to his soul!--    His successor was a Canadian, equally free from pretension and bigotry;  and he was succeeded by an Irishman, whose mission is to heal the wounds  of party and strife. He is living and in office; I cannot, therefore,  speak of him; but, differing as an Englishman so widely as I do in  religious tenets from his, I can freely assert that, if clergymen of  every denomination pursued the same course of brotherly love that he  does, we should hear no more of the fierce and undying contention about  subjects which should be covered with the veil of benevolence and  humility.    You cannot force a man to think as you do, to draw him into what you  conceive to be the true path; mildness and conciliation are much more  likely to effect your object than the Emperor of China's yellow stick.  The days of the Inquisition, of Judge Jefferies, and of Claverhouse, are  happily gone by; and the artillery of man's wrath now vents its harmless  thunders much in the same way as the thunders of the Vatican, or the  recent fulmination of the Archbishop of Paris against the author of the  Wandering Jew; that is to say, with a great deal of noise, but without  much damnifying any one, as the public soon formed a true judgment of M.  Sue and of the tendency of his works.    On the other hand, how horrible it is, and what a fearful view of frail  human nature is opened for a searching mind to observe that a man, who  professes to have abandoned the pleasures of existence, to have broken  through the very first law of nature, to have separated himself from his  kind, and to have assumed perfection and infallibility, the attributes  of his Creator, devoting the altar at which he serves to the wicked  purposes of arraying man against man, and of embruing the hands held up  before him at prayer in the blood of his fellow-mortals!    But such is the inevitable tendency of the system of \"I am better than  thou,\" whether it be practised by a Catholic priest of the hedge-school,  by a fanatic bawler about new light, or by a fierce and uncompromising  churchman. Faith, hope, and charity, are alike misinterpreted and  misunderstood. Faith with these consists in blind or hypocritical  devotion to their peculiar opinions and dogmas; hope is limited to the  narrowest circle of ideas; and charity, Divine charity, exists not; for  even the very relics, the mouldering bones of the defunct, are not  allowed to rest side by side; and as to those differing in the slightest  degree from them, to them charity extends not, however pious, however  sincere, or however excellent they may be.    The people of England are very little aware how widely Roman Catholicism  extends in the United States and in Canada. From accurate returns, it  has been ascertained that in the United States there were last year  1,500,000, with 21 bishops, 675 churches, 592 mission stations, and 572  priests otherwise employed in teaching and travelling; 22 colleges or  ecclesiastical establishments, 23 literary institutions, 53 female  schools or convents for instruction, 84 charitable hospitals and  institutions, and 220 young students, preparing for the ministry; whilst  we learn, from the Annals of the Propaganda, that 1,130,000 francs were  appropriated, in May 1845, to the missions of America, or about L47,000  annually, of which the share for the United States, including Texas, was  771,164 francs, or about L32,000 in round numbers.    Then again, the greater portion of the Indian tribes in the north-west  and west, excepting near the Rocky Mountains or beyond them, are Roman  Catholics; and their numbers are very great, and all in deep hatred,  dislike, and enmity, to the Big Knives.    More than half a million of the Lower Canadians are also of the same  persuasion, and their church in Upper Canada is large and increasing by  every shipload from Ireland. Even in Oregon, a Catholic bishop has just  been appointed.    It is more than probable, that in and around the United States three  millions of Roman Catholic men are ever ready to advance the standard of  their faith; whilst Mexico, weak as it is, offers another Catholic  barrier to exclusive tenets of liberty, both of conscience and of  person.    It is surprising how very easily the emigrants are misled, and how  simply they fancy that, once on the shores of the New World, Fortune  must smile upon them.    There is a British society, as I have already stated, for mutual  protection, established at New York; and the government have agents of  the first respectability at Quebec, at Montreal, and at Kingston. But  the poorer classes, as well as those whose knowledge of life has been  limited, are sadly defrauded and deluded.    At a recent meeting of the Welsh Society at New York, facts were stated,  showing the depravity and audacity of the crimps at Liverpool and New  York. The President of the Society said that, owing to the nefarious  practices against emigrants, the Germans first, then the Irish, after  that the Welsh, and lastly the English residents of the city had taken  the matter in hand by the formation of Protective Societies.    The president of the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick observed that in  Liverpool the poor emigrants were fleeced without mercy; and he gave as  one instance a fact that, by the representations of a packet agent, a  large number of emigrants were induced to embark on board a packet  without the necessary supply of provisions, being assured that for their  passage-money they would be supplied by the captain--an arrangement of  which the captain was wholly ignorant.    The president of the Welsh Society exhibited sixty dollars of trash in  bills of the Globe Bank, that had been palmed off upon an unsuspecting  Welshman by some rascal in Liverpool, in exchange for his hoarded gold,  and declared that this was only one of a series of like villanies  constantly occurring.    The ex-president of the St. George's Society, Mr. Fowler, mentioned a  curious circumstance connected with the history of New York. He said  that he remembered the city when it contained only fifty thousand  inhabitants, and not one paved side walk, excepting in Dock Street. Now  it had a population of nearly 400,000, and had so changed, that he could  no longer identify the localities of his youthful days.    Who, he asked, had done this? The emigrant! and it was protection they  needed, not charity. He should have added, that the great mass of the  emigrants who have made New York the mighty city it now is, were Irish,  and that the native Americans have banded themselves in another form of  protection against their increasing influence.    The republican notions which the greater portion of the lower classes  emigrating from the old country have been drilled into, lead them to  believe that in the United States all men are equal, and that thus they  have a splendid vault to make from poverty to wealth, an easy spring  from a state of dependency to one of vast importance and consideration.  The simple axiom of republicanism, that a ploughman is as good as a  president, or a quarryman as an emperor, is taken firm hold of in any  other sense than the right one. What sensible man ever doubted that we  were all created in the same mould, and after the same image; but is  there a well educated sane mind in America, believing that a perfect  equality in all things, in goods and chattels, in agrarian rights and in  education, is, or ever will be, practicable in this naughty world?    Has nature formed all men with the same capacities, and can they be so  exactly educated that all shall be equally fit to govern?    The converse is true. Nature makes genius, and not genius nature. How  rarely she yields a Shakespeare!--There has been but one Homer, one  Virgil, since the creation. There was never a second Moses, nor have  Solomon's wisdom and glory ever again been attainable.    Look at the rulers of the earth, from the patriarchs to the present day,  how few have been pre-eminent! Even in the earliest periods, when the  age of man reached to ten times its present span, the wonderful sacred  writ records Tubal-Cain, the first artificer, and Jubal, the lyrist, as  most extraordinary men; and with what care are Aholiab and Bezabel,  cunning in all sorts of craft, and Hiram, the artificer of Tyre,  recorded! Hiram, the king, great as he undoubtedly was, was secondary in  Solomon's eyes to the widow's son.    These men, says the holy record, were gifted expressly for their  peculiar mission; and so are all men, to whom the Inscrutable has been  pleased to assign extraordinary talent.    Caesar, the conqueror, Napoleon, his imitator, and Nelson, and  Wellington, are they on a par with the rabble of New York? Procul, O,  procul este profani!    Pure democracy is an utter and unattainable impossibility; nature has  effectually barred against it. The only thing in the course of a life of  more than half a century that has ever puzzled me about it is, that the  Catholic clergy should, in so many parts of the world, have lent it a  helping hand.

If you don't get more than that, let your  outline be a finished and lovely diagram of the whole.    16. All the objects are then to be painted of their proper colors,  matching them as nearly as you can, in the manner that a missal is  painted, filling the outlined shapes neatly up to their junctions;  reenforcing afterwards when necessary, but as little as possible; but,  above all, knowing precisely what the light is, and where it is.[3]    [Footnote 3: Make a note of these points:    1. Date, time of day, temperature, direction and force of wind.    2. Roughly, by compass, the direction in which you are looking; and  angle of the light with respect to it.    3. Angle subtended by picture, and distance of nearest object in it.]    17. I have brought two old-fashioned colored engravings,[4] which are  a precise type of the style I want you to begin with. Finished from  corner to corner, as well as the painter easily could; everything done  to good purpose, nothing for vain glory; nothing in haste or  affectation, nothing in feverish or morbid excitement. The observation  is accurate; the sentiment, though childish, deep and pure; and the  effect of light, for common work, quite curiously harmonious and  deceptive.    [Footnote 4: From a \"Picturesque Tour from Geneva to Milan\" ...  engraved from designs by J. Lory of Neufchatel. London: Published by  R. Ackermann, at his Repository of Arts, 1820.]    They are, in spite of their weaknesses, absolutely the only landscapes  I could show you which give you a real idea of the places, or which  put your minds into the tone which, if you were happy and at ease,  they would take in the air and light of Italy.    I dwell on the necessity of completion especially, because I have lost  much time myself from my sympathy with the feverish intensity of the  minds of the great engravers; and from always fastening on one or two  points of my subject and neglecting the rest.    18. We have seen, then, that every subject is to be taken up first in  its terminal lines, then in its light and shade, then in its color.    First of the terminal lines of landscape, or of drawing in outline.    I think the examples of shell outline in your copying series must  already have made you feel the exact nature of a pure outline, the  difficulty of it, and the value.    But we have now to deal with limits of a more subtle kind.    The outline of any simple solid form, even though it may have complex  parts, represents an actual limit, accurately to be followed. The  outline of a cup, of a shell, or of an animal's limb, has a  determinable course, which your pen or pencil line either coincides  with or does not. You can say of that line, either it is wrong or  right; if right, it is in a measure suggestive, and nobly suggestive  of the character of the object. But the greater number of objects in a  landscape either have outlines so complex that no pencil could follow  them (as trees in middle distance), or they have no actual outline at  all, but a gradated and softened edge; as, for the most part, clouds,  foam, and the like. And even in things which have determinate form,  the outline of that form is usually quite incapable of expressing  their real character.    [Illustration]    19. Here is the most ordinary component of a foreground for instance,  a pleasantly colored stone. Any of its pure outlines are not only  without beauty, but absolutely powerless to give you any notion of its  character, although that character is in itself so interesting, that  here Turner has made a picture of little more than a heap of such  stones, with blue water to oppose their color. In consequence of these  difficulties and insufficiencies, most landscape-painters have been  tempted to neglect outline altogether, and think only of effects of  light or color on masses more or less obscurely defined. They have  thus gradually lost their sense of organic form, their precision of  hand, and their respect for limiting law; in a word, for all the  safeguards and severe dignities of their art. And landscape-painting  has, therefore, more in consequence of this one error than of any  other, become weak, frivolous, and justly despised.    20. Now, if any of you have chanced to notice at the end of my \"Queen  of the Air,\" my saying that in landscape Turner must be your only  guide, you perhaps have thought I said so because of his great power  in melting colors or in massing light and shade. Not so. I have always  said he is the only great landscape-painter, and to be your only  guide, because he is the only landscape-painter who can draw an  outline.    His finished works perhaps appear to you more vague than any other  master's: no man loses his outlines more constantly. You will be  surprised to know that his frankness in losing depends on his  certainty of finding if he chooses; and that, while all other  landscape-painters study from Nature in shade or in color, Turner  always sketched with the point.    \"Always,\" of course, is a wide word. In your copying series I have put  a sketch by Turner in color from Nature; some few others of the kind  exist, in the National Gallery and elsewhere. But, as a rule, from his  boyhood to the last day of his life, he sketched only with the fine  pencil point, and always the outline, more if he had time, but at  least the outline, of every scene that interested him; and in general,  outline so subtle and elaborate as to be inexhaustible in examination  and uncopiable for delicacy.    Here is a sketch of an English park scene which represents the average  character of a study from Nature by Turner; and here the sketch from  Nature of Dumblane Abbey for the _Liber Studiorum_, which shows you  what he took from Nature, when he had time only to get what was most  precious to him.    21. The first thing, therefore, you have to learn in landscape, is to  outline; and therefore we must now know precisely what an outline is,  how it ought to be represented; and this it will be right to define  in quite general terms applicable to all subjects.    We saw in the fifth Lecture[5] that every visible thing consisted of  spaces of color, terminated either by sharp or gradated limits.  Whenever they are sharp, the line of separation, followed by the point  of your drawing instrument, is the proper outline of your subject,  whether it represents the limits of flat spaces or of solid forms.    [Footnote 5: \"Lectures on Art, 1870,\" Sec. 130.]    22. For instance, here is a drawing by Holbein of a lady in a dark  dress, with bars of black velvet round her arm. Her form is seen  everywhere defined against the light by a perfectly sharp linear limit  which Holbein can accurately draw with his pen; the patches of velvet  are also distinguished from the rest of her dress by a linear limit,  which he follows with his pen just as decisively. Here, therefore, is  your first great law. Wherever you see one space of color  distinguished from another by a sharp limit, you are to draw that  limit firmly; and that is your outline.    23. Also, observe that as your representing this limit by a dark line  is a conventionalism, and just as much a conventionalism when the line  is subtle as when it is thick, the great masters accept and declare  that conventionalism with perfect frankness, and use bold and decisive  outline, if any.    Also, observe, that though, when you are master of your art, you may  modify your outline by making it dark in some parts, light in others,  and even sometimes thick and sometimes slender, a scientifically  accurate outline is perfectly equal throughout; and in your first  practice I wish you to use always a pen with a blunt point, which will  make no hair stroke under any conditions. So that using black ink and  only one movement of the pen, not returning to thicken your line, you  shall either have your line there, or not there; and that you may not  be able to gradate or change it, in any way or degree whatsoever.    24. Now the first question respecting it is: what place is your thick  line to have with respect to the limit which it represents--outside  of it, or inside, or over it? Theoretically, it is to be over it; the  true limit falling all the way along the center of your thick line.  The contest of Apelles with Protogenes consisted in striking this true  limit within each other's lines, more and more finely. And you may  always consider your pen line as representing the first incision for  sculpture, the true limit being the sharp center of the incision.    But, practically, when you are outlining a light object defined  against a dark one, the line must go outside of it; and when a dark  object against a light one, inside of it.    In this drawing of Holbein's, the hand being seen against the light,  the outline goes inside the contour of the fingers.    25. Secondly. And this is of great importance. It will happen  constantly that forms are entirely distinct from each other and  separated by true limits, which are yet invisible, or nearly so, to  the eye. I place, for instance, one of these eggs in front of the  other, and probably to most of you the separation in the light is  indiscernible. Is it then to be outlined? In practically combining  outline with accomplished light and shade there are cases of this kind  in which the outline may with advantage, or even must for truth of  effect, be omitted. But the facts of the solid form are of so vital  importance, and the perfect command of them so necessary to the  dignity and intelligibility of the work, that the greatest artists,  even for their finished drawings, like to limit every solid form by a  fine line, whether its contour be visible to the eye or not.    26. An outline thus perfectly made with absolute decision, and with a  wash of one color above it, is the most masterly of all methods of  light and shade study, with limited time, when the forms of the  objects to be"]]]
