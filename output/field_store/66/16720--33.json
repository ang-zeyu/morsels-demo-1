The sage would no doubt have looked grievously dull,  Had a pumpkin descended with force on his scull.  Of his folly then let us in future beware,  And believe that _such_ matters _are best as they are_:  Leave the manners and customs of oak trees alone,  Of acorns, and pumpkins--and look to our own.          [Illustration]    THE WOLF AND THE CRANE.      A wolf, once forgetting the size of his swallow,    Tried to pass a large marrow-bone through it.  \"Oh dear,\" said the beast, thinking death was to follow,    \"How careless and stupid to do it!\"    His mouth was propp'd open by means of the bone,    And his breathing was greatly impeded,  But a crane coming up, he contrived to make known    What kind of assistance he needed.    \"How d'ye do?\" said the bird; said the beast, \"Very ill,    For a bone has gone down the wrong way;  But if you can extract it by means of your bill,    The service I'll amply repay.\"    Thought the crane, \"I'm no surgeon: yet all must agree,    That my bill will make excellent _forceps_;  And as for the money, I do not now see    Why I need refuse taking his worship's.\"    Said the bird, \"It's agreed;\" said his patient, \"Proceed,    And take the bone hence, I beseech;\"  Which, after awhile, and with infinite toil,    The crane at last managed to reach.    \"Thank my stars!\" said the beast, from his terrors released,    \"Thank you _too_, sir,\" said he to the bird;  \"Alas!\" said the crane, \"is this all I'm to gain,    I was waiting the promised reward.\"    Said the wolf, \"You forget, I've contracted no debt,    Since the service was _rendered by me_;  Your head I releas'd from the jaws of a beast,    And now you're demanding a fee!\"      MORAL.    Give your help to a wolf, should he beg for your aid,  But you must not expect when you've done to be paid.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE DOG AND THE SHADOW.      A dog growing thinner, for want of a dinner,    Once purloined him a joint from a tray,  \"How happy I am, with this shoulder of lamb,\"    Thought the cur as he trotted away.    But the way that he took, lay just over a brook,    Which he found it was needful to cross;  So without more ado, he plunged in to go through,    Not dreaming of danger or loss.    But what should appear, in this rivulet clear,    As he thought upon coolest reflection,  But a cur like himself, who with ill-gotten pelf,    Had run off in that very direction.    Thought the dog, _a propos_! but that instant let go    (As he snatched at this same water-spaniel)  The piece he possess'd:--so with hunger distress'd    He slowly walk'd home to his kennel.      MORAL.    Hence, when we are needy, don't let us be greedy,    (Excuse me this line of digression,)  Lest in snatching at all, like the dog, we let fall    The good that we have in possession.          [Illustration]    THE TRAVELLERS AND THE BEAR.      Two trav'llers one morning set out from their home,  It might be from Sparta, from Athens, or Rome;  It matters not which, but agreed, it is said,  Should danger arise, to lend each other aid.    But scarce was this done, when forth rushing amain,  Sprung a bear from a wood tow'rds these travellers twain;  Then one of our heroes, with courage immense,  Climb'd into a tree, and there found his defence.    The other fell flat to the earth with dread,  When the bear came and smelt him, and thought he was dead;  So not liking the carcase, away trotted he,  When straight our brave hero descended the tree.    Then, said he, \"I can't think what the bear could propose,  When so close to your ear, he presented his nose.\"  \"Why this,\" said the other, \"he told me to do,  To beware for the future of cowards like you.\"      MORAL.    Those people who run from their friends in distress,  Will be left when _themselves_ are in trouble, I guess.          [Illustration]    THE FROGS AND THE BULL.      A Bull once treading near a bog,  Displaced the entrails of a frog,    Who near his foot did trust them;  In fact, so great was the contusion,  And made of his inwards such confusion,    No art could re-adjust them.    It chanced that some who saw his fate,  Did to a friend the deed relate,    With croakings, groans, and hisses;  \"The beast,\" said they, \"in size excell'd  All other beasts,\" their neighbors swell'd,    And ask'd, \"as large as this is!\"    \"Oh, larger far than that,\" said they,  \"Do not attempt it, madam, pray;\"    But still the frog distended,  And said, \"I'll burst, but I'll exceed,\"  She tried, and burst herself indeed!    And so the matter ended.      MORAL.    Should you with pride inflate and swell,  As did the frog: then who can tell!  Your sides may crack, as has been shown,  And we with laughing crack our own.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE COUNCIL OF MICE.      Some mice who saw fit, once a quarter to meet,    To arrange the concerns of their city;  Thought it needful to choose, as is common with us,    First a chairman, and then a committee.    When the chairman was seated, the object he stated    For which at that meeting they sat:  Which was, it should seem, the concerting a scheme    To defeat the designs of the cat.    Dr. Nibblecheese rose, and said, \"I would propose,    To this cat we fasten a bell;  He who likes what I've said, now will hold up his head;    He who does not, may hold up his tail.\"    So out of respect, they their noses erect,    Except one who the order reversed;  _Ayes_, all then but one, but yet nought could be done,    Until he had his reasons rehearsed.    \"I shall not,\" said this mouse, \"waste the time of the house,    In long arguments; since, as I view it,  The scheme would succeed without doubt, if indeed    We could find any mouse who would _do it_.\"    \"Hear! hear!\" was the cry, and \"no bells we will try,    Unless you will fasten them on;\"  So quite broken-hearted the members departed,    For the bill was rejected _nem. con._      MORAL.    Then be not too hasty in giving advice,  Lest your schemes should remind of the council of mice;  You had better delay your opinion a year,  Than put forth a ridiculous one, it is clear.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE WOLF AND THE LAMB.      A wolf and lamb once chanced to meet,  Beside a stream, whose waters sweet  Brought various kinds of beasts together,  When dry and sultry was the weather;  Now though the wolf came there to _drink_,  Of _eating_, he began to think,  As soon as near the lamb he came,  And straight resolved to kill the same;  Yet thought it better to begin,  With threat'ning words and angry mien.    \"And so,\" said he, to him below,  \"How dare you stir the water so?  Making the cool refreshing flood,  As brown as beer, and thick as mud.\"    \"Sir,\" said the lamb, \"that cannot be,  The water flows _from you to me_;  So, 'tis impossible, I think,  That what I do can spoil your drink.\"    \"I say it does, you saucy puss:  How dare you contradict me thus;  But more than this, you idle clack,  You rail'd at me behind my back  Two years ago, I have been told;\"  \"How so? I'm not a twelvemonth old,\"  The lamb replied; \"So I suspect  Your honor is not quite correct.\"    \"If not, your mother it must be,  And that comes all the same to me,\"  Rejoined the wolf--who waited not  But kill'd and ate him on the spot.      MORAL.    Some, like the wolf, adopt the plan,  To make a quarrel _if they can_;  But none with you can hold dispute,  If you're _determined_ to be mute;  For sure this proverb must be true,  That ev'ry _quarrel_ must have _two_.    [Illustration]          [Illustration]    THE BEASTS IN PARTNERSHIP.      This _firm_ once existed, I'd have you to know,  Messrs. Lion, Wolf, Tiger, Fox, Leopard, and Co.;  These in business were join'd, and of course 'twas implied,  They their stocks should unite, and the profits divide.    Now the fable relates, it so happened one day,  That their efforts combined, made a bullock their prey:  But agreed that the Lion should make the division,  And patiently waited the monarch's decision.    \"My friends,\" said the Lion, \"I've parted, you see,  The whole into six, which is right, you'll agree;  One part I may claim, as my share in the trade.\"  \"Oh, take it and welcome,\" they all of them said.    \"I claim too the second; since no one denies  'Twas my courage and conduct that gained you the prize:  And for the third; that you know is a fine  To the Lord of the manor, and therefore is mine.\"    \"Hey day!\" said the fox; \"Stop a bit,\" said the lion,  \"I have not quite done,\" said he, fixing his eye on  The other three parts; \"you are fully aware,  That, as _tribute_, one other part comes to my share.    \"And I think 'twould be prudent, the next to put by  Somewhere safe in _my_ den for a future supply,  And the other, you know, will but barely suffice,  To pay those expenses which always arise.\"    \"If this be the case,\" said the fox, \"I discern  That the business to _us_ is a losing concern;  If so to withdraw, I should think would be best;\"  \"Oh, yes! let us break up the firm,\" said the rest;    And so:--for you may not have heard of it yet,--  It was quickly dissolved, though not in _the gazette_.      MORAL.    Some folks in their dealings, like him in the fable,  Will take others' shares, if they think they are able;  But let them not wonder who act in this way,  If they find none will join them in business or play.

A lion, with the heat oppress'd,  One day composed himself to rest;  But whilst he dozed, as he intended,  A mouse his royal back ascended;  Nor thought of harm as Esop tells,  Mistaking him for something else,  And travelled over him, and round him,  And might have left him as he found him,  Had he not, tremble when you hear,  Tried to explore the monarch's ear!

When the correspondence opens he is a candidate for the  praetorship, which he obtained without difficulty, at the head of the  poll. But his birth might still be a bar to the consulship. His father,  M. Tullius, lived at Arpinum, an ancient city of the Volscians and  afterwards of the Samnites, which had long enjoyed a partial, and from  B.C. 188 a complete, Roman franchise, and was included in the Cornelian  tribe. Cicero's mother's name was Helvia, of whom we know nothing but  the one anecdote told by Quintus (_Fam._ xvi. 26), who says that she  used to seal the wine jars when they were emptied, so that none might be  drained without her knowing it--a testimony to her economy and careful  housewifery. His father had weak health and resided almost entirely in  his villa at Arpinum, which he had considerably enlarged, much devoted  to study and literature (_de Leg._ ii. 1). But though he apparently  possessed considerable property, giving him equestrian rank, and though  Cicero says that his family was very ancient, yet neither he nor any of  his ancestors had held Roman magistracies. Marcus and his brother  Quintus were the first of their family to do so, and both had to depend  on character and ability to secure their elections. But though the  father did nothing for his sons by holding curule office himself, he did  the best for their education that was possible. Cicero calls him  _optimus et prudentissimus_, and speaks with gratitude of what he had  done for his sons in this respect. They were sent early to Rome to the  house of C. Aculeo, a learned jurisconsult, married to a sister of  Helvia; and attended--with their cousins, the sons of Aculeo--the best  schools in the city.[2] The young Marcus shewed extraordinary ability  from the first, and that avidity for reading and study which never  forsook him. As a young man he diligently attended the chambers of  renowned jurisconsults, especially those of the elder and younger  Scaevola, Crassus, and Antonius, and soon found that his calling in life  was oratory. It was not till he was twenty-eight years old,  however--when he had already written much and pleaded many cases--that  he went on a visit of between two and three years to Greece, Asia, and  Rhodes, to study in the various schools of rhetoric and philosophy, and  to view their famous cities (B.C. 79-77). It was after his return from  this tour that his age (he was now thirty-one) made the seeking of  office at Rome possible. From that time his election to the several  offices--quaestorship, aedileship, praetorship, consulship--followed  without any repulse, each in the first year of his age at which he was  legally capable of being elected.    He had doubtless made the acquaintance of Titus Pomponius, afterwards  called Atticus, early in life. But it seems that it was their intimacy  at Athens (B.C. 79), where Atticus, who was three years his senior, had  been residing for several years, that began the very close and warm  friendship which lasted with nothing but the slightest and most passing  of clouds till his death. His brother Quintus was married to Pomponia, a  sister of Atticus; but the marriage turned out unfortunately, and was a  strain upon the friendship of Cicero and Atticus rather than an  additional bond. This source of uneasiness meets us in the very first  letter of the correspondence, and crops up again and again till the  final rupture of the ill-assorted union by divorce in B.C. 44. Nothing,  however, had apparently interrupted the correspondence of the two  friends, which had been going on for a long time before the first letter  which has been preserved.    [Sidenote: Cicero the successful Advocate.]    [Sidenote: Death of Cicero's Father.]    The eleven letters, then, which date before the consulship, shew us  Cicero in full career of success as an advocate and rising official,  not as yet apparently much interested in party politics, but with his  mind, in the intervals of forensic business, engaged on the adornment of  the new villa at Tusculum, the first of the numerous country residences  which his growing wealth or his heightened ideas of the dignity of his  position prompted him to purchase. Atticus is commissioned to search in  Athens and elsewhere for objects of art suitable for the residence of a  wealthy Roman, who at the same time was a scholar and man of letters. He  is beginning to feel the charm of at any rate a temporary retreat from  the constant bustle and occupations of the city. Though Cicero loved  Rome, and could hardly conceive of life unconnected with its business  and excitements,[3] and eagerly looked for news of the city in his  absence, yet there was another side to his character. His interest in  literature and philosophy was quite as genuine as his interest in the  forum and senate-house. When the season came for temporarily withdrawing  from the latter, he returned to the former with eager passion. But  Tusculum was too near Rome to secure him the quiet and solitude  necessary for study and composition. Thus, though he says (vol. i., p.  4), \"I am so delighted with my Tusculan villa that I never feel really  happy till I get there,\" he often found it necessary, when engaged in  any serious literary work, to seek the more complete retirement of  Formiae, Cumae, or Pompeii, near all of which he acquired properties,  besides an inheritance at Arpinum.[4] But the important achievements in  literature were still in the future. The few letters of B.C. 68-67 are  full of directions to Atticus for the collection of books or works of  art suitable to his house, and of matters of private interest. They are  also short and sometimes abrupt. The famous allusion to his father's  death in the second letter of this collection, contained in a single  line--_pater nobis decessit a.d. 111 Kal. Decembris_--followed by  directions to Atticus as to articles of _vertu_ for his villa, has much  exercised the minds of admirers, who do not like to think Cicero capable  of such a cold-hearted sentence. It is certainly very unlike his usual  manner.[5] He is more apt to exaggerate than understate his emotions;  and in the first letter extant he speaks with real feeling of the death  of a cousin. Elsewhere--as we have seen--he refers to his father with  respect and gratitude. How then are we to account for such a cold  announcement? Several expedients have been hit upon. First, to change  _decessit_ to _discessit_, and to refer the sentence to the father's  quitting Rome, and not life; in which case it is not easy to see why the  information is given at all. Second, to suppose it to be a mere answer  to a request for the information on the part of Atticus; in which case  the date must refer to some previous year, or the letter must be placed  considerably later, to allow of time for Atticus to hear of the death  and to write his question. In favour of the first is the fact that  Asconius (Sec. 82) says that Cicero lost his father when he was a candidate  for the consulship (B.C. 64). Some doubt has been thrown upon the  genuineness of the passage in Asconius; and, if that is not trustworthy,  we have nothing else to help us. On the whole I think we must leave the  announcement as it stands in all its baldness. Cicero's father had long  been an invalid, and Atticus may have been well aware that the end was  expected. He would also be acquainted with the son's feelings towards  his father, and Cicero may have held it unnecessary to enlarge upon  them. It is possible, too, that he had already written to tell Atticus  of the death and of his own feelings, but had omitted the date, which he  here supplies. Whatever may be the true explanation--impossible now to  recover--everything we know of Cicero forbids us to reckon insensibility  among his faults, or reserve in expressing his feelings among his  characteristics.    [Sidenote: The Praetorship, B.C. 66.]    In the next year (B.C. 67) we find Cicero elected to the praetorship,  after at least two interruptions to the _comitia_, which, though not  aimed at himself, gave him a foretaste of the political troubles to come  a few years later. He is, however, at present simply annoyed at the  inconvenience, not yet apprehensive of any harm to the constitution. The  double postponement, indeed, had the effect of gratifying his vanity:  for his own name was returned three times first of the list of eight.  His praetorship (B.C. 66) passed without any startling event. The two  somewhat meagre letters which remain belonging to this year tell us  hardly anything. Still he began more or less to define his political  position by advocating the _lex Manilia_, for putting the Mithridatic  war into the hands of Pompey; and one of his most elaborate forensic  speeches--that for Cluentius--was delivered in the course of the year:  in which also his brother Quintus was elected to the aedileship.    [Sidenote: B.C. 65-64. Preparations for the Consulship.]    So far Cicero had risen steadily and without serious difficulty up the  official ladder. But the stress was now to come. The old families seem  not to have been so ready to oppose the rise of the _novus homo_ to the  praetorship. It was the consulship on which they tried to keep a tight  hand. Accordingly, immediately after the year of his praetorship, we find  him anxiously looking out for support and inquiring who are likely to be  his competitors. The interesting point in regard to this is his  connexion with Catiline. In his speech in the senate delivered in the  following year (_in toga candida_, B.C. 64) he denounced Catiline in the  most violent language, accusing him of every conceivable crime; yet in  B.C. 65 he not only contemplated being elected with him without any  expression of disgust, but even considered whether he should not  undertake his defence on some charge that was being brought against  him--perhaps for his conduct during the Sullan"]]]
