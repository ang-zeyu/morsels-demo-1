Thin slide  blocks kivvered de peepholes in de rough plank doors. Dey had to have  dem peepholes so as dey could see who was at de door 'fore dey opened  up. Dem old stack chimblies what was made out of sticks and red clay,  was all time gittin' on fire. Dem old home-made beds had high posties  and us called 'em 'teesters.' To take de place of springs, what hadn't  never been seen 'round dar in dem days, dey wove heavy cords lengthways  and crostways. Over dem cords dey laid a flat mat wove out of white oak  splints and on dat dey put de homespun bed ticks stuffed wid wheat  straw. Dey could have right good pillows if dey was a mind to pick de  scrap cotton and fix it up, but dere warn't many of 'em keered dat much  'bout no pillows.    \"Slaves didn't do no cookin' on our place 'cause Marster fed evvybody up  at de big house. Missy, I ain't never gwine to forgit dat big old  fireplace up dar. Dey piled whole sticks of cord wood on it at one time,  wid little sticks crossways under 'em and, let me tell you, dat was a  fire what would cook anything and evvything. De pots hung on swingin'  racks, and dere was big ovens, little ovens, long-handled fryin' pans,  and heavy iron skillets wid tight, thick lids. It sho' was a sight de  way us chillun used to make 'way wid dem ash-roasted 'taters and dat  good, fresh butter. Us chillun had to eat supper early 'cause all  chillun had to be in bed 'fore dark. It warn't lak dese days. Why Missy,  chilluns now stays up 'most all night runnin' 'round dese parts.    \"Marster was sho' good 'bout seein' dat his Niggers had plenty to eat  and wear. For supper us et our bread and milk wid wooden spoons out of  wooden bowls, but for dinner dey give us veg'ables, corn pone, and  'taters. Marster raised all de sorts of veg'ables what dey knowed  anything 'bout in dem days, and he had big old fields of wheat, rye,  oats, and corn, 'cause he 'lowed dat stock had to eat same as folkses.  Dere was lots of chickens, turkeys, cows, hogs, sheep, and some goats on  dat plantation so as dere would allus be plenty of meat for evvybody.    \"Our Marster evermore did raise de cotton--lots of it to sell, and  plenty for clothes for all de folkses, white and black, what lived on  his place. All de cloth was home-made 'cept de calico for de best Sunday  dresses. Chillun had to spin de thread and deir mammies wove de cloth.  'Fore de end of de war, whilst I was still so little I had to stand on a  box to reach de spinnin' wheel good, I could spin six reels a day.    \"Chillun was happy when hog-killin' time come. Us warn't 'lowed to help  none, 'cept to fetch in de wood to keep de pot bilin' whar de lard was  cookin'. Our Mist'ess allus had de lard rendered in de bigges' washpot,  what dey sot on rocks in de fireplace. Us didn't mind gittin' de wood  for dat, 'cause when dem cracklin's got done, dey let us have all us  could eat and, jus' let me tell you, Missy, you ain't never had nothin'  good 'less you has et a warm skin cracklin' wid a little salt. One time  when dey was renderin' lard, all us chillun was crowdin' 'round close as  us could git to see which one could git a cracklin' fust. Mist'ess told  us to stand back 'fore somebody got burnt; den Mammy said she was gwine  to take de hides off our backs 'bout gittin' so close to dat fire, and  'bout dat time somebody 'hind me gimme a quick push; and in de fire I  went. Marster grabbed me 'most time I hit dem red coals, but one hand  and arm was burnt so bad I had to wear it in a sling for a long time.  Den Marster laid down de law and told us what he would do if he cotch us  chillun hangin' 'round de fire whar dey was cookin' lard again.    \"Folkses said our Marster must have a powerful sweet tooth on account of  he kept so many bee hives. When bees swarmed folkses rung bells and beat  on tin pans to git 'em settled. Veils was tied over deir haids to keep  de bees from gittin' to deir faces when dey went to rob de hives.  Chillun warn't never 'lowed to be nowhar nigh durin' dat job. One day I  sneaked out and got up close to see how dey done it, and dem bees got  all over me. Dey stung me so bad I couldn't see for days and days.  Marster, he jus' fussed and said dat gal, Cordelia, she was allus whar  she didn't b'long. Missy, I ain't never wanted to fool wid no more bees,  and I don't even lak honey no more.    \"Slaves all went to church wid deir white folkses 'cause dere warn't no  Nigger churches dem days. All de preachin' was done by white preachers.  Churches warn't nigh and convenient dem days lak dey is now and dey was  such a fur piece from de plantations dat most of de folkses stayed all  day, and dem meetin' days was big days den. De cooks was told to fix de  bestes' dinners dey could git up, and chillun was made to know dey had  better mind what dey was 'bout when dey was in de meetin' house or it  was gwine to be made mighty hot for 'em when dey got back home. Dat was  one thing our Marster didn't 'low no foolin' 'bout. His Niggers had to  be-have deyselfs at de meetin' house. 'Long 'bout August when craps was  laid by, dey had brush arbor meetin's. White folks brought deir slaves  and all of 'em listened to a white preacher from Watkinsville named Mr.  Calvin Johnson. Dere was lots of prayin' and shoutin' at dem old brush  arbor 'vival meetin's.    \"Dey had campmeetin's too. De old Freeman place was whar dey had some of  dem fust campmeetin's, and Hillsboro, Mars Hill, and Bethabara was some  of de other places whar Marster tuk us to campmeetin's. Missy, you jus'  don't know nothin' 'bout 'citement if you ain't never been to one of dem  old-time campmeetin's. When folkses would git 'ligion dey would holler  and shout a-testifyin' for de Lord. Atter de meetin' dey dammed up de  crick and let it git deep enough for de baptizin'. Dey dipped de white  folkses fust, and den de Niggers. You could hear 'em singin' a mile away  dem old songs lak: _On Jordan's Stormy Banks I Stand_,--_Roll, Jordan  Roll_,--_All God's Chilluns is a-goin' Home_, and--_Whar de Livin'  Waters Flow_. I jus' can't 'member half of dem good old songs 'cause my  mem'ry ain't good as it used to be.\" Here Cordelia paused. She seemed  oblivious to all around her for several minutes, and then she suddenly  smiled. \"Lordy, Missy,\" she began, \"if I could jus' call back dem days  wid our good old Marster to look atter us and see dat us had what us  needed to eat and wear and a good comf'table cabin to live in, wouldn't  dis be a happy old 'oman? Lots of de other old folks would lak it too,  'cause our white folkses day sho' did take good keer of deir slaves.    \"Did you ever hear of dem logrollin's? On our place dey spent 'bout two  whole days cookin' and gittin' ready. Marster axed evvybody from fur and  nigh, and dey allus come 'cause dey knowed he was gwine to give 'em a  good old time. De way dey rolled dem logs was a sight, and de more good  corn liquor Marster passed 'round, de faster dem logs rolled. Come  night-time, Marster had a big bonfire built up and sot lots of pitchpine  torches 'round so as dere would be plenty of light for 'em to see how to  eat dat fine supper what had done been sot out for 'em. Atter supper,  dey danced nigh all de rest of de night. Mammy used to tell us 'bout de  frolics next day, 'cause us chillun was made to go to bed at sundown.  Come day, go day, no matter what might happen, growin' chillun had to be  in bed at deir reg'lar time, but Mammy never forgot to tell us all 'bout  de good times next day.    \"Mammy said dem cornshuckin's meant jus' as much fun and jollification  as wuk. Dey gathered Marster's big corn crap and 'ranged it in long,  high piles, and sometimes it tuk sev'ral days for dem cornshuckers to  git it all shucked, but evvybody stayed right dar on de job 'til it was  finished. At night, dey wukked by de light of big fires and torches, den  dey had de big supper and started dancin'. Dey stopped so often to swig  dat corn liquor Marster pervided for 'em dat 'fore midnight folkses  started fallin' out and drappin' down in de middle of de dance ring. De  others would git 'em by de heels and drag 'em off to one side 'til dey  come to and was ready to drink more liquor and dance again. Dat was de  way dey went on de rest of de night.    \"Corpses! Buryin's! Graveyards! Why, Miss, dere warn't nigh so many  folkses a-dyin' all de time dem days as dere is now. Folkses lived right  and was tuk better keer of and dere warn't so much reason for 'em to die  out den. When somebody did die, folkses come from miles and miles around  to de buryin'. Dey give de slaves de same sort of funerals de white  folkses had. De corpses was washed good all over wid hot water and  home-made soap, den dey was dressed and laid out on de coolin' boards  'til de cyarpenter man had time to make up de coffins. Lordy, Missy,  ain't you never seed no coolin' board? I 'spects dey is all gone now  though. Dey looked a good deal lak ironin' boards, only dey had laigs to  stand on. Lots of times dey didn't dress de corpses, but jus' wropped  'em in windin' sheets. Dem home-made, pine coffins didn't look so bad  atter dey got 'em painted up and lined nice. Dey driv de wagon what had  de corpse on it right slow to de graveyard. De preacher talked a little  and prayed; den atter de mourners had done sung somepin on de order of  _Harps [HW: Hark?] From De Tomb_, dey shovelled in de dirt over de  coffin whilst de preacher said comfortin' words to de fambly of de daid.  Evvy plantation had its own graveyard wid a fence around it, and dere  was a place in it for de slaves 'nigh whar deir white folks was buried.    \"Honey, didn't you never hear tell of Dr. Frank Jackson? He was sho' a  grand doctor. Dr. Jackson made up his own medicines and toted 'em 'round  wid him all de time. He was close kin to our Marse Andy Jackson's  fambly. All dem Jacksons down in 'Conee was good white folks.    \"Us"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18500"],[0,"The Complete Works of Robert Burns: Containing his Poems, Songs, and (#3)"],[1,"Blooming Nelly    The day returns, my bosom burns    My Love she's but a lassie yet    Jamie, come try me    Go fetch to me a Pint O' Wine    The Lazy Mist    O mount and go    Of a' the airts the wind can blaw    Whistle o'er the lave o't    O were I on Parnassus' Hill    \"There's a youth in this city\"    My heart's in the Highlands    John Anderson, my Jo    Awa, Whigs, awa    Ca' the Ewes to the Knowes    Merry hae I been teethin' a heckle    The Braes of Ballochmyle    To Mary in Heaven    Eppie Adair    The Battle of Sherriff-muir    Young Jockey was the blithest lad    O Willie brewed a peck o' maut    The braes o' Killiecrankie, O    I gaed a waefu' gate yestreen    The Banks of Nith    Tam Glen    Frae the friends and land I love    Craigie-burn Wood    Cock up your Beaver    O meikle thinks my luve o' my beauty    Gudewife, count the Lawin    There'll never be peace till Jamie comes hame    The bonnie lad that's far awa    I do confess thou art sae fair    Yon wild mossy mountains sae lofty and wide    It is na, Jean, thy bonnie face    When I think on the happy days    Whan I sleep I dream    \"I murder hate by field or flood\"    O gude ale comes and gude ale goes    Robin shure in hairst    Bonnie Peg    Gudeen to you, Kimmer    Ah, Chloris, since it may na be    Eppie M'Nab    Wha is that at my bower-door    What can a young lassie do wi' an auld man    Bonnie wee thing, cannie wee thing    The tither morn when I forlorn    Ae fond kiss, and then we sever    Lovely Davies    The weary Pond o' Tow    Naebody    An O for ane and twenty, Tam    O Kenmure's on and awa, Willie    The Collier Laddie    Nithsdale's Welcome Hame    As I was a-wand'ring ae Midsummer e'enin    Bessy and her Spinning-wheel    The Posie    The Country Lass    Turn again, thou fair Eliza    Ye Jacobites by name    Ye flowery banks o'bonnie Doon    Ye banks and braes o' bonnie Doon    Willie Wastle    O Lady Mary Ann    Such a parcel of rogues in a nation    The Carle of Kellyburn braes    Jockey's ta'en the parting kiss    Lady Onlie    The Chevalier's Lament    Song of Death    Flow gently, sweet Afton    Bonnie Bell    Hey ca' thro', ca' thro'    The Gallant weaver    The deuks dang o'er my Daddie    She's fair and fause    The Deil cam' fiddling thro' the town    The lovely Lass of Inverness    O my luve's like a red, red rose    Louis, what reck I by thee    Had I the wyte she bade me    Coming through the rye    Young Jamie, pride of a' the plain    Out over the Forth I look to the north    The Lass of Ecclefechan    The Cooper o' Cuddie    For the sake of somebody    I coft a stane o' haslock woo    The lass that made the bed for me    Sae far awa    I'll ay ca' in by yon town    O wat ye wha's in yon town    O May, thy morn    Lovely Polly Stewart    Bonnie laddie, Highland laddie    Anna, thy charms my bosom fire    Cassilis' Banks    To thee, lov'd Nith    Bannocks o' Barley    Hee Balou! my sweet wee Donald    Wae is my heart, and the tear's in my e'e    Here's his health in water    My Peggy's face, my Peggy's form    Gloomy December    My lady's gown, there's gairs upon 't    Amang the trees, where humming bees    The gowden locks of Anna    My ain kind dearie, O    Will ye go to the Indies, my Mary    She is a winsome wee thing    Bonny Leslie    Highland Mary    Auld Rob Morris    Duncan Gray    O poortith cauld, and restless love    Galla Water    Lord Gregory    Mary Morison    Wandering Willie.
