I suppose he sits indoors a good deal and mopes?\"    \"Exactly.\"    \"Then look here, my dear sir, give him a thorough change.  You are not  tied to your farming in any way?\"    \"Not in the least.\"    \"Then fit up a waggon, take your horses, and have a few months' campaign  in the wilds yonder.  You want a change as badly as the boy, and you  will both come back, I'll venture to say, doubled in strength.  Why, the  ivory and skins you'll collect will pay your expenses.  I wish I had the  chance to go.\"    It was settled then, and the waggon was being fitted up with ammunition  and stores; horses, guaranteed to be well-salted, had been purchased for  Mr Rogers and his boys.  The two young Zulus who had been hanging about  the place for months, making little trips with Dick and Jack, were to  go; and in addition a couple of trustworthy blacks, experienced as  waggon-driver and foreloper, had been engaged; so that in a very few  days they would say good-bye to civilisation for months, and go seek for  health in the far-off wilds.    The boys were delighted, for Mr Rogers proposed that they should aim  for the Zambesi River, and seek some of the seldom-traversed lands,  where game abounded, and where the wonders of nature would be opened to  them as from an unsealed book.    If Dick and Jack were delighted, the two Zulu boys were half mad with  joy.  As soon as they knew that they were to be of the party they seemed  to have become frantic, going through the actions of hunting and  spearing wild beasts--knocking down birds with their kiris, which they  threw with unerring aim--pantomimically fighting lions, one of them  roaring and imitating the fierce creature's \"oomph, oomph,\" in a way  that sounded terribly real, while the other threatened him with his  assegai.    Then they were always showing their cleverness as hunters by stalking  people--crawling up to them through the long grass, taking advantage of  every irregularity of the ground or shrub to get nearer, and grinning  with delight on seeing the surprise and fear of the person stalked.    For it was only during the past year that they had been so much amongst  the settlers in Natal.  Their early days had been spent with their tribe  in the north, their father being a redoubtable chief; but he had given  great offence to the king, and had been compelled to fly for his life,  finding refuge amongst the English, with his boys.    Mention has been made of well-salted horses, which to a sailor would  immediately suggest commissariat beef in pickle in good-sized tubs; but  pray don't imagine that the satisfactory condiment, salt, has anything  to do with a salted horse in South Africa.  A salted horse is one that  is seasoned to the climate by having passed through the deadly horse  sickness, a complaint so bad and peculiar to the land that very few of  the horses seized with it recover.  When one does recover he is called a  salted--that is, seasoned--horse, and his value is quadrupled.    Mr Rogers had spared no expense in getting together good cattle.  His  team of little Zulu oxen were the perfection of health and strength, and  far more docile than is generally the case with these animals; though  even these, in spite of their good behaviour, were exceedingly fond of  tickling each other's ribs with their long horns, and saving the driver  trouble, for the pair nearest the waggon would stir up the pair in front  of them, and as these could only retaliate on their aggressors with  their tails, they took their revenge on the pair in front; these again  punished the pair in front; and so on, and on, to the leading oxen, the  result of the many applications being a great increase of speed.    Then the horses were excellent.  Mr Rogers had three for his own  riding; a big bay, a dark grey, and a soft mouse-coloured chestnut, more  famous for speed than beauty, and with a nasty habit of turning round  and smiling, as if he meant to bite, when he was mounted.    Dick was clever at names, and he immediately suggested \"Smiler\" as an  appropriate name for the chestnut.  The dark grey he called \"Toothpick,\"  because of his habit of rubbing his teeth on the sharp points of the  fence; while he called the big bony bay the \"Nipper,\" from his being so  fond of grazing on, and taking nips from, the manes and tails of his  companions, when he could get a chance.    Mr Rogers provided three horses for his own riding, but it was with the  idea of giving either of his sons an extra mount when necessary, for it  was certain that there would be times when the arch-necked swift little  cobs purchased for his boys would want a rest.    It was a stroke of good fortune to get such a pair, and the boys were in  ecstasies when they were brought up from Maritzburg, for a handsomer  pair of little horses it would have been hard to find.  They were both  of that rich dark reddish roan, and wonderfully alike, the differences  being in their legs; one being nearly black in this important part of  its person, the other having what most purchasers would call the blemish  of four white legs--it being a canon amongst the wise in horseflesh that  a dark or black-legged horse has better sinews and lasting powers.  In  this case, however, the theory was wrong, for white legs was if anything  the stronger of the two.    The lads then were delighted, and this became increased when they found  the little nags quite ready to make friends, and willing to eat apples,  bread, or as much sugar out of their hands as they would give.    \"That's right, my boys,\" said Mr Rogers, who found his sons making  friends in this way with the new arrivals; \"always feed your horses  yourselves, and treat them well.  Pet them as much as you like, and win  their confidence by your kindness.  Never ill-use your horse; one act of  ill-treatment and you make him afraid of you, and then perhaps some day,  when in an emergency and you want to catch your horse, he may gallop  away.  Go on like that, and those cobs will follow you about like dogs.  But you must each keep to his own horse.  Which one would you like,  Jack?\"    \"Oh! the--\"    Jack stopped, and glanced at his brother, whose face was slightly  flushed.    Dick was weak and delicate, while Jack was the perfection of boyish  vigour; and feeling that his brother did not enjoy life as he did  himself, he stopped short just as he was going to say White Legs, for  there was something in the cob's face that he liked, and the little  horse had let him stroke its velvet nose.    \"Poor old Dick has taken a fancy to him,\" he said to himself; \"and the  other will do just as well for me.\"    \"Let Dick choose first,\" he said aloud.    \"Very well,\" said Mr Rogers.  \"Now then, Dick, which is it to be?  though you can't be wrong, my boy, for there is not a pin to choose  between them, and they are brothers.\"    \"Should you mind if I chose first, Jack?\" asked Dick.    \"Not a bit,\" said Jack, stoutly, though his feeling of disappointment  was keen, for he felt now that he would dearly love to have the  white-legged cob.    You may guess then his delight when Dick declared for the black-legged  one.    As soon as he heard the decision Jack had his arm over the white-legged  cob's neck and had given it a hug, the horse looking at him with its  great soft eyes, and uttering a low snort.    \"Up with you then, my boys, and have a canter.\"    \"Without a saddle, father?\" said Dick, nervously.    Jack was already up.    \"Have it saddled if you like, my boy,\" said Mr Rogers, kindly.    But Dick flushed, gave a spring from the ground, and was on the little  cob's back.    They were both skilled riders, but Dick's illness made him timorous at  times.  He, however, fought hard to master his weakness; and when Jack  cried, \"Come on, Dick; let's race to the big tree and back,\" he stuck  his knees into the cob's plump sides and away they went, with the wind  rushing by their ears, and the cobs keeping neck and neck, rounding the  big tree about a mile away on the plain, and then making the dusty earth  rise in clouds as they tore back, and were checked with a touch of the  bridle by the home field.    \"Why, Dick, my boy, I would not wish to see a better seat on a horse,\"  cried Mr Rogers, patting the cobs in turn.  \"Jack, you set up your back  like a jockey.  Sit more upright, my boy.\"    \"All right, father; I'll try,\" said Jack, throwing himself right forward  so as to hug his cob's neck.  \"But I say, father, isn't he lovely?  I  felt all the time as if I was a bit of him, or we were all one.\"    \"You looked like it, my boy,\" said Mr Rogers, smiling in his son's  animated face.  \"I wish Dick had your confidence, and you a little more  of his style.\"    \"All right, father, we'll try and exchange a bit a-piece,\" laughed Jack.  \"But I can't half believe it, father, that these are to be our own  horses.\"    \"You may believe it, then,\" said his father.  \"And now get them to the  stable.\"    \"Oh, I say, Dick, what beauties!\" cried Jack.  \"What shall you call  yours?\"    \"I don't know yet,\" replied his brother.  \"He's very fast.  `Swift'  wouldn't be a bad name; and we might call yours `Sure.'\"    \"Hum!  I don't think much of those names.  Hold up!\" he continued,  examining the hoofs of his brother's nag.  \"I say, Dick, what fine thick  shoes he has got.\"    \"That's a good suggestion,\" said Dick, laughing, and looking brighter  than he had seemed for weeks.  \"Let's call him `Shoes,' and his brother  with the white legs `Stockings.'\"    \"Shoes and Stockings!\" cried Jack;"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21381"],[0,"Stories Of Ohio (#3)"],[1,"English settlers, who would soon swarm into their country,  and drive them out.    The Indians did not believe Celoron, and yet he told them the truth. The  English traders were often men of low character, thoroughly dishonest in  their dealings, and the English settlers were only waiting for the end  of the struggle with the French to come and take the Indians' lands  from them. If the French soldiers and the French priests had won in  that struggle, Ohio and the whole West might now be something like the  Province of Quebec as it was then. The Indians would have been converted  to the Catholic faith, and they would still be found in almost as great  numbers as ever throughout the vast region where hardly one of their  blood remains.    But this was not to be. The French built their forts with a keen eye  for the strongest points in the wilderness, and the priests planted the  cross even beyond the forts. But all around and between the forts and  the missions, the traders from our colonies, which afterwards became our  states, stole into the country claimed for the king of France. At that  time, there was peace between the king of France and the king of England  in Europe, and they pretended that there was peace between their nations  in America. They were very civil to each other through their ministers  and ambassadors, over there, but their governors and captains here never  ceased to fight and trick for the ownership of the West. From their  forts, built to curb the English settlers, the French set the savages on  to harass the frontier of our colonies, which their war parties wasted  with theft and fire and murder. Our colonies made a poor defense,  because they were suspicious of one another. New England was suspicious  of New York, New York of Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania of Virginia, and  the mother country was suspicious of them all. She was willing that the  French should hold Canada, and keep the colonies from joining together  in a revolt against her, when she could easily have taken that province  and freed them from the inroads of the Canadian Indians. The colonies  would not unite against the common enemy, for fear one would have more  advantage than another from their union; but their traders went out  singly, through the West, and trading companies began to be formed in  Pennsylvania and Virginia. While Celoron was in Ohio claiming the whole  land for the king of France, the king of England was granting a great  part of the same to a company of Virginians, with the right to settle  it and fortify it The Virginia Company sent its agents to visit the  Miamis at Pickawillany a year later, and bound them to the English by  gifts of brandy, tobacco, beads, gay cloths, and powder.    The allied tribes, who had their capital at Pickawillany, numbered some  two thousand in all. The Miamis themselves are said to have been of the  same family as the great Iroquois nation of the East, who had beaten  their rivals of the Algonquin nation, and forced them to bear the name  of women. But many of the Ohio Indians were Delawares, who were of the  Algonquin family; they were by no means patient of the name of women,  and they and their friends now took the side of the French against the  English. When at last the West, together with the whole of Canada,  fell to the English and there presently began to be trouble between the  American colonists and the English king, all the Indians, both Iroquois  and Algonquins took part against the Americans. A little victory for  either side, however, with gifts of brandy and tobacco, would turn their  savage hearts toward the victors; and one must not be too confident in  saying that the Indians were always for the French against the English,  or always for the English against the Americans.    [Illustration: Pichawillany, Chief town of the Miamis 030]    In fact, one must speak mostly of the Indians in words that have a  double sense. The old explorers, missionaries, soldiers, and traders  all talk of nations, towns, villages, kings, half-kings, queens, and  princes, but these words present false images to our minds. Calling the  chief town of the Miamis at Pickawillany their capital gives the notion  of some such capital as Columbus or Washington; but if we imagine the  chief town of the Miamis as it really was, we see some hundreds of  wigwams in straggling clusters along the banks of the river, in the  shadow of the ancient woods, or in the sunshine of the beautiful  meadows, as the earliest white visitors to Ohio called the small  prairies which they came upon in the heart of the forests. We see a  large council house of bark, as nearly in the midst of the scattered  huts as may be, where the Miamis hold their solemn debates, receive  embassies from other tribes, welcome their warriors home from their  forays, and celebrate their feasts and dances. We see fields bordering  the village, where the squaws plant their corn and beans, and the maple  groves where they make their sugar. Among the men and boys we see the  busy idleness of children, all day long, except when the grown-up  children go out upon a hunt, or take the warpath. Sometimes we see an  English trader coming with his merchandise and presents, or a captive  brought in to be tortured and burnt, or adopted into the tribe.    The tribes in the Ohio country were far abler than those that the  English first met to the eastward, and they were fiercer than the  fiercest which the Americans have at last brought under control in the  plains of the Far West. Pitiless as Sioux and Apache and Comanche have  shown themselves in their encounters with the whites in our day, they  were surpassed in ferocity by the Shawnees, the Wyandots, and the Miamis  whom the backwoodsmen met in a thousand fights, a century or a century  and a half ago. The Ohio Indians were unspeakably vicious, treacherous,  and filthy, but they were as brave as they were vile, and they were  as sagacious as they were false. They produced men whom we must call  orators, statesmen, and generals, even when tested by the high standards  of civilization. They excelled us in the art of war as it was adapted  to the woods, and they despised the stupid and wasteful courage of the  disciplined English soldier. Till the white men studied war from them  they were always beaten in their fights with the red men, and it was  hardly the fault of the Indians if the pioneers learned from them to be  savages: to kill women and children as well as armed men, to tomahawk  and scalp the wounded, to butcher helpless prisoners. But this befell,  and it is this which makes many of the stories of Ohio so bloody. We  must know their hideous facts fully if we would know them truly, or if  we would realize the life that once passed in the shadows of our woods.    The region that we now call Ohio was wonderfully varied and pleasant.  The many rivers that watered it cleared their space to the sky where  they ran, and here and there the meadows or prairies smiled to the sun  in grass and flowers. But everywhere else there was the gloom of forests  unbroken since the Mound Builders left the land. The long levels that  bordered the great lake at the north, the noble hills that followed the  course of the Beautiful River, the gently varied surfaces of the center,  and the southwest, the swamps and morasses of the northwest, were nearly  everywhere densely wooded. Our land was a woodland, and its life, when  it first became known to the white man, was the stealthy and cruel life  of the forest. Where the busy Mound Builders once swarmed, scanty  tribes of savages lurked in the leafy twilight, hunting and fishing, and  warring upon one another. They came and went upon their errands of death  and rapine by trails unseen to other eyes, till the keen traders of  Pennsylvania and Virginia began to find their way over them to their  villages, and to traffic with the savages for the furs which formed  their sole wealth.    All is dim and vague in any picture of the time and place that we  can bring before us. There are the fathomless forests, broken by the  prairies and rivers; there are the Indian towns widely scattered along  the larger streams throughout the whole region; there are the French  posts on the northern border, with each a priest and a file of soldiers,  and a few Canadian farmers and traders. Under the cover of peace between  the French king and the English king, there is a constant grapple  between the French soldiers and the English settlers for the possession  of the wilds which shall one day be the most magnificent empire under  the sun; there are the war parties of Indians falling stealthily upon  the English borders to the eastward; there is the steady pressure of the  backwoodsman westward, in spite of every hardship and danger, in  spite of treaties, in spite of rights and promises. These are the main  features of the picture whose details the imagination strives to supply,  with a teasing sense of the obscurity resting upon the whole. It is all  much farther off than ancient Rome, much stranger than Greece; but it is  the beginning of a mighty history, which it rests with the children  of this day, and their children after them, to make the happiest and  noblest chapter in the history of the world. It is a part of that  greater history, and I should like my young readers to remember that  the Ohio stories which I hope to tell them are important chiefly because  they are human stories, and record incidents in the life of the whole  race. They cannot be taken from this without losing their finest  meanings.          III. OHIO BECOMES ENGLISH.    Neither the French nor the English had any right to the Ohio country  which they both claimed. If it belonged to any people of right, it  belonged to the savages, who held it in their way before the whites  came, and who now had to choose which nation should call itself their  master. They chose the French, and they chose"]]]
