I implore Thee by  Thy Name through which Thou hast subdued the whole creation, not to  withhold from me that which is with Thee, O Thou Who rulest over all men!  Thou seest, O my Lord, this stranger hastening to his most exalted home  beneath the canopy of Thy majesty and within the precincts of Thy mercy;  and this transgressor seeking the ocean of Thy forgiveness; and this lowly  one the court of Thy glory; and this poor creature the orient of Thy  wealth. Thine is the authority to command whatsoever Thou willest. I bear  witness that Thou art to be praised in Thy doings, and to be obeyed in Thy  behests, and to remain unconstrained in Thy bidding.    Let him then raise his hands, and repeat three times the Greatest Name.(1)  Let him then bend down with hands resting on the knees before God--blessed  and exalted be He--and say:    Thou seest, O my God, how my spirit hath been stirred up within my limbs  and members, in its longing to worship Thee, and in its yearning to  remember Thee and extol Thee; how it testifieth to that whereunto the  Tongue of Thy Commandment hath testified in the kingdom of Thine utterance  and the heaven of Thy knowledge. I love, in this state, O my Lord, to beg  of Thee all that is with Thee, that I may demonstrate my poverty, and  magnify Thy bounty and Thy riches, and may declare my powerlessness, and  manifest Thy power and Thy might.    Let him then stand and raise his hands twice in supplication, and say:    There is no God but Thee, the Almighty, the All-Bountiful. There is no God  but Thee, the Ordainer, both in the beginning and in the end. O God, my  God! Thy forgiveness hath emboldened me, and Thy mercy hath strengthened  me, and Thy call hath awakened me, and Thy grace hath raised me up and led  me unto Thee. Who, otherwise, am I that I should dare to stand at the gate  of the city of Thy nearness, or set my face toward the lights that are  shining from the heaven of Thy will? Thou seest, O my Lord, this wretched  creature knocking at the door of Thy grace, and this evanescent soul  seeking the river of everlasting life from the hands of Thy bounty. Thine  is the command at all times, O Thou Who art the Lord of all names; and  mine is resignation and willing submission to Thy will, O Creator of the  heavens!    Let him then raise his hands thrice, and say:    Greater is God than every great one!    Let him then kneel and, bowing his forehead to the ground, say:    Too high art Thou for the praise of those who are nigh unto Thee to ascend  unto the heaven of Thy nearness, or for the birds of the hearts of them  who are devoted to Thee to attain to the door of Thy gate. I testify that  Thou hast been sanctified above all attributes and holy above all names.  No God is there but Thee, the Most Exalted, the All-Glorious.    Let him then seat himself and say:    I testify unto that whereunto have testified all created things, and the  Concourse on high, and the inmates of the all-highest Paradise, and beyond  them the Tongue of Grandeur itself from the all-glorious Horizon, that  Thou art God, that there is no God but Thee, and that He Who hath been  manifested is the Hidden Mystery, the Treasured Symbol, through Whom the  letters B and E (Be) have been joined and knit together. I testify that it  is He Whose name hath been set down by the Pen of the Most High, and Who  hath been mentioned in the Books of God, the Lord of the Throne on high  and of earth below.    Let him then stand erect and say:    O Lord of all being and Possessor of all things visible and invisible!  Thou dost perceive my tears and the sighs I utter, and hearest my  groaning, and my wailing, and the lamentation of my heart. By Thy might!  My trespasses have kept me back from drawing nigh unto Thee; and my sins  have held me far from the court of Thy holiness. Thy love, O my Lord, hath  enriched me, and separation from Thee hath destroyed me, and remoteness  from Thee hath consumed me. I entreat Thee by Thy footsteps in this  wilderness, and by the words \"Here am I. Here am I\" which Thy chosen Ones  have uttered in this immensity, and by the breaths of Thy Revelation, and  the gentle winds of the Dawn of Thy Manifestation, to ordain that I may  gaze on Thy beauty and observe whatsoever is in Thy Book.    Let him then repeat the Greatest Name thrice, and bend down with hands  resting on the knees, and say:    Praise be to Thee, O my God, that Thou hast aided me to remember Thee and  to praise Thee, and hast made known unto me Him Who is the Dayspring of  Thy signs, and hast caused me to bow down before Thy Lordship, and humble  myself before Thy Godhead, and to acknowledge that which hath been uttered  by the Tongue of Thy grandeur.    Let him then rise and say:    O God, my God! My back is bowed by the burden of my sins, and my  heedlessness hath destroyed me. Whenever I ponder my evil doings and Thy  benevolence, my heart melteth within me, and my blood boileth in my veins.  By Thy Beauty, O Thou the Desire of the world! I blush to life up my face  to Thee, and my longing hands are ashamed to stretch forth toward the  heaven of Thy bounty. Thou seest, O my God, how my tears prevent me from  remembering Thee and from extolling Thy virtues, O Thou the Lord of the  Throne on high and of earth below! I implore Thee by the signs of Thy  Kingdom and the mysteries of Thy Dominion to do with Thy loved ones as  becometh Thy bounty, O Lord of all being, and is worthy of Thy grace, O  King of the seen and the unseen!    Let him then repeat the Greatest Name thrice, and kneel with his forehead  to the ground, and say:    Praise be unto Thee, O our God, that Thou hast sent down unto us that  which draweth us nigh unto Thee, and supplieth us with every good thing  sent down by Thee in Thy Books and Thy Scriptures. Protect us, we beseech  Thee, O my Lord, from the hosts of idle fancies and vain imaginations.  Thou, in truth, art the Mighty, the All-Knowing.    Let him then raise his head, and seat himself, and say:    I testify, O my God, to that whereunto Thy chosen Ones have testified, and  acknowledge that which the inmates of the all-highest Paradise and those  who have circled round Thy mighty Throne have acknowledged. The kingdoms  of earth and heaven are Thine, O Lord of the worlds!    --Baha'u'llah            GENERAL PRAYERS          AID AND ASSISTANCE        \"O Thou Whose face is the object of my adoration,...\"      O Thou Whose face is the object of my adoration, Whose beauty is my  sanctuary, Whose habitation is my goal, Whose praise is my hope, Whose  providence is my companion, Whose love is the cause of my being, Whose  mention is my solace, Whose nearness is my desire, Whose presence is my  dearest wish and highest aspiration, I entreat Thee not to withhold from  me the things Thou didst ordain for the chosen ones among Thy servants.  Supply me, then, with the good of this world and of the next.    Thou, truly, art the King of all men. There is no God but Thee, the  Ever-Forgiving, the Most Generous.    --Baha'u'llah        \"My God, my Adored One, my King, my Desire!...\"      My God, my Adored One, my King, my Desire! What tongue can voice my thanks  to Thee? I was heedless, Thou didst awaken me. I had turned back from  Thee, Thou didst graciously aid me to turn towards Thee. I was as one  dead, Thou didst quicken me with the water of life. I was withered, Thou  didst revive me with the heavenly stream of Thine utterance which hath  flowed forth from the Pen of the All-Merciful.    O Divine Providence! All existence is begotten by Thy bounty; deprive it  not of the waters of Thy generosity, neither do Thou withhold it from the  ocean of Thy mercy. I beseech Thee to aid and assist me at all times and  under all conditions, and seek from the heaven of Thy grace Thine ancient  favor. Thou art, in truth, the Lord of bounty, and the Sovereign of the  kingdom of eternity.    --Baha'u'llah        \"Lauded be Thy Name, O Lord our God! Thou...\"      Lauded be Thy Name, O Lord our God! Thou art in truth the Knower of things  unseen. Ordain for us such good as Thine all-embracing knowledge can  measure. Thou art the sovereign Lord, the Almighty, the Best-Beloved.    All praise be unto Thee, O Lord! We shall seek Thy grace on the appointed  Day and shall put our whole reliance in Thee, Who art our Lord. Glorified  art Thou, O God! Grant us that which is good and seemly that we may be  able to dispense with everything but Thee. Verily, Thou art the Lord of  all worlds.    O God! Recompense those who endure patiently in Thy days, and strengthen  their hearts to walk undeviatingly in the path of Truth. Grant then, O  Lord, such goodly gifts as would enable them to gain admittance into Thy  blissful Paradise. Exalted art Thou, O Lord God. Let Thy heavenly  blessings descend upon homes whose inmates have believed in Thee. Verily,  unsurpassed art Thou in sending down divine blessings. Send forth, O God,  such hosts as would render Thy faithful servants victorious. Thou dost  fashion the created things through the power of Thy decree as Thou  pleasest. Thou art in truth the Sovereign, the Creator, the All-Wise.    Say: God is indeed the Maker of all things. He giveth sustenance in plenty  to whomsoever He willeth. He is the Creator, the Source of all beings, the  Fashioner, the Almighty, the Maker, the All-Wise. He is the Bearer of the  most excellent titles throughout the heavens and the earth and whatever  lieth between them. All do His bidding, and all the dwellers of earth and  heaven celebrate His praise, and unto Him shall all return.    --The Bab        \"O my God, my Lord and my Master! I have...\"      O my God, my Lord and my Master! I have detached myself from my kindred  and have sought through Thee to become independent of all that dwell on  earth and ever ready to receive that which is praiseworthy in Thy sight.

What other community can lay claim to have  had a decisive share in the worldwide efforts that have been exerted for  the safeguarding and the extension of the immediate surroundings of its  holy shrines, as well as for the preliminary acquisition of the future  sites of its international institutions at its world center? What other  community can to its eternal credit claim to have been the first to frame  its national and local constitutions, thereby laying down the fundamental  lines of the twin charters designed to regulate the activities, define the  functions, and safeguard the rights, of its institutions? What other  community can boast of having simultaneously acquired and legally secured  the basis of its national endowments, thus paving the way for a similar  action on the part of its local communities? What other community has  achieved the supreme distinction of having obtained, long before any of  its sister communities had envisaged such a possibility, the necessary  documents assuring the recognition, by both the federal and state  authorities, of its Spiritual Assemblies and national endowments? And  finally what other community has had the privilege, and been granted the  means, to succor the needy, to plead the cause of the downtrodden, and to  intervene so energetically for the safeguarding of Baha'i edifices and  institutions in countries such as Persia, Egypt, 'Iraq, Russia, and  Germany, where, at various times, its fellow-believers have had to suffer  the rigors of both religious and racial persecution?    Such a matchless and brilliant record of service, extending over a period  of well-nigh twenty years, and so closely interwoven with the interest and  fortunes of such a large section of the worldwide Baha'i community,  deserves to rank as a memorable chapter in the history of the Formative  Period of the Faith of Baha'u'llah. Reinforced and enriched as it is by  the memory of the American believers' earlier achievements, such a record  is in itself convincing testimony to their ability to befittingly shoulder  the responsibilities which any task may impose upon them in the future. To  overrate the significance of these manifold services would be well-nigh  impossible. To appraise correctly their value, and dilate on their merits  and immediate consequences, is a task which only a future Baha'i historian  can properly discharge. I can only for the present place on record my  profound conviction that a community capable of showing forth such deeds,  of evincing such a spirit, of rising to such heights, cannot but be  already possessed of such potentialities as will enable it to vindicate,  in the fullness of time, its right to be acclaimed as the chief creator  and champion of the World Order of Baha'u'llah.    Magnificent as has been this record, reminiscent as it is, in some of its  aspects, of the exploits with which the dawn-breakers of an heroic Age  have proclaimed the birth of the Faith itself, the task associated with  the name of this privileged community is, far from approaching its climax,  only beginning to unfold. What the American believers have, within the  space of almost fifty years, achieved is infinitesimal when compared to  the magnitude of the tasks ahead of them. The rumblings of that  catastrophic upheaval, which is to proclaim, at one and the same time, the  death-pangs of the old order and the birth-pangs of the new, indicate both  the steady approach, as well as the awe-inspiring character, of those  tasks.    The virtual establishment of the Administrative Order of their Faith, the  erection of its framework, the fashioning of its instruments, and the  consolidation of its subsidiary institutions, was the first task committed  to their charge, as an organized community called into being by the Will,  and under the instructions, of 'Abdu'l-Baha. Of this initial task they  have acquitted themselves with marvelous promptitude, fidelity, and vigor.  No sooner had they created and correlated the various and necessary  agencies for the efficient conduct of any policy they might subsequently  wish to initiate, than they addressed themselves, with equal zest and  consecration, to the next more arduous task of erecting the superstructure  of an edifice the cornerstone of which 'Abdu'l-Baha Himself had laid. And  when that feat was achieved, this community, alive to the passionate  pleas, exhortations, and promises recorded in the Tablets of the Divine  Plan, resolved to undertake yet another task, which in its scope and  spiritual potentialities is sure to outshine any of the works they have  already accomplished. Launching with unquenchable enthusiasm and dauntless  courage the Seven Year Plan, as the first and practical step towards the  fulfillment of the mission prescribed in those epoch-making Tablets, they  entered, with a spirit of renewed consecration, upon their dual task, the  consummation of which, it is hoped, will synchronize with the celebration  of the centenary of the birth of the Faith of Baha'u'llah. Well aware that  every advance made in the external ornamentation of their majestic edifice  would directly react on the progress of the teaching campaign initiated by  them in both the northern and southern American continents, and realizing  that every victory gained in the teaching field would, in its turn,  facilitate the work, and hasten the completion, of their Temple, they are  now pressing on, with courage and faith, in their efforts to discharge, in  both of its phases, their obligations under the Plan they have dedicated  themselves to execute.    Let them not, however, imagine that the carrying out of the Seven Year  Plan, coinciding as it does with the termination of the first century of  the Baha'i era, signifies either the termination of, or even an  interruption in, the work which the unerring Hand of the Almighty is  directing them to perform. The opening of the second century of the Baha'i  era must needs disclose greater vistas, usher in further stages, and  witness the initiation of plans more far-reaching than any as yet  conceived. The Plan on which is now focused the attention, the  aspirations, and the resources of the entire community of the American  believers should be viewed as a mere beginning, as a trial of strength, a  stepping-stone to a crusade of still greater magnitude, if the duties and  responsibilities with which the Author of the Divine Plan has invested  them are to be honorably and entirely fulfilled.    For the consummation of the present Plan can result in no more than the  formation of at least one center in each of the Republics of the Western  Hemisphere, whereas the duties prescribed in those Tablets call for a  wider diffusion, and imply the scattering of a far greater and more  representative number of the members of the North American Baha'i  community over the entire surface of the New World. It is the undoubted  mission of the American believers, therefore, to carry forward into the  second century the glorious work initiated in the closing years of the  first. Not until they have played their part in guiding the activities of  these isolated and newly fledged centers, and in fostering their capacity  to initiate in their turn institutions, both local and national, modeled  on their own, can they be satisfied to have adequately discharged their  immediate obligations under 'Abdu'l-Baha's divinely revealed Plan.    Nor should it for a moment be supposed that the completion of a task which  aims at the multiplication of Baha'i centers and the provision of the  assistance and guidance necessary for the establishment of the  Administrative Order of the Baha'i Faith in the countries of Latin America  realizes in its entirety the scheme visualized for them by 'Abdu'l-Baha. A  perusal, however perfunctory, of those Tablets embodying His Plan will  instantly reveal a scope for their activities that stretches far beyond  the confines of the Western Hemisphere. With their inter-American tasks  and responsibilities virtually discharged, their intercontinental mission  enters upon its most glorious and decisive phase. \"The moment this Divine  Message,\" 'Abdu'l-Baha Himself has written, \"is carried forward by the  American believers from the shores of America and is propagated through  the continents of Europe, of Asia, of Africa, and of Australasia, and as  far as the islands of the Pacific, this community will find itself  securely established upon the throne of an everlasting dominion.\"    And who knows but that when this colossal task has been accomplished a  greater, a still more superb mission, incomparable in its splendor, and  foreordained for them by Baha'u'llah, may not be thrust upon them? The  glories of such a mission are of such dazzling splendor, the circumstances  attending it so remote, and the contemporary events with the culmination  of which it is so closely knit in such a state of flux, that it would be  premature to attempt, at the present time, any accurate delineation of its  features. Suffice it to say that out of the turmoil and tribulations of  these \"latter years\" opportunities undreamt of will be born, and  circumstances unpredictable created, that will enable, nay impel, the  victorious prosecutors of 'Abdu'l-Baha's Plan, to add, through the part  they will play in the unrolling of the New World Order, fresh laurels to  the crown of their servitude to the threshold of Baha'u'llah.    Nor should any of the manifold opportunities, of a totally different  order, be allowed to pass unnoticed which the evolution of the Faith  itself, whether at its world center, or in the North American continent,  or even in the most outlying regions of the earth, must create, calling  once again upon the American believers to play a part, no less conspicuous  than the share they have"]]]
