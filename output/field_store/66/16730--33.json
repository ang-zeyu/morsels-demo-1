The company under the little tent were not  exceptions to the rule. They were hungry, and ate heartily; and,  after the wine, they talked.    \"To a wayfarer in a strange land nothing is so sweet as to hear his  name on the tongue of a friend,\" said the Egyptian, who assumed to be  president of the repast. \"Before us lie many days of companionship.  It is time we knew each other. So, if it be agreeable, he who came  last shall be first to speak.\"    Then, slowly at first, like one watchful of himself, the Greek  began:    \"What I have to tell, my brethren, is so strange that I hardly  know where to begin or what I may with propriety speak. I do not  yet understand myself. The most I am sure of is that I am doing a  Master's will, and that the service is a constant ecstasy. When I  think of the purpose I am sent to fulfil, there is in me a joy so  inexpressible that I know the will is God's.\"    The good man paused, unable to proceed, while the others, in sympathy  with his feelings, dropped their gaze.    \"Far to the west of this,\" he began again, \"there is a land which  may never be forgotten; if only because the world is too much its  debtor, and because the indebtedness is for things that bring to men  their purest pleasures. I will say nothing of the arts, nothing of  philosophy, of eloquence, of poetry, of war: O my brethren, hers is  the glory which must shine forever in perfected letters, by which  He we go to find and proclaim will be made known to all the earth.  The land I speak of is Greece. I am Gaspar, son of Cleanthes the  Athenian.    \"My people,\" he continued, \"were given wholly to study, and from them  I derived the same passion. It happens that two of our philosophers,  the very greatest of the many, teach, one the doctrine of a Soul  in every man, and its Immortality; the other the doctrine of One  God, infinitely just. From the multitude of subjects about which  the schools were disputing, I separated them, as alone worth the  labor of solution; for I thought there was a relation between God  and the soul as yet unknown. On this theme the mind can reason to  a point, a dead, impassable wall; arrived there, all that remains  is to stand and cry aloud for help. So I did; but no voice came  to me over the wall. In despair, I tore myself from the cities  and the schools.\"    At these words a grave smile of approval lighted the gaunt face  of the Hindoo.    \"In the northern part of my country--in Thessaly,\" the Greek  proceeded to say, \"there is a mountain famous as the home of the  gods, where Theus, whom my countrymen believe supreme, has his  abode; Olympus is its name. Thither I betook myself. I found a  cave in a hill where the mountain, coming from the west, bends to  the southeast; there I dwelt, giving myself up to meditation--no,  I gave myself up to waiting for what every breath was a prayer--for  revelation. Believing in God, invisible yet supreme, I also believed  it possible so to yearn for him with all my soul that he would take  compassion and give me answer.\"    \"And he did--he did!\" exclaimed the Hindoo, lifting his hands from  the silken cloth upon his lap.    \"Hear me, brethren,\" said the Greek, calming himself with an effort.  \"The door of my hermitage looks over an arm of the sea, over the  Thermaic Gulf. One day I saw a man flung overboard from a ship  sailing by. He swam ashore. I received and took care of him.  He was a Jew, learned in the history and laws of his people;  and from him I came to know that the God of my prayers did  indeed exist; and had been for ages their lawmaker, ruler,  and king. What was that but the Revelation I dreamed of? My  faith had not been fruitless; God answered me!\"    \"As he does all who cry to him with such faith,\" said the Hindoo.    \"But, alas!\" the Egyptian added, \"how few are there wise enough  to know when he answers them!\"    \"That was not all,\" the Greek continued. \"The man so sent to me  told me more. He said the prophets who, in the ages which followed  the first revelation, walked and talked with God, declared he would  come again. He gave me the names of the prophets, and from the  sacred books quoted their very language. He told me, further,  that the second coming was at hand--was looked for momentarily  in Jerusalem.\"    The Greek paused, and the brightness of his countenance faded.    \"It is true,\" he said, after a little--\"it is true the man told  me that as God and the revelation of which he spoke had been for  the Jews alone, so it would be again. He that was to come should  be King of the Jews. 'Had he nothing for the rest of the world?'  I asked. 'No,' was the answer, given in a proud voice--'No, we are  his chosen people.' The answer did not crush my hope. Why should  such a God limit his love and benefaction to one land, and, as it  were, to one family? I set my heart upon knowing. At last I broke  through the man's pride, and found that his fathers had been  merely chosen servants to keep the Truth alive, that the world  might at last know it and be saved. When the Jew was gone, and I  was alone again, I chastened my soul with a new prayer--that I  might be permitted to see the King when he was come, and worship  him. One night I sat by the door of my cave trying to get nearer  the mysteries of my existence, knowing which is to know God;  suddenly, on the sea below me, or rather in the darkness that  covered its face, I saw a star begin to burn; slowly it arose and  drew nigh, and stood over the hill and above my door, so that its  light shone full upon me. I fell down, and slept, and in my dream  I heard a voice say:    \"'O Gaspar! Thy faith hath conquered! Blessed art thou! With two  others, come from the uttermost parts of the earth, thou shalt see  Him that is promised, and be a witness for him, and the occasion of  testimony in his behalf. In the morning arise, and go meet them,  and keep trust in the Spirit that shall guide thee.'    \"And in the morning I awoke with the Spirit as a light within me  surpassing that of the sun. I put off my hermit's garb, and dressed  myself as of old. From a hiding-place I took the treasure which I  had brought from the city. A ship went sailing past. I hailed it,  was taken aboard, and landed at Antioch. There I bought the camel  and his furniture. Through the gardens and orchards that enamel  the banks of the Orontes, I journeyed to Emesa, Damascus, Bostra,  and Philadelphia; thence hither. And so, O brethren, you have my  story. Let me now listen to you.\"          CHAPTER IV      The Egyptian and the Hindoo looked at each other; the former waved  his hand; the latter bowed, and began:    \"Our brother has spoken well. May my words be as wise.\"    He broke off, reflected a moment, then resumed:    \"You may know me, brethren, by the name of Melchior. I speak to  you in a language which, if not the oldest in the world, was at  least the soonest to be reduced to letters--I mean the Sanscrit  of India. I am a Hindoo by birth. My people were the first to  walk in the fields of knowledge, first to divide them, first to  make them beautiful. Whatever may hereafter befall, the four  Vedas must live, for they are the primal fountains of religion and  useful intelligence. From them were derived the Upa-Vedas, which,  delivered by Brahma, treat of medicine, archery, architecture,  music, and the four-and-sixty mechanical arts; the Ved-Angas,  revealed by inspired saints, and devoted to astronomy, grammar,  prosody, pronunciation, charms and incantations, religious rites  and ceremonies; the Up-Angas, written by the sage Vyasa, and given  to cosmogony, chronology, and geography; therein also are the  Ramayana and the Mahabharata, heroic poems, designed for the  perpetuation of our gods and demi-gods. Such, O brethren, are the  Great Shastras, or books of sacred ordinances. They are dead to me  now; yet through all time they will serve to illustrate the budding  genius of my race. They were promises of quick perfection. Ask you  why the promises failed? Alas! the books themselves closed all  the gates of progress. Under pretext of care for the creature,  their authors imposed the fatal principle that a man must not  address himself to discovery or invention, as Heaven had provided  him all things needful. When that condition became a sacred law,  the lamp of Hindoo genius was let down a well, where ever since  it has lighted narrow walls and bitter waters.    \"These allusions, brethren, are not from pride, as you will  understand when I tell you that the Shastras teach a Supreme  God called Brahm; also, that the Puranas, or sacred poems of  the Up-Angas, tell us of Virtue and Good Works, and of the Soul.  So, if my brother will permit the saying\"--the speaker bowed  deferentially to the Greek--\"ages before his people were known,  the two great ideas, God and the Soul, had absorbed all the forces  of the Hindoo mind. In further explanation let me say that Brahm  is taught, by the same sacred books, as a Triad--Brahma, Vishnu,  and Shiva. Of these, Brahma is said to have been the author of our  race; which, in course of creation, he divided into four castes.  First, he peopled the worlds below and the heavens above; next,  he made the earth ready for terrestrial spirits; then from his  mouth proceeded the Brahman caste, nearest in likeness to himself,  highest and noblest, sole teachers of the Vedas, which at the same time  flowed from his lips in finished state, perfect in all useful knowledge.  From his arms next issued the Kshatriya, or warriors; from his breast,  the seat of life, came the Vaisya, or producers--shepherds, farmers,  merchants; from his foot, in sign of degradation, sprang the Sudra,  or serviles, doomed to menial duties for the other classes--serfs,  domestics, laborers, artisans. Take notice, further, that the law,  so born with them, forbade a man of one caste becoming a"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/215"],[0,"The Call of the Wild (#3)"],[1,"left alone, and  further, that there would be trouble if he were not left alone. \"Dave\"  he was called, and he ate and slept, or yawned between times, and took  interest in nothing, not even when the Narwhal crossed Queen Charlotte  Sound and rolled and pitched and bucked like a thing possessed. When  Buck and Curly grew excited, half wild with fear, he raised his head as  though annoyed, favored them with an incurious glance, yawned, and went  to sleep again.    Day and night the ship throbbed to the tireless pulse of the propeller,  and though one day was very like another, it was apparent to Buck that  the weather was steadily growing colder. At last, one morning, the  propeller was quiet, and the Narwhal was pervaded with an atmosphere of  excitement. He felt it, as did the other dogs, and knew that a change  was at hand. Francois leashed them and brought them on deck. At the  first step upon the cold surface, Buck's feet sank into a white mushy  something very like mud. He sprang back with a snort. More of this white  stuff was falling through the air. He shook himself, but more of it fell  upon him. He sniffed it curiously, then licked some up on his tongue. It  bit like fire, and the next instant was gone. This puzzled him. He tried  it again, with the same result. The onlookers laughed uproariously, and  he felt ashamed, he knew not why, for it was his first snow.          Chapter II. The Law of Club and Fang      Buck's first day on the Dyea beach was like a nightmare. Every hour was  filled with shock and surprise. He had been suddenly jerked from the  heart of civilization and flung into the heart of things primordial.  No lazy, sun-kissed life was this, with nothing to do but loaf and be  bored. Here was neither peace, nor rest, nor a moment's safety. All  was confusion and action, and every moment life and limb were in peril.  There was imperative need to be constantly alert; for these dogs and men  were not town dogs and men. They were savages, all of them, who knew no  law but the law of club and fang.    He had never seen dogs fight as these wolfish creatures fought, and his  first experience taught him an unforgetable lesson. It is true, it was  a vicarious experience, else he would not have lived to profit by it.  Curly was the victim. They were camped near the log store, where she, in  her friendly way, made advances to a husky dog the size of a full-grown  wolf, though not half so large as she. There was no warning, only a leap  in like a flash, a metallic clip of teeth, a leap out equally swift, and  Curly's face was ripped open from eye to jaw.    It was the wolf manner of fighting, to strike and leap away; but there  was more to it than this. Thirty or forty huskies ran to the spot and  surrounded the combatants in an intent and silent circle. Buck did not  comprehend that silent intentness, nor the eager way with which they  were licking their chops. Curly rushed her antagonist, who struck again  and leaped aside. He met her next rush with his chest, in a peculiar  fashion that tumbled her off her feet. She never regained them, This  was what the onlooking huskies had waited for. They closed in upon her,  snarling and yelping, and she was buried, screaming with agony, beneath  the bristling mass of bodies.    So sudden was it, and so unexpected, that Buck was taken aback. He saw  Spitz run out his scarlet tongue in a way he had of laughing; and he saw  Francois, swinging an axe, spring into the mess of dogs. Three men  with clubs were helping him to scatter them. It did not take long. Two  minutes from the time Curly went down, the last of her assailants were  clubbed off. But she lay there limp and lifeless in the bloody, trampled  snow, almost literally torn to pieces, the swart half-breed standing  over her and cursing horribly. The scene often came back to Buck to  trouble him in his sleep. So that was the way. No fair play. Once down,  that was the end of you. Well, he would see to it that he never went  down. Spitz ran out his tongue and laughed again, and from that moment  Buck hated him with a bitter and deathless hatred.    Before he had recovered from the shock caused by the tragic passing  of Curly, he received another shock. Francois fastened upon him an  arrangement of straps and buckles. It was a harness, such as he had seen  the grooms put on the horses at home. And as he had seen horses work,  so he was set to work, hauling Francois on a sled to the forest that  fringed the valley, and returning with a load of firewood. Though his  dignity was sorely hurt by thus being made a draught animal, he was too  wise to rebel. He buckled down with a will and did his best, though  it was all new and strange. Francois was stern, demanding instant  obedience, and by virtue of his whip receiving instant obedience;  while Dave, who was an experienced wheeler, nipped Buck's hind quarters  whenever he was in error. Spitz was the leader, likewise experienced,  and while he could not always get at Buck, he growled sharp reproof now  and again, or cunningly threw his weight in the traces to jerk Buck  into the way he should go. Buck learned easily, and under the combined  tuition of his two mates and Francois made remarkable progress. Ere they  returned to camp he knew enough to stop at \"ho,\" to go ahead at \"mush,\"  to swing wide on the bends, and to keep clear of the wheeler when the  loaded sled shot downhill at their heels.    \"T'ree vair' good dogs,\" Francois told Perrault. \"Dat Buck, heem pool  lak hell. I tich heem queek as anyt'ing.\"    By afternoon, Perrault, who was in a hurry to be on the trail with his  despatches, returned with two more dogs. \"Billee\" and \"Joe\" he called  them, two brothers, and true huskies both. Sons of the one mother though  they were, they were as different as day and night. Billee's one fault  was his excessive good nature, while Joe was the very opposite, sour and  introspective, with a perpetual snarl and a malignant eye. Buck received  them in comradely fashion, Dave ignored them, while Spitz proceeded to  thrash first one and then the other. Billee wagged his tail appeasingly,  turned to run when he saw that appeasement was of no avail, and cried  (still appeasingly) when Spitz's sharp teeth scored his flank. But no  matter how Spitz circled, Joe whirled around on his heels to face  him, mane bristling, ears laid back, lips writhing and snarling, jaws  clipping together as fast as he could snap, and eyes diabolically  gleaming--the incarnation of belligerent fear. So terrible was his  appearance that Spitz was forced to forego disciplining him; but to  cover his own discomfiture he turned upon the inoffensive and wailing  Billee and drove him to the confines of the camp.    By evening Perrault secured another dog, an old husky, long and lean  and gaunt, with a battle-scarred face and a single eye which flashed a  warning of prowess that commanded respect. He was called Sol-leks, which  means the Angry One. Like Dave, he asked nothing, gave nothing, expected  nothing; and when he marched slowly and deliberately into their midst,  even Spitz left him alone. He had one peculiarity which Buck was unlucky  enough to discover. He did not like to be approached on his blind side.  Of this offence Buck was unwittingly guilty, and the first knowledge he  had of his indiscretion was when Sol-leks whirled upon him and slashed  his shoulder to the bone for three inches up and down. Forever after  Buck avoided his blind side, and to the last of their comradeship had  no more trouble. His only apparent ambition, like Dave's, was to be left  alone; though, as Buck was afterward to learn, each of them possessed  one other and even more vital ambition.    That night Buck faced the great problem of sleeping. The tent, illumined  by a candle, glowed warmly in the midst of the white plain; and when he,  as a matter of course, entered it, both Perrault and Francois bombarded  him with curses and cooking utensils, till he recovered from his  consternation and fled ignominiously into the outer cold. A chill wind  was blowing that nipped him sharply and bit with especial venom into his  wounded shoulder. He lay down on the snow and attempted to sleep,  but the frost soon drove him shivering to his feet. Miserable and  disconsolate, he wandered about among the many tents, only to find that  one place was as cold as another. Here and there savage dogs rushed  upon him, but he bristled his neck-hair and snarled (for he was learning  fast), and they let him go his way unmolested.    Finally an idea came to him. He would return and see how his own  team-mates were making out. To his astonishment, they had disappeared.  Again he wandered about through the great camp, looking for them, and  again he returned. Were they in the tent? No, that could not be, else he  would not have been driven out. Then where could they possibly be? With  drooping tail and shivering body, very forlorn indeed, he aimlessly  circled the tent. Suddenly the snow gave way beneath his fore legs  and he sank down. Something wriggled under his feet. He sprang back,  bristling and snarling, fearful of the unseen and unknown. But a  friendly little yelp reassured him, and he went back to investigate. A  whiff of warm air ascended to his nostrils, and there, curled up under  the snow in a snug ball, lay Billee. He whined placatingly, squirmed and  wriggled to show his good will and intentions, and even ventured, as a  bribe for peace, to lick Buck's face with his warm wet tongue.    Another lesson. So that was the way they did it, eh? Buck confidently  selected a spot, and with much fuss and waste effort proceeded to dig a  hole for himself. In a trice the heat from his body filled the confined  space and he was asleep. The day had been long and arduous, and he slept  soundly and comfortably, though he growled and barked and wrestled with  bad dreams.    Nor did he open his eyes till roused by the noises of"]]]
