Luckily for me, Birch was an old hand at running hare, and up to all  sorts of dodges, so that I knew all it was needful for me to do was to  husband my \"wind,\" and run evenly with him, leaving him to shape our  course and regulate our pace.    It was a lively scene at the Dean's Warren, when we reached it a few  minutes before the appointed time that afternoon.  The \"pack\"--that is,  the twenty or thirty fellows who were to run as \"hounds\"--were fast  assembling, and divesting themselves of everything but their light  flannels.  The whipper-in, conspicuous by the little bugle slung across  his shoulders, and the light flag in his hand, was there in all the  importance of his office; and, as usual, the doctor and a party of  visitors, ladies and gentlemen, had turned out to witness the start.    \"Five minutes, hares!\" shouts Forwood, as Birch and I came on the spot.    We use the interval in stripping off all unnecessary apparel, and  girding ourselves with our bags of \"scent,\" or scraps of torn-up paper,  which we are to drop as we run.  Then we sit and wait the moment for  starting.  The turf is crisp under our feet; the sun is just warm enough  to keep us from shivering as we sit, and the wind just strong enough to  be fresh.  Altogether it is to be doubted if a real meet of real hounds  to hunt real hares--a cruel and not very manly sport, after all--could  be much more exciting than this is.    \"Half a minute!\" sings out the whipper-in, as we spring to our feet.    In another thirty seconds we are swinging along at a good pace down the  slope of the warren, in the direction of Colven meadows, and the hunt  has begun.    As long as we were in sight of the pack we kept up a good hard pace, but  on reaching cover we settled down at once to a somewhat more sober jog-  trot, in anticipation of the long chase before us.    We made good use of our five minutes' start, for by the time a distant  bugle note announced that the hounds were let loose on our track we had  covered a good piece of ground, and put several wide fields and ditches  and ugly hedges between us and our pursuers.    Now it was that Birch's experiences served us in good stead.  I never  knew a fellow more thoroughly cunning; he might have been a fox instead  of a hare.  Sometimes he made me run behind him and drop my scent on the  top of his, and sometimes keep a good distance off, and let the wind  scatter it as much as it could.  When we came to a gap, instead of  starting straight across the next field he would turn suddenly at right  angles, and keep close up under the hedge half-way round before striking  off into the open.  Among trees and bushes he zigzagged and doubled to  an alarming extent, so that it seemed as if we were losing ground every  moment.  So we should have been if the chase had been by sight instead  of by _scent_; but that would have been against all rules.    If the hounds were to see the hares twenty yards in front of them, and  the scent lay half a mile round, they would be bound, according to our  rules, to go the half-mile, however tempting the short cut might seem.    It was after a very wide circuit, ending up on the top of a moderate  rise, that we first caught sight of our pursuers.  As they were a full  six minutes behind us, we agreed to sit down under cover for a minute  and watch them.    At that moment they had evidently lost the scent, and were ferreting  about among some low trees and bushes in search of it.  We saw the flag  of the whipper-in marking the spot where it was last visible, and round  this, on all sides, the hounds were exploring busily in search of the  \"new departure.\"  Then, presently, came a cry of \"Forward!\" and off they  all started in our direction; and as the scent after that seemed to lie  pretty clear we considered it high time for us to resume our flight.    So we made off again, and being refreshed by our brief halt, made over a  couple of ploughed fields, which Birch suggested \"would make a few of  the hounds look foolish\"; and so on till we reached the first water we  had encountered since the start.  This was a trout-stream, well known to  some of us who were fond of fishing--nowhere more than half a foot deep,  and in some places easily passable, dry shod, on stepping-stones.  Birch, however, avoided these, and boldly splashing into the stream over  his ankles, bade me follow.    \"We'll soon dry up,\" he said, \"and this will gain us a minute or two.\"    Instead of going straight across, the wily hare began to paddle up the  middle of the stream for twenty or thirty yards, and, of course, in so  doing our scent was soon drifted away down the current.  So we flattered  ourselves, when we at last did make the opposite bank, that our pursuers  would be puzzled for a minute or two to know what had become of us.    After a further quarter of a mile we thought we might venture to take  another brief halt on the strength of this last manoeuvre.  We were  unable to do so where we could command a view of the hounds, but as we  reckoned we had at least gained three minutes, we felt we could quite  afford to take it easy for that length of time.    Fancy, then, our horror when, after about a couple of minutes, we heard  a cry of \"Forward!\" close to us, and evidently on this side of the  stream.    Off we dashed like mad, in a regular panic, and never checked our pace  till we had put three ploughed fields and a couple of wide ditches to  our credit.  We did not discover till it was all over how it was our  cunning scheme to perplex the hounds had thus miscarried.  Then we were  told that some of the scent, instead of dropping into the water, as we  intended, had lodged on the top of some stones in mid-stream, and this  had at once betrayed our dodge to the practised eyes of the foremost  hounds.  It was a caution to be more careful another time.    We had to work hard to make up for the ground we had lost by this  mistake, but our next sight of the hounds showed that we were fairly  ahead again, and that the ploughed fields had (as Birch predicted) told  on a good portion of the pack, who now (at least, those of them who were  at all well up) scarcely numbered a dozen.    Half a mile farther brought us to Wincot village, down the main street  of which we sped, greatly to the admiration of the inhabitants, who  turned out in force to see the sport.    By this time we had fairly got our \"second winds,\" and began to realise  the benefit of the steady training of the past fortnight.  At an  ordinary pace, with the second wind well laid on, we felt we ought to be  able to hold out for the run home, unless some very unexpected accident  should intervene.    Past the village, we rattled on till we came to the railway embankment,  across which we trespassed, not without some difficulty, as it was steep  and railed off on either side by high palisades.  Once over this, we  turned at right angles, and ran for half a mile close alongside the  line, and past Wincot station.  Here it was necessary to recross the  line (down a cutting this time), and as we were doing so we caught  sight, on our left, of the leading hounds scrambling to the top of the  embankment, which we had passed only a minute or two before.    Clear of the railway, there remained a good steady piece of work cut out  for us to reach home, across an awful country, full of hedges and  ditches, and as hilly as a pie-crust.    But Birch and I were well in the humour of the thing by this time, and  determined it should not be our fault if the \"great hunt\" of this year  ended in a victory for the hounds.  So we spurted for nearly a mile,  jumping most of the narrow ditches and low hedges that crossed our path,  and making as straight a course as the hilly ground allowed of.  But,  despite all our efforts, the occasional glimpses which we caught of our  pursuers showed us that we were unable to shake off four or five of the  leading hounds, who, with Forwood at their head, were coming on at a  great pace, and, if not gaining on us, at least not losing ground.    This would never do.  It would be all up if things went on so, we could  see; so the cunning Birch had once again to resort to his dodges to gain  time.    Suddenly altering our track, and leaving the fields, he struck a dusty  lane, which wound in and out in the direction of Parkhurst.  Now, as  this was a very dusty and a very chalky lane, and as the wind was  blowing the dust about very freely, it was easy to see why the artful  Birch made use of it on the present occasion.  Our white scraps of  paper, falling on the white road, and being fallen on by the white dust,  had a good chance of escaping detection, unless looked after very  carefully; and to make matters more secure, we dodged off into the  fields, and back again into the lane, pretty often, leaving our pursuers  a ditch to jump each time.    This manoeuvre answered fairly well, for the next time we saw the hounds  they were searching about by the side of a ditch for our track, a good  way to the rear.    We had now to face the hardest bit of work of the afternoon.  The last  two miles home were over a perfectly flat bit of country--so flat that  the hounds would have us in view nearly all the way, and, consequently,  to dodge or double would be simply useless.  Our only course was a  straight hard run for it, trusting to our legs and our wind to pull us  through.  So we settled down to the task with a will.  Scarcely had we  emerged into the open ground for a couple of minutes, when we saw a  figure dash out of the lane in full cry after us.    It was Forwood, the whipper-in, a terrible \"scud\" across country, and he  was only fifty yards or so ahead of three others, also celebrated for  their pace.  So we hares had our work cut out for us, and no mistake!    For a mile we ran as hard as we well could, turning neither to right nor  left, and halting neither at ditch nor dyke.

And it is not a little discouraging for me, and may well make you  doubtful of my right judgment in this endeavor to lead you into closer  attention to the bird, with its wings and claws still in its own  possession;--it is discouraging, I say, to observe that the beginning  of such more faithful and accurate observation in former art, is  exactly coeval with the commencement of its decline. The feverish and  ungraceful natural history of Paul, called, \"of the birds,\" Paolo degli  Uccelli, produced, indeed, no harmful result on the minds of his  contemporaries, they watched in him, with only contemptuous admiration,  the fantasy of zoological instinct which filled his house with painted  dogs, cats, and birds, because he was too poor to fill it with real  ones. Their judgment of this morbidly naturalistic art was conclusively  expressed by the sentence of Donatello, when going one morning into the  Old Market, to buy fruit, and finding the animal painter uncovering a  picture, which had cost him months of care, (curiously symbolic in its  subject, the infidelity of St. Thomas, of the investigatory fingering  of the natural historian,) \"Paul, my friend,\" said Donatello, \"thou art  uncovering the picture just when thou shouldst be shutting it up.\"    13. No harm, therefore, I repeat, but, on the contrary, some wholesome  stimulus to the fancy of men like Luca and Donatello themselves, came  of the grotesque and impertinent zoology of Uccello.    But the fatalest institutor of proud modern anatomical and scientific  art, and of all that has polluted the dignity, and darkened the  charity, of the greater ages, was Antonio Pollajuolo of Florence.  Antonio (that is to say) the Poulterer--so named from the trade of his  grandfather, and with just so much of his grandfather's trade left in  his own disposition, that being set by Lorenzo Ghiberti to complete one  of the ornamental festoons of the gates of the Florentine Baptistery,  there, (says Vasari) \"Antonio produced a quail, which may still be  seen, and is so beautiful, nay, so perfect, that it wants nothing but  the power of flight.\"    14. Here, the morbid tendency was as attractive as it was subtle.  Ghiberti himself fell under the influence of it; allowed the borders of  his gates, with their fluttering birds and bossy fruits, to dispute the  spectators' favor with the religious subjects they inclosed; and, from  that day forward, minuteness and muscularity were, with curious harmony  of evil, delighted in together; and the lancet and the microscope, in  the hands of fools, were supposed to be complete substitutes for  imagination in the souls of wise men: so that even the best artists are  gradually compelled, or beguiled, into compliance with the curiosity of  their day; and Francia, in the city of Bologna, is held to be a \"kind  of god, more particularly\" (again I quote Vasari) \"after he had painted  a set of caparisons for the Duke of Urbino, on which he depicted a  great forest all on fire, and whence there rushes forth an immense  number of every kind of animal, with several human figures. This  terrific, yet truly beautiful representation, was all the more highly  esteemed for the time that had been expended on it in the plumage of  the birds, and other minutiae in the delineation of the different  animals, and in the diversity of the branches and leaves of the various  trees seen therein;\" and thenceforward the catastrophe is direct, to  the ornithological museums which Breughel painted for gardens of Eden,  and to the still life and dead game of Dutch celebrities.    15. And yet I am going to invite you to-day to examine, down to almost  microscopic detail, the aspect of a small bird, and to invite you to do  this, as a most expedient and sure step in your study of the greatest  art.    But the difference in our motive of examination will entirely alter the  result. To paint birds that we may show how minutely we can paint, is  among the most contemptible occupations of art. To paint them, that we  may show how beautiful they are, is not indeed one of its highest, but  quite one of its pleasantest and most useful; it is a skill within the  reach of every student of average capacity, and which, so far as  acquired, will assuredly both make their hearts kinder, and their lives  happier.    Without further preamble, I will ask you to look to-day, more carefully  than usual, at your well-known favorite, and to think about him with  some precision.    16. And first, Where does he come from? I stated that my lectures were  to be on English and Greek birds; but we are apt to fancy the robin all  our own. How exclusively, do you suppose, he really belongs to us? You  would think this was the first point to be settled in any book about  him. I have hunted all my books through, and can't tell you how much he  is our own, or how far he is a traveler.    And, indeed, are not all our ideas obscure about migration itself? You  are broadly told that a bird travels, and how wonderful it is that it  finds its way; but you are scarcely ever told, or led to think, what it  really travels for--whether for food, for warmth, or for seclusion--and  how the traveling is connected with its fixed home. Birds have not  their town and country houses,--their villas in Italy, and shooting  boxes in Scotland. The country in which they build their nests is their  proper home,--the country, that is to say, in which they pass the  spring and summer. Then they go south in the winter, for food and  warmth; but in what lines, and by what stages? The general definition  of a migrant in this hemisphere is a bird that goes north to build its  nest, and south for the winter; but, then, the one essential point to  know about it is the breadth and latitude of the zone it properly  inhabits,--that is to say, in which it builds its nest; next, its  habits of life, and extent and line of southing in the winter; and  finally, its manner of traveling.    17. Now, here is this entirely familiar bird, the robin. Quite the  first thing that strikes me about it, looking at it as a painter, is  the small effect it seems to have had on the minds of the southern  nations. I trace nothing of it definitely, either in the art or  literature of Greece or Italy. I find, even, no definite name for it;  you don't know if Lesbia's \"passer\" had a red breast, or a blue, or a  brown. And yet Mr. Gould says it is abundant in all parts of Europe, in  all the islands of the Mediterranean, and in Madeira and the Azores.  And then he says--(now notice the puzzle of this),--\"In many parts of  the Continent it is a migrant, and, contrary to what obtains with us,  is there treated as a vagrant, for there is scarcely a country across  the water in which it is not shot down and eaten.\"    \"In many parts of the Continent it is a migrant.\" In what parts--how  far--in what manner?    18. In none of the old natural history books can I find any account of  the robin as a traveler, but there is, for once, some sufficient reason  for their reticence. He has a curious fancy in his manner of traveling.  Of all birds, you would think he was likely to do it in the cheerfulest  way, and he does it in the saddest. Do you chance to have read, in the  Life of Charles Dickens, how fond he was of taking long walks in the  night and alone? The robin, en voyage, is the Charles Dickens of birds.  He always travels in the night, and alone; rests, in the day, wherever  day chances to find him; sings a little, and pretends he hasn't been  anywhere. He goes as far, in the winter, as the north-west of Africa;  and in Lombardy, arrives from the south early in March; but does not  stay long, going on into the Alps, where he prefers wooded and wild  districts. So, at least, says my Lombard informant.    I do not find him named in the list of Cretan birds; but even if often  seen, his dim red breast was little likely to make much impression on  the Greeks, who knew the flamingo, and had made it, under the name of  Phoenix or Phoenicopterus, the center of their myths of scarlet birds.  They broadly embraced the general aspect of the smaller and more  obscure species, under the term [Greek: xonthos], which, as I  understand their use of it, exactly implies the indescribable silky  brown, the groundwork of all other color in so many small birds, which  is indistinct among green leaves, and absolutely identifies itself with  dead ones, or with mossy stems.    19. I think I show it you more accurately in the robin's back than I  could in any other bird; its mode of transition into more brilliant  color is, in him, elementarily simple; and although there is nothing,  or rather because there is nothing, in his plumage, of interest like  that of tropical birds, or even of our own game-birds, I think it will  be desirable for you to learn first from the breast of the robin what a  feather is. Once knowing that, thoroughly, we can further learn from  the swallow what a wing is; from the chough what a beak is; and from  the falcon what a claw is.    I must take care, however, in neither of these last two particulars, to  do injustice to our little English friend here; and before we come to  his feathers, must ask you to look at his bill and his feet.    20. I do not think it is distinctly enough felt by us that the beak of  a bird is not only its mouth, but its hand, or rather its two hands.  For, as its arms and hands are turned into wings, all it has to depend  upon, in economical and practical life, is its beak. The beak,  therefore, is at once its sword, its carpenter's tool-box, and its  dressing-case; partly also its musical instrument; all this besides its  function of seizing and preparing the food, in which functions alone it  has to be a trap, carving-knife, and teeth, all in one.    21. It is this need of the beak's being a mechanical tool which chiefly  regulates the form of a bird's face, as opposed to a four-footed  animal's. If the question "]]]
