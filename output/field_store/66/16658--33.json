I.    The name \"music\" contains two ideas, both of them important in our  modern use of the term: The general meaning is that of \"a pleasing  modulation of sounds.\" In this sense the term is used constantly by  poets, novelists and even in conversation--as when we speak of the  \"music of the forest,\" the \"music of the brook\" or the \"music of  nature.\" There is also a reminiscence of the etymological derivation  of the term, as something derived from the \"Muses,\" the fabled retinue  of the Greek god Apollo, who presided over all the higher operations  of the mind and imagination. Thus the name \"music,\" when applied to an  art, contains a suggestion of an inspiration, a something derived from  a special inner light, or from a higher source outside the composer,  as all true imagination seems to be to those who exercise it.    2. Music has to do with tones, sounds selected on account of their  musical quality and relations. These tones, again, before becoming  music in the artistic sense, must be so joined together, set in order,  controlled by the human imagination, that they express sentiment.  Every manifestation of musical art has in it these two elements: _The  fit selection_ of tones; and, second, the _use of them for expressing  sentiment and feeling_. Hence the practical art of music, like every  other fine art, has in it two elements, an _outer_, or technical,  where trained intelligence rules, and teaching and study are the  principal means of progress; and an _inner_, the imagination and  musical feeling, which can indeed be strengthened by judicious  experience in hearing, but which when wanting cannot be supplied by  the teacher, or the laws of their action reduced to satisfactory  statement.    3. There is no fine art which reflects the activity of spirit more  perfectly than that of music. There is something in the nature of this  form of art which renders it particularly acceptable to quick and  sensitive minds. If evidence of this statement were needed beyond the  intuitive assent which every musical reader will immediately give, it  could easily be furnished in the correspondence between the activity  of mind in general and in the art of music in particular, every great  period of mental strength having been accompanied by a corresponding  term of activity in music. Furthermore, the development of the art of  music has kept pace with the deepening of mental activity in general,  so that in these later times when the general movement of mind is so  much greater than in ancient times, and the operations of intellect so  much more diffused throughout all classes, the art of music has come  to a period of unprecedented richness and strength.      II.    4. The earlier forms of music were very simple; the range of tones  employed was narrow, and the habits of mind in the people employing  them apparently calm and almost inactive. As time passed on more and  more tones were added to the musical scales, and more and more  complicated relations recognized between them, and the music thereby  became more diversified in its tonal effects, and therein better  adapted for the expression of a more energetic or more sensitive  action of mind and feeling. This has been the general course of the  progress, from the earliest times in which there was an art of music  until now.    The two-fold progress of an education in tone perception, and an  increasing ability to employ elaborate combinations for the expression  of feelings too high-strung for the older forms of expression, is  observable in almost all stages of musical history, and in our own  days has received a striking illustration in the progress made in  appreciating the works of the latest of the great musical geniuses,  Richard Wagner, whose music twenty-five years ago was regarded by the  public generally as unmusical and atrocious; whereas now it is heard  with pleasure, and takes hold of the more advanced musical minds with  a firmness beyond that of any other musical production. The  explanation is to be found in the development of finer tone  perceptions--the ability to co-ordinate tonal combinations so  distantly related that to the musical ears of a generation ago their  relation was not recognized, therefore to those ears"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2030"],[0,"Legends of Babylon and Egypt in Relation to Hebrew Tradition (#3)"],[1," that the type  of population is ultimately determined by the blood of the peasantry.(1)  Hence after the Arab conquest the Greek elements in Syria and Palestine  tended rapidly to disappear. The Moslem invasion was only the last of a  series of similar great inroads, which have followed one another since  the dawn of history, and during all that time absorption was continually  taking place from desert tribes that ranged the Syrian border. As we  have seen, the country of his adoption was such as to encourage  the Semitic nomad's particularism, which was inherent in his tribal  organization. Thus the predominance of a single racial element in the  population of Palestine and Syria did little to break down or overstep  the natural barriers and lines of cleavage.         (1) See Robertson Smith, _Religion of the Semites_, p. 12       f.; and cf. Smith, _Hist. Geogr._, p. 10 f.    These facts suffice to show why the influence of both Egypt and Babylon  upon the various peoples and kingdoms of Palestine was only intensified  at certain periods, when ambition for extended empire dictated the  reduction of her provinces in detail. But in the long intervals,  during which there was no attempt to enforce political control, regular  relations were maintained along the lines of trade and barter. And in  any estimate of the possible effect of foreign influence upon Hebrew  thought, it is important to realize that some of the channels through  which in later periods it may have acted had been flowing since the dawn  of history, and even perhaps in prehistoric times. It is probable that  Syria formed one of the links by which we may explain the Babylonian  elements that are attested in prehistoric Egyptian culture.(1) But  another possible line of advance may have been by way of Arabia and  across the Red Sea into Upper Egypt.         (1) Cf. _Sumer and Akkad_, pp. 322 ff.; and for a full       discussion of the points of resemblance between the early       Babylonian and Egyptian civilizations, see Sayce, _The       Archaeology of the Cuneiform Inscriptions_, chap. iv, pp.       101 ff.    The latter line of contact is suggested by an interesting piece of  evidence that has recently been obtained. A prehistoric flint knife,  with a handle carved from the tooth of a hippopotamus, has been  purchased lately by the Louvre,(1) and is said to have been found at  Gebel el-'Arak near Naga' Hamadi, which lies on the Nile not far below  Koptos, where an ancient caravan-track leads by Wadi Hammamat to the  Red Sea. On one side of the handle is a battle-scene including some  remarkable representations of ancient boats. All the warriors are nude  with the exception of a loin girdle, but, while one set of combatants  have shaven heads or short hair, the others have abundant locks falling  in a thick mass upon the shoulder. On the other face of the handle is  carved a hunting scene, two hunters with dogs and desert animals  being arranged around a central boss. But in the upper field is a very  remarkable group, consisting of a personage struggling with two lions  arranged symmetrically. The rest of the composition is not very unlike  other examples of prehistoric Egyptian carving in low relief, but here  attitude, figure, and clothing are quite un-Egyptian. The hero wears  a sort of turban on his abundant hair, and a full and rounded beard  descends upon his breast. A long garment clothes him from the waist and  falls below the knees, his muscular calves ending in the claws of a bird  of prey. There is nothing like this in prehistoric Egyptian art.         (1) See Benedite, \"Le couteau de Gebel al-'Arak\", in       _Foundation Eugene Piot, Mon. et. Mem._, XXII. i. (1916).    Perhaps Monsieur Benedite is pressing his theme too far when he compares  the close-cropped warriors on the handle with the shaven Sumerians and  Elamites upon steles from Telloh and Susa, for their loin-girdles are  African and quite foreign to the Euphrates Valley. And his suggestion  that two of the boats, flat-bottomed and with high curved ends, seem  only to have navigated the Tigris and Euphrates,(1) will hardly command  acceptance. But there is no doubt that the heroic personage upon the  other face is represented in the familiar attitude of the Babylonian  hero Gilgamesh struggling with lions, which formed so favourite a  subject upon early Sumerian and Babylonian seals. His garment is  Sumerian or Semitic rather than Egyptian, and the mixture of human and  bird elements in the figure, though not precisely paralleled at  this early period, is not out of harmony with Mesopotamian or Susan  tradition. His beard, too, is quite different from that of the Libyan  desert tribes which the early Egyptian kings adopted. Though the  treatment of the lions is suggestive of proto-Elamite rather than  of early Babylonian models, the design itself is unmistakably of  Mesopotamian origin. This discovery intensifies the significance of  other early parallels that have been noted between the civilizations of  the Euphrates and the Nile, but its evidence, so far as it goes, does  not point to Syria as the medium of prehistoric intercourse. Yet then,  as later, there can have been no physical barrier to the use of the  river-route from Mesopotamia into Syria and of the tracks thence  southward along the land-bridge to the Nile's delta.         (1) Op. cit., p. 32.    In the early historic periods we have definite evidence that the eastern  coast of the Levant exercised a strong fascination upon the rulers of  both Egypt and Babylonia. It may be admitted that Syria had little to  give in comparison to what she could borrow, but her local trade in wine  and oil must have benefited by an increase in the through traffic which  followed the working of copper in Cyprus and Sinai and of silver in  the Taurus. Moreover, in the cedar forests of Lebanon and the north  she possessed a product which was highly valued both in Egypt and  the treeless plains of Babylonia. The cedars procured by Sneferu from  Lebanon at the close of the IIIrd Dynasty were doubtless floated as  rafts down the coast, and we may see in them evidence of a regular  traffic in timber. It has long been known that the early Babylonian  king Sharru-kin, or Sargon of Akkad, had pressed up the Euphrates to the  Mediterranean, and we now have information that he too was fired by a  desire for precious wood and metal. One of the recently published Nippur  inscriptions contains copies of a number of his texts, collected by  an ancient scribe from his statues at Nippur, and from these we gather  additional details of his campaigns. We learn that after his complete  subjugation of Southern Babylonia he turned his attention to the west,  and that Enlil gave him the lands \"from the Upper Sea to the Lower Sea\",  i.e. from the Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf. Fortunately this rather  vague phrase, which survived in later tradition, is restated in greater  detail in one of the contemporary versions, which records that Enlil  \"gave him the upper land, Mari, Iarmuti, and Ibla, as far as the Cedar  Forest and the Silver Mountains\".(1)         (1) See Poebel, _Historical Texts_ (Univ. of Penns. Mus.       Publ., Bab. Sect., Vol. IV, No. 1, 1914), pp. 177 f., 222       ff.    Mari was a city on the middle Euphrates, but the name may here signify  the district of Mari which lay in the upper course of Sargon's march.  Now we know that the later Sumerian monarch Gudea obtained his cedar  beams from the Amanus range, which he names _Amanum_ and describes as  the \"cedar mountains\".(1) Doubtless he felled his trees on the eastern  slopes of the mountain. But we may infer from his texts that Sargon  actually reached the coast, and his \"Cedar Forest\" may have lain  farther to the south, perhaps as far south as the Lebanon. The \"Silver  Mountains\" can only be identified with the Taurus, where silver mines  were worked in antiquity. The reference to Iarmuti is interesting, for  it is clearly the same place as Iarimuta or Iarimmuta, of which we  find mention in the Tell el-Amarna letters. From the references to this  district in the letters of Rib-Adda, governor of Byblos, we may infer  that it was a level district on the coast, capable of producing a  considerable quantity of grain for export, and that it was under  Egyptian control at the time of Amenophis IV. Hitherto its position has  been conjecturally placed in the Nile Delta, but from Sargon's reference  we must probably seek it on the North Syrian or possibly the Cilician  coast. Perhaps, as Dr. Poebel suggests, it was the plain of Antioch,  along the lower course and at the mouth of the Orontes. But his further  suggestion that the term is used by Sargon for the whole stretch of  country between the sea and the Euphrates is hardly probable. For  the geographical references need not be treated as exhaustive, but as  confined to the more important districts through which the expedition  passed. The district of Ibla which is also mentioned by Naram-Sin and  Gudea, lay probably to the north of Iarmuti, perhaps on the southern  slopes of Taurus. It, too, we may regard as a district of restricted  extent rather than as a general geographical term for the extreme north  of Syria.         (1) Thureau-Dangin, _Les inscriptions de Sumer de d'Akkad_,       p. 108 f., Statue B, col. v. 1. 28; Germ. ed., p. 68 f.    It is significant that Sargon does not allude to any battle when  describing this expedition, nor does he claim to have devastated the  western countries.(1) Indeed, most of these early expeditions to the  west appear to have been inspired by motives of commercial enterprise  rather than of conquest. But increase of wealth was naturally followed  by political expansion, and Egypt's dream of an Asiatic empire was  realized by Pharaohs of the XVIIIth Dynasty. The fact that Babylonian  should then have been adopted as the medium of official intercourse in  Syria points to the"]]]
