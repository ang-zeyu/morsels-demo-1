The women took the wheat and pounded it with a wooden mallet or a  stone in a hollow in some larger stone. The coarse meal which they  made in this way they mixed with salt and water and baked on hot  stones before the campfire. Once in a great while it was possible, in  this shepherd life, to have a feast with mutton or kid or lamb. But  milk and wool were so valuable that the shepherds were very  cautious about killing their flocks. It was, you see, a very simple  and healthful diet on which these tent-people lived. But one meal was  pretty much like another. Dinner was like breakfast, and tomorrow's  meals would be just like to-day's. It is not strange that they often  longed for a change, and looked with envy at the crops of the farmers  in the settled lands beyond the desert.     +-------------------------------------------------------------------+   | [Illustration: BRONZE NEEDLES AND PINS FROM RUINS OF ANCIENT      |   | CANAANITE CITY]                                                   |   |                                                                   |   | [Illustration: CANAANITE NURSERY BOTTLES (CLAY)]                  |   |                                                                   |   | [Illustration: CANAANITE SILVER LADLE]                            |   |                                                                   |   | [Illustration: CANAANITE FORKS]                                   |   |                                                                   |   | Cuts on this page used by permission of the Palestine Exploration |   | Fund.                                                             |   +-------------------------------------------------------------------+      CLOTHING    Another occupation at which the women worked all day long was the  making of clothing for their families. Most of their garments were  made of the wool from their own flocks. First the wool had to be spun  into yarn. They did not even have spinning wheels in those days, so a  spinner took a handful of wool on the end of a stick called a distaff,  which she held in her left hand. With her right hand she hooked into  the wool a spindle. This was a round, pointed piece of wood about ten  inches long with a hook at the pointed end, and with a small piece of  stone fastened to the other to give momentum in the spinning. With  deft fingers the spinner kept this spindle whirling and at the same  time kept working the wool down into the thread of yarn which she was  making. As the thread lengthened she wound it around the spindle,  until the wool on the distaff was all gone and she had a great ball of  yarn.    =Weaving=.--The ancient Egyptians and Babylonians were experts in the  art of weaving. They had large looms similar to ours, and wove on them  beautiful fabrics of linen and wool. The shepherds on the plains no  doubt bought these fabrics when they could afford them. But they could  not carry these heavy looms around with them from one camp to another,  and much of the time their own women had to weave whatever cloth they  had. The primitive loom they used was made by driving two sticks into  the ground, and stretching a row of threads between them, and then  tediously weaving the cross threads in and out, a thread at a time,  until a yard or so of cloth was finished. Slow work this was, and many  a long day passed before enough cloth could be woven to make a coat  for a man or even a boy.    They managed, however, to get along without nearly so much clothing as  we think necessary. The little children, through warm days of summer,  played around the tents almost naked. And the grown people dressed  very simply. There were only two garments for either men or women.  They wore a long shirt reaching to the knees. This was made by  doubling over a strip of cloth, sewing the sides, and cutting out  holes for arms and neck. The outer garment was a sort of coat, open in  front, and gathered about the waist with leather belt. This outer  garment was often thrown aside when the wearer was working. It was  worn in cold weather, however, and was often the poor man's only  blanket at night. Women's garments were probably a little longer than  those of men, but in other respects the same. As for the feet, they  mostly went barefoot. But on long journeys over rough ground they wore  sandals of wood or roughly shaped shoes of sheepskin. On the head for  a protection against sun and wind they, like the modern Arab, probably  wore a sort of large scarf gathered around the neck.    =Making the garments.=--All these garments were cut and sewed by the  women. They had no sewing machines to work with, not even fine steel  needles like ours. They used large, coarse needles made of bronze or,  very often, of splinters of bone sharpened at one end, with a hole  drilled through the other. With such rough tools, and all this work to  be done, we can be sure that the wives and daughters of Hebrew  shepherds did not lack for something to do.      FAMILY LIFE    Among ancient Hebrews family life, from the very beginning, was often  sweet, kindly, and beautiful. This is shown by the many stories in the  early books of the Old Testament which reflect disapproval of  unbrotherly conduct, or, which hold up kindness and loyalty in family  life as a beautiful and praiseworthy thing. Take the story of Joseph.  It begins indeed with an unpleasant picture of an unhappy and unloving  family of shepherd brothers. We read of a father's partiality toward  the petted favorite, of a spoiled and conceited boy, of the bitter  jealousy of the other brothers, and finally of a crime in which they  showed no mercy when they sold their hated rival to a caravan of  traders to be taken away, it might be, forever. But the story goes on  to tell how that same lad, years later, grown to manhood and risen to  a position of extraordinary power and influence in the great kingdom  of Egypt, not only saved from death by starvation his family,  including those same brothers who had wronged him, but even effected a  complete reconciliation with them and nobly forgave them.    Now, the most notable facts in connection with this story are those  \"between the lines.\" It is not merely that such and such events are  said to have happened, but that for generations, perhaps centuries,  Hebrew fathers and mothers kept the story of these events alive,  telling it over and over again to their children. On numberless days,  no doubt, in this shepherd life there were bickering and angry words  among the children by the spring or at meal time, or in their games.  The older brothers were tyrannical toward the younger, or one or  another cherished black and unforgiving looks toward a brother or  sister who he thought had done him a wrong. And many a time after such  a day the old father would gather all the family together in the  evening around the camp fire in front of the tent and would begin to  tell the story of Joseph. And as the tale went on, with its thrilling  episodes, and its touches of pathos leading up at last to the  whole-souled generosity and the sweet human tenderness of Joseph, many  a little heart softened, and in the darkness many a little brown hand  sought a brother's hand in loving reconciliation.    =The tribe as a larger family.=--To some extent the desert shepherds  of all ages have carried this family spirit into the relations between  members of the tribe as a whole. Since they had to stand together for  protection, quarrels between tribesmen were discouraged. Moreover,  they were not separated into classes by difference of wealth. There  were some who had larger flocks than others, but for the most part all  members of the tribe were equal. Even from among the slaves who were  captured now and then in war there were some who rose to positions of  honor. There were no kings nor princes; the chief of the tribe held  his position by virtue of his long experience and practical wisdom.  The distinction between close blood relationship and the brotherhood  of membership in the same tribe was not sharply drawn; all were  brothers. This is true to-day of all these desert tribes.    Only a tribe, however, with an unusual capacity for brotherly  affection and for making social life sweet and harmonious could have  produced a Joseph or the story of Joseph, or would have preserved that  story in oral form through the centuries until it could be written  down. It is worth while looking into the later history of such a  tribe, and seeing what happened to them and how they thought and  acted, and what they contributed to the life of the world.      STUDY TOPICS    1. Get some cotton at a drug store, and see if you can spin some  cotton thread, with a homemade spindle, such as is described in this  chapter.    2. Who had the harder work among the Hebrew shepherds, the women or  the men?    3. Find other stories in Genesis besides the story of Joseph which  show how the Hebrews felt in regard to the relations between brothers.    4. Compare the home life in America with the home life of the Hebrews.  Are American brothers and sisters growing more quarrelsome or more  kindly and loving toward one another?    5. In what way do the oral traditions of a people throw light on the  ideals and relationships they most valued?    6. Compare the dietary available to Americans with that of the ancient  Hebrews.          CHAPTER III    DESERT PILGRIMS      According to one of the Hebrew traditions recorded in the book of  Genesis, the earliest home of their ancestors was Ur of the Chaldees.  This was one of the leading cities of ancient Babylonia. It was  situated southwest of the Euphrates River, near the plains which were  the nation's chief grazing grounds. And it is possible that of the  shepherds who brought their sheep to market in Ur some were, indeed,  among the ancestors of"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18193"],[0,"Ways of Wood Folk (#3)"],[1,"well, first told me how a fox manages to carry a  number of chicks at once. He heard a clamor from a hen-turkey and her  brood one day, and ran to a wood path in time to see a vixen make off  with a turkey chick scarcely larger than a robin. Several were  missing from the brood. He hunted about, and presently found five more  just killed. They were beautifully laid out, the bodies at a broad  angle, the necks crossing each other, like the corner of a corn-cob  house, in such a way that, by gripping the necks at the angle, all the  chicks could be carried at once, half hanging at either side of the  fox's mouth. Since then I have seen an old fox with what looked like a  dozen or more field-mice carried in this way; only, of course, the  tails were crossed corn-cob fashion instead of the necks.    The stealthiness with which a fox stalks his game is one of the most  remarkable things about him. Stupid chickens are not the only birds  captured. Once I read in the snow the story of his hunt after a  crow--wary game to be caught napping! The tracks showed that quite a  flock of crows had been walking about an old field, bordered by pine  and birch thickets. From the rock where he was sleeping away the  afternoon the fox saw or heard them, and crept down. How cautious he  was about it! Following the tracks, one could almost see him stealing  along from stone to bush, from bush to grass clump, so low that his  body pushed a deep trail in the snow, till he reached the cover of a  low pine on the very edge of the field. There he crouched with all  four feet close together under him. Then a crow came by within ten  feet of the ambush. The tracks showed that the bird was a bit  suspicious; he stopped often to look and listen. When his head was  turned aside for an instant the fox launched himself; just two jumps,  and he had him. Quick as he was, the wing marks showed that the crow  had started, and was pulled down out of the air. Reynard carried him  into the densest thicket of scrub pines he could find, and ate him  there, doubtless to avoid the attacks of the rest of the flock, which  followed him screaming vengeance.    A strong enmity exists between crows and foxes. Wherever a crow finds  a fox, he sets up a clatter that draws a flock about him in no time,  in great excitement. They chase the fox as long as he is in sight,  cawing vociferously, till he creeps into a thicket of scrub pines,  into which no crow will ever venture, and lies down till he tires out  their patience. In hunting, one may frequently trace the exact course  of a fox which the dogs are driving, by the crows clamoring over him.  Here in the snow was a record that may help explain one side of the  feud.    From the same white page one may read many other stories of Reynard's  ways and doings. Indeed I know of no more interesting winter walk than  an afternoon spent on his last night's trail through the soft snow.  There is always something new, either in the track or the woods  through which it leads; always a fresh hunting story; always a  disappointment or two, a long cold wait for a rabbit that didn't come,  or a miscalculation over the length of the snow tunnel where a  partridge burrowed for the night. Generally, if you follow far enough,  there is also a story of good hunting which leaves you wavering  between congratulation over a successful stalk after nights of hungry,  patient wandering, and pity for the little tragedy told so vividly by  converging trails, a few red drops in the snow, a bit of fur blown  about by the wind, or a feather clinging listlessly to the underbrush.  In such a tramp one learns much of fox-ways and other ways that can  never be learned elsewhere.           *       *       *       *       *    The fox whose life has been spent on the hillsides surrounding a New  England village seems to have profited by generations of experience.  He is much more cunning every way than the fox of the wilderness. If,  for instance, a fox has been stealing your chickens, your trap must be  very cunningly set if you are to catch him. It will not do to set it  near the chickens; no inducement will be great enough to bring him  within yards of it. It must be set well back in the woods, near one of  his regular hunting grounds. Before that, however, you must bait the  fox with choice bits scattered over a pile of dry leaves or chaff,  sometimes for a week, sometimes for a month, till he comes regularly.  Then smoke your trap, or scent it; handle it only with gloves; set it  in the chaff; scatter bait as usual; and you have one chance of  getting him, while he has still a dozen of getting away. In the  wilderness, on the other hand, he may be caught with half the  precaution. I know a little fellow, whose home is far back from the  settlements, who catches five or six foxes every winter by ordinary  wire snares set in the rabbit paths, where foxes love to hunt.    In the wilderness one often finds tracks in the snow, telling how a  fox tried to catch a partridge and only succeeded in frightening it  into a tree. After watching a while hungrily,--one can almost see him  licking his chops under the tree,--he trots off to other hunting  grounds. If he were an educated fox he would know better than that.    When an old New England fox in some of his nightly prowlings discovers  a flock of chickens roosting in the orchard, he generally gets one or  two. His plan is to come by moonlight, or else just at dusk, and,  running about under the tree, bark sharply to attract the chickens'  attention. If near the house, he does this by jumping, lest the dog or  the farmer hear his barking. Once they have begun to flutter and  cackle, as they always do when disturbed, he begins to circle the tree  slowly, still jumping and clacking his teeth. The chickens crane their  necks down to follow him. Faster and faster he goes, racing in small  circles, till some foolish fowl grows dizzy with twisting her head, or  loses her balance and tumbles down, only to be snapped up and carried  off across his shoulders in a twinkling.    But there is one way in which fox of the wilderness and fox of the  town are alike easily deceived. Both are very fond of mice, and  respond quickly to the squeak, which can be imitated perfectly by  drawing the breath in sharply between closed lips. The next thing,  after that is learned, is to find a spot in which to try the effect.    Two or three miles back from almost all New England towns are certain  old pastures and clearings, long since run wild, in which the young  foxes love to meet and play on moonlight nights, much as rabbits do,  though in a less harum-scarum way. When well fed, and therefore in no  hurry to hunt, the heart of a young fox turns naturally to such a  spot, and to fun and capers. The playground may easily be found by  following the tracks after the first snowfall. (The knowledge will not  profit you probably till next season; but it is worth finding and  remembering.) If one goes to the place on some still, bright night in  autumn, and hides on the edge of the open, he stands a good chance of  seeing two or three foxes playing there. Only he must himself be still  as the night; else, should twenty foxes come that way, he will never  see one.    It is always a pretty scene, the quiet opening in the woods flecked  with soft gray shadows in the moonlight, the dark sentinel evergreens  keeping silent watch about the place, the wild little creatures  playing about among the junipers, flitting through light and shadow,  jumping over each other and tumbling about in mimic warfare, all  unconscious of a spectator as the foxes that played there before the  white man came, and before the Indians. Such scenes do not crowd  themselves upon one. He must wait long, and love the woods, and be  often disappointed; but when they come at last, they are worth all the  love and the watching. And when the foxes are not there, there is  always something else that is beautiful.--    Now squeak like a mouse, in the midst of the play. Instantly the fox  nearest you stands, with one foot up, listening. Another squeak, and  he makes three or four swift bounds in your direction, only to stand  listening again; he hasn't quite located you. Careful now! don't  hurry; the longer you keep him waiting, the more certainly he is  deceived. Another squeak; some more swift jumps that bring him  within ten feet; and now he smells or sees you, sitting motionless on  your boulder in the shadow of the pines.    [Illustration]    He isn't surprised; at least he pretends he isn't; but looks you over  indifferently, as if he were used to finding people sitting on that  particular rock. Then he trots off with an air of having forgotten  something. With all his cunning he never suspects you of being the  mouse. That little creature he believes to be hiding under the rock;  and to-morrow night he will very likely take a look there, or respond  to your squeak in the same way.    It is only early in the season, generally before the snow blows, that  one can see them playing; and it is probably the young foxes that are  so eager for this kind of fun. Later in the season--either because the  cubs have lost their playfulness, or because they must hunt so  diligently for enough to eat that there is no time for play--they  seldom do more than take a gallop together, with a playful jump or  two, before going their separate ways. At all times, however, they  have a strong tendency to fun and mischief-making. More than once, in  winter, I have surprised a fox flying round after his own bushy tail  so rapidly that tail and fox together looked like a great yellow  pin-wheel on the snow.    When a fox meets a toad or frog, and is not hungry, he worries the  poor thing for an hour at a time; and when he finds a turtle he turns  the creature over with his paw, sitting down gravely to watch its  awkward struggle to get back onto its feet. At such times he has a"]]]
