Encircling  all was the Empyrean, increate, incorporeal, motionless,  unbounded in time or space, the proper seat of God, the home of  the Angels, the abode of the Elect.    The Angelic Hierarchy consisted of nine orders, corresponding to  the nine moving heavens. Their blessedness and the swiftness of  time motion with which in unending delight they circled around  God were in proportion to their nearness to Him, --first the  Seraphs, then the Cherubs, Thrones, Dominations, Virtues, Powers,  Princes, Archangels, and Angels. Through them, under the general  name of Intelligences, the Divine influence was transmitted to  the Heavens, giving to them their circular motion, which was the  expression of their longing to be united with the source of their  creation. The Heavens in their turn streamed down upon the Earth  the Divine influence thus distributed among them, in varying  proportion and power, producing divers effects in the generation  and corruption of material things, and in the dispositions and  the lives of men.    Such was the general scheme of the Universe. The intention of God  in its creation was to communicate of his own perfection to the  creatures endowed with souls, that is, to men and to angels, and  the proper end of every such creature was to seek its own  perfection in likeness to the Divine. This end was attained  through that knowledge of God of which the soul was capable, and  through love which was in proportion to knowledge. Virtue  depended on the free will of man; it was the good use of that  will directed to a right object of love. Two lights were given to  the soul for guidance of the will: the light of reason for  natural things and for the direction of the will to moral virtue  the light of grace for things supernatural, and for the direction  of the will to spiritual virtue. Sin was the opposite of virtue,  the choice by the will of false objects of love; it involved the  misuse of reason, and the absence of grace. As the end of virtue  was blessedness, so the end of sin was misery.    The cornerstone of Dante's moral system was the Freedom of the  Will; in other words, the right of private judgment with the  condition of accountability. This is the liberty which Dante,  that is man, goes seeking in his journey through the spiritual  world. This liberty is to be attained through the right use of  reason, illuminated by Divine Grace; it consists in the perfect  accord of the will of man with the will of God.    With this view of the nature and end of man Dante's conception of  the history of the race could not be other than that its course  was providentially ordered. The fall of man had made him a just  object of the vengeance of God; but the elect were to be  redeemed, and for their redemption the history of the world from  the beginning was directed. Not only in his dealings with the  Jews, but in his dealings with the heathen was God preparing for  the reconciliation of man, to be finally accomplished in his  sacrifice of Himself for them. The Roman Empire was foreordained  and established for this end. It was to prepare the way for the  establishment of the Roman Church. It was the appointed  instrument for the political government of men. Empire and  Church were alike divine institutions for the guidance of man on  earth.    The aim of Dante in the Divine Comedy was to set forth these  truths in such wise as to affect the imaginations and touch the  hearts of men, so that they should turn to righteousness. His  conviction of these truths was no mere matter of belief; it had  the ardor and certainty of faith. They had appeared to him in all  their fulness as a revelation of the Divine wisdom. It was his  work as poet, as poet with a divine commission, to make this  revelation known. His work was a work of faith; it was sacred; to  it both Heaven and Earth had set their hands.    To this work, as I have said, the definiteness and the limits of  the generally accepted theory of the Universe gave the required  frame. The very narrowness of this scheme made Dante's design  practicable. He had had the experience of a man on earth. He had  been lured by false objects of desire from the pursuit of the  true good. But Divine Grace, in the form of Beatrice, who had of  old on earth led him aright, now intervened and sent to his aid  Virgil, who, as the type of Human Reason, should bring him safe  through Hell, showing to him the eternal consequences of sin, and  then should conduct him, penitent, up the height of Purgatory,  till on its summit, in the Earthly Paradise, Beatrice should  appear once more to him. Thence she, as the type of that  knowledge through which comes the love of God, should lead him,  through the Heavens up to the Empyrean, to the consummation of  his course in the actual vision of God.      AIDS TO THE STUDY OF THE DIVINE COMEDY.    The Essay by Mr. Lowell, to which I have already referred (Dante,  Lowell's Prose Works, vol. iv.) is the best introduction to the  study of the poem. It should be read and re-read.    Dante, an essay by the late Dean Church, is the work of a learned  and sympathetic scholar, and is an excellent treatise on the  life, times, and work of the poet.    The Notes and Illustrations that accompany Mr. Longfellow's  translation of the Divine Comedy form an admirable body of  comment on the poem.    The Rev. Dr. Edward Moore's little volume, on The Time-References  in the Divina Cominedia (London, 1887), is of great value in  making the progress of Dante's journey clear, and in showing  Dante's scrupulous consistency of statement. Dr. Moore's more  recent work, Contributions to the Textual Criticism of the Divina  Commedia (Cambridge, 1889), is to be warmly commended to the  advanced student.    These sources of information are enough for the mere English  reader. But one who desires to make himself a thorough master of  the poem must turn to foreign sources of instruction: to Carl  Witte's invaluable Dante-Forschungen (2 vols. Halle, 1869); to  the comment, especially that on the Paradiso, which accompanies  the German translation of the Divine Comedy by Philalethes. the  late King John of Saxony; to Bartoli's life of Dante in his  Storia della Letteratura Italiana (Firenze, 1878 and subsequent  years), and to Scartazzini's Prolegomeni della Divina Commedia  (Leipzig, 1890). The fourteenth century Comments, especially  those of Boccaccio, of Buti, and of Benvenuto da Imola, are  indispensable to one who would understand the poem as it was  understood by Dante's immediate contemporaries and successors. It  is from them and from the Chronicle of Dante's contemporary and  fellow-citizen, Giovanni Villani, that our knowledge concerning  many of the personages mentioned in the Poem is derived.    In respect to the theology and general doctrine of the Poem, the  Summa Theologica of St. Thomas Aquinas is the main source from  which Dante himself drew.      Of editions of the Divina Commedia in Italian, either that of  Andreoli, or of Bianchi, or of Fraticelli, each in one volume,  may be recommended to the beginner. Scartazzini's edition in  three volumes is the best, in spite of some serious defects, for  the deeper student.      HELL.    CANTO I. Dante, astray in a wood, reaches the foot of a hill  which he begins to ascend; he is hindered by three beasts; he  turns back and is met by Virgil, who proposes to guide him into  the eternal world.      Midway upon the road of our life I found myself within a dark  wood, for the right way had been missed. Ah! how hard a thing it  is to tell what this wild and rough and dense wood was, which in  thought renews the fear! So bitter is it that death is little  more. But in order to treat of the good that there I found, I  will tell of the other things that I have seen there. I cannot  well recount how I entered it, so full was I of slumber at that  point where I abandoned the true way. But after I had arrived at  the foot of a hill, where that valley ended which had pierced my  heart with fear, I looked on high, and saw its shoulders clothed  already with the rays of the planet[1] that leadeth men aright  along every path. Then was the fear a little quieted which in the  lake of my heart had lasted through the night that I passed so  piteously. And even as one who with spent breath, issued out of  the sea upon the shore, turns to the perilous water and gazes, so  did my soul, which still was flying, turn back to look again upon  the pass which never had a living person left.      [1] The sun, a planet according to the Ptolemaic system.      After I had rested a little my weary body I took my way again  along the desert slope, so that the firm foot was always the  lower. And lo! almost at the beginning of the steep a  she-leopard, light and very nimble, which was covered with a  spotted coat. And she did not move from before my face, nay,  rather hindered so my road that to return I oftentimes had  turned.    The time was at the beginning of the morning, and the Sun was  mounting upward with those stars that were with him when Love  Divine first set in motion those beautiful things;[1] so that the  hour of the time and the sweet season were occasion of good hope  to me concerning that wild beast with the dappled skin. But not  so that the sight which appeared to me of a lion did not give me  fear. He seemed to be coming against me, with head high and with  ravening hunger, so that it seemed that the air was affrighted at  him. And a she-wolf,[2] who with all cravings seemed laden in her  meagreness, and already had made many folk to live forlorn,--she  caused me so much heaviness, with the fear that came from sight  of her, that I lost hope of the height And such as he is who  gaineth willingly, and the time arrives that makes him lose, who  in all his thoughts weeps and is sad,--such made me the"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19950"],[0,"Summa Theologica, Part III (Tertia Pars) (#3)"],[1,"17): \"Since human nature is so united to God as to become one  person, let not these proud spirits dare to prefer themselves to man,  because they have no bodies.\" Secondly, because we are thereby taught  how great is man's dignity, lest we should sully it with sin; hence  Augustine says (De Vera Relig. xvi): \"God has proved to us how high a  place human nature holds amongst creatures, inasmuch as He appeared  to men as a true man.\" And Pope Leo says in a sermon on the Nativity  (xxi): \"Learn, O Christian, thy worth; and being made a partner of  the Divine nature, refuse to return by evil deeds to your former  worthlessness.\" Thirdly, because, \"in order to do away with man's  presumption, the grace of God is commended in Jesus Christ, though no  merits of ours went before,\" as Augustine says (De Trin. xiii, 17).  Fourthly, because \"man's pride, which is the greatest stumbling-block  to our clinging to God, can be convinced and cured by humility so  great,\" as Augustine says in the same place. Fifthly, in order to  free man from the thraldom of sin, which, as Augustine says (De Trin.  xiii, 13), \"ought to be done in such a way that the devil should be  overcome by the justice of the man Jesus Christ,\" and this was done  by Christ satisfying for us. Now a mere man could not have satisfied  for the whole human race, and God was not bound to satisfy; hence it  behooved Jesus Christ to be both God and man. Hence Pope Leo says in  the same sermon: \"Weakness is assumed by strength, lowliness by  majesty, mortality by eternity, in order that one and the same  Mediator of God and men might die in one and rise in the other--for  this was our fitting remedy. Unless He was God, He would not have  brought a remedy; and unless He was man, He would not have set an  example.\"    And there are very many other advantages which accrued, above man's  apprehension.    Reply Obj. 1: This reason has to do with the first kind of necessity,  without which we cannot attain to the end.    Reply Obj. 2: Satisfaction may be said to be sufficient in two  ways--first, perfectly, inasmuch as it is condign, being adequate to  make good the fault committed, and in this way the satisfaction of a  mere man cannot be sufficient for sin, both because the whole of  human nature has been corrupted by sin, whereas the goodness of any  person or persons could not be made up adequately for the harm done  to the whole of the nature; and also because a sin committed against  God has a kind of infinity from the infinity of the Divine majesty,  because the greater the person we offend, the more grievous the  offense. Hence for condign satisfaction it was necessary that the act  of the one satisfying should have an infinite efficiency, as being of  God and man. Secondly, man's satisfaction may be termed sufficient,  imperfectly--i.e. in the acceptation of him who is content with it,  even though it is not condign, and in this way the satisfaction of a  mere man is sufficient. And forasmuch as every imperfect presupposes  some perfect thing, by which it is sustained, hence it is that  satisfaction of every mere man has its efficiency from the  satisfaction of Christ.    Reply Obj. 3: By taking flesh, God did not lessen His majesty; and in  consequence did not lessen the reason for reverencing Him, which is  increased by the increase of knowledge of Him. But, on the contrary,  inasmuch as He wished to draw nigh to us by taking flesh, He greatly  drew us to know Him.  _______________________    THIRD ARTICLE [III, Q. 1, Art. 3]    Whether, If Man Had Not Sinned, God Would Have Become Incarnate?    Objection 1: It would seem that if man had not sinned, God would  still have become incarnate. For the cause remaining, the effect also  remains. But as Augustine says (De Trin. xiii, 17): \"Many other  things are to be considered in the Incarnation of Christ besides  absolution from sin\"; and these were discussed above (A. 2).  Therefore if man had not sinned, God would have become incarnate.    Obj. 2: Further, it belongs to the omnipotence of the Divine power to  perfect His works, and to manifest Himself by some infinite effect.  But no mere creature can be called an infinite effect, since it is  finite of its very essence. Now, seemingly, in the work of the  Incarnation alone is an infinite effect of the Divine power  manifested in a special manner by which power things infinitely  distant are united, inasmuch as it has been brought about that man is  God. And in this work especially the universe would seem to be  perfected, inasmuch as the last creature--viz. man--is united to the  first principle--viz. God. Therefore, even if man had not sinned, God  would have become incarnate.    Obj. 3: Further, human nature has not been made more capable of grace  by sin. But after sin it is capable of the grace of union, which is  the greatest grace. Therefore, if man had not sinned, human nature  would have been capable of this grace; nor would God have withheld  from human nature any good it was capable of. Therefore, if man had  not sinned, God would have become incarnate.    Obj. 4: Further, God's predestination is eternal. But it is said of  Christ (Rom. 1:4): \"Who was predestined the Son of God in power.\"  Therefore, even before sin, it was necessary that the Son of God  should become incarnate, in order to fulfil God's predestination.    Obj. 5: Further, the mystery of the Incarnation was revealed to the  first man, as is plain from Gen. 2:23. \"This now is bone of my  bones,\" etc. which the Apostle says is \"a great sacrament . . . in  Christ and in the Church,\" as is plain from Eph. 5:32. But man could  not be fore-conscious of his fall, for the same reason that the  angels could not, as Augustine proves (Gen. ad lit. xi, 18).  Therefore, even if man had not sinned, God would have become  incarnate.    _On the contrary,_ Augustine says (De Verb. Apost. viii, 2),  expounding what is set down in Luke 19:10, \"For the Son of Man is  come to seek and to save that which was lost\"; \"Therefore, if man had  not sinned, the Son of Man would not have come.\" And on 1 Tim. 1:15,  \"Christ Jesus came into this world to save sinners,\" a gloss says,  \"There was no cause of Christ's coming into the world, except to save  sinners. Take away diseases, take away wounds, and there is no need  of medicine.\"    _I answer that,_ There are different opinions about this question.  For some say that even if man had not sinned, the Son of Man would  have become incarnate. Others assert the contrary, and seemingly our  assent ought rather to be given to this opinion.    For such things as spring from God's will, and beyond the creature's  due, can be made known to us only through being revealed in the  Sacred Scripture, in which the Divine Will is made known to us.  Hence, since everywhere in the Sacred Scripture the sin of the first  man is assigned as the reason of the Incarnation, it is more in  accordance with this to say that the work of the Incarnation was  ordained by God as a remedy for sin; so that, had sin not existed,  the Incarnation would not have been. And yet the power of God is not  limited to this; even had sin not existed, God could have become  incarnate.    Reply Obj. 1: All the other causes which are assigned in the  preceding article have to do with a remedy for sin. For if man had  not sinned, he would have been endowed with the light of Divine  wisdom, and would have been perfected by God with the righteousness  of justice in order to know and carry out everything needful. But  because man, on deserting God, had stooped to corporeal things, it  was necessary that God should take flesh, and by corporeal things  should afford him the remedy of salvation. Hence, on John 1:14, \"And  the Word was made flesh,\" St. Augustine says (Tract. ii): \"Flesh had  blinded thee, flesh heals thee; for Christ came and overthrew the  vices of the flesh.\"    Reply Obj. 2: The infinity of Divine power is shown in the mode of  production of things from nothing. Again, it suffices for the  perfection of the universe that the creature be ordained in a natural  manner to God as to an end. But that a creature should be united to  God in person exceeds the limits of the perfection of nature.    Reply Obj. 3: A double capability may be remarked in human nature:  one, in respect of the order of natural power, and this is always  fulfilled by God, Who apportions to each according to its natural  capability; the other in respect to the order of the Divine power,  which all creatures implicitly obey; and the capability we speak of  pertains to this. But God does not fulfil all such capabilities,  otherwise God could do only what He has done in creatures, and this  is false, as stated above (I, Q. 105, A. 6). But there is no reason  why human nature should not have been raised to something greater  after sin. For God allows evils to happen in order to bring a greater  good therefrom; hence it is written (Rom. 5:20): \"Where sin abounded,  grace did more abound.\" Hence, too, in the blessing of the Paschal  candle, we say: \"O happy fault, that merited such and so great a  Redeemer!\"    Reply Obj. 4: Predestination presupposes the foreknowledge of future  things; and hence, as God predestines the salvation of anyone to be  brought about by the prayers of others, so also He predestined the  work of the Incarnation to be the remedy of human sin.    Reply Obj. 5: Nothing prevents an effect from being revealed to one  to whom the cause is not revealed. Hence, the mystery of the  Incarnation could be revealed to the first man without his being  fore-conscious of his fall. For not everyone who knows the effect  knows the cause.  _______________________    FOURTH ARTICLE [III, Q. 1, Art. 4]    Whether God Became Incarnate in Order to Take Away Actual Sin, Rather  Than to Take Away Original Sin?    Objection 1: It would seem that God became incarnate as a remedy for  actual sins rather than for original sin. For the "]]]
