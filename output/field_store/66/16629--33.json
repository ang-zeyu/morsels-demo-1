I love       to think on thee, pretty, quiet D----, thou pattern of an       English country town, with thy clean but narrow streets       branching out from thy modest market-place, with their       old-fashioned houses, with here and there a roof of venerable       thatch, with thy one half-aristocratic mansion, where resided       the Lady Bountiful--she, the generous and kind, who loved to       visit the sick, leaning on her golden-headed cane, while the       sleek old footman walked at a respectful distance behind.       Pretty, quiet D----, with thy venerable church, in which       moulder the mortal remains of England's sweetest and most pious       bard.    Then follows an exquisite eulogy of the poet Cowper, which readers of  _Lavengro_ know full well. Three years before Borrow was born William  Cowper died in this very town, leaving behind him so rich a legacy of  poetry and of prose, and moreover so fragrant a memory of a life in  which humour and pathos played an equal part. It was no small thing for  a youth who aspired to any kind of renown to be born in the  neighbourhood of the last resting-place of the author of _The Task_.    Yet Borrow was not actually born in East Dereham, but a mile and a half  away, at the little hamlet of Dumpling Green, in what was then a  glorious wilderness of common and furze bush, but is now a quiet  landscape of fields and hedges. You will find the home in which the  author of _Lavengro_ first saw the light without much difficulty. It is  a fair-sized farm-house, with a long low frontage separated from the  road by a considerable strip of garden. It suggests a prosperous yeoman  class, and I have known farm-houses in East Anglia not one whit larger  dignified by the name of 'hall.' Nearly opposite is a pond. The trim  hedges are a delight to us to-day, but you must cast your mind back to a  century ago when they were entirely absent. The house belonged to George  Borrow's maternal grandfather, Samuel Perfrement, who farmed the  adjacent land at this time. Samuel and Mary Perfrement had eight  children, the third of whom, Ann, was born in 1772.    In February 1793 Ann Perfrement, aged twenty-one, married Thomas Borrow,  aged thirty-five, in the Parish Church of East Dereham, and of the two  children that were born to them George Henry Borrow was the younger.  Thomas Borrow was the son of one John Borrow of St. Cleer in Cornwall,  who died before this child was born, and is described by his  grandson[3] as the scion 'of an ancient but reduced Cornish family,  tracing descent from the de Burghs, and entitled to carry their arms.'  This claim, of which I am thoroughly sceptical, is endorsed by Dr.  Knapp,[4] who, however, could find no trace of the family earlier than  1678, the old parish registers having been destroyed. When Thomas Borrow  was born the family were in any case nothing more than small farmers,  and Thomas Borrow and his brothers were working on the land in the  intervals of attending the parish school. At the age of eighteen Thomas  was apprenticed to a maltster at Liskeard, and about this time he joined  the local Militia. Tradition has it that his career as a maltster was  cut short by his knocking his master down in a scrimmage. The victor  fled from the scene of his prowess, and enlisted as a private soldier in  the Coldstream Guards. This was in 1783, and in 1792 he was transferred  to the West Norfolk Militia; hence his appearance at East Dereham,  where, now a serjeant, his occupations for many a year were recruiting  and drilling.[5] It is recorded that at a theatrical performance at East  Dereham he first saw, presumably on the stage of the county-hall, his  future wife--Ann Perfrement. She was, it seems, engaged in a minor part  in a travelling company, not, we may assume, altogether with the  sanction of her father, who, in spite of his inheritance of French  blood, doubtless shared the then very strong English prejudice against  the stage. However, Ann was one of eight children, and had, as we shall  find in after years, no inconsiderable strength of character, and so may  well at twenty years of age have decided upon a career for herself. In  any case we need not press too hard the Cornish and French origin of  George Borrow to explain his wandering tendencies, nor need we wonder at  the suggestion of Nathaniel Hawthorne, that he was 'supposed to be of  gypsy descent by the mother's side.' You have only to think of the  father, whose work carried him from time to time to every corner of  England, Scotland, and Ireland, and of the mother with her reminiscence  of life in a travelling theatrical company, to explain in no small  measure the glorious vagabondage of George Borrow.    Behold then Thomas Borrow and Ann Perfrement as man and wife, he being  thirty-five years of age, she twenty-one. A roving, restless life was in  front of the pair for many a day, the West Norfolk Militia being  stationed in some eight or nine separate towns within the interval of  ten years between Thomas Borrow's marriage and his second son's birth.  The first child, John Thomas Borrow, was born on the 15th April 1801.[6]  The second son, George Henry Borrow, the subject of this memoir, was  born in his grandfather's house at Dumpling Green, East Dereham, his  mother having found a natural refuge with her father while her husband  was busily recruiting in Norfolk. The two children passed with their  parents from place to place, and in 1809 we find them once again in  East Dereham. From his son's two books, _Lavengro_ and _Wild Wales_, we  can trace the father's later wanderings until his final retirement to  Norwich on a pension. In 1810 the family were at Norman Cross in  Huntingdonshire, when Captain Borrow had to assist in guarding the  French prisoners of war; for it was the stirring epoch of the Napoleonic  conflict, and within the temporary prison 'six thousand French and other  foreigners, followers of the Grand Corsican, were now immured.'         What a strange appearance had those mighty casernes, with their       blank blind walls, without windows or grating, and their       slanting roofs, out of which, through orifices where the tiles       had been removed, would be protruded dozens of grim heads,       feasting their prison-sick eyes on the wide expanse of country       unfolded from that airy height. Ah! there was much misery in       those casernes; and from those roofs, doubtless, many a wistful       look was turned in the direction of lovely France. Much had the       poor inmates to endure, and much to complain of, to the       disgrace of England be it said--of England, in general so kind       and bountiful. Rations of carrion meat, and bread from which I       have seen the very hounds occasionally turn away, were unworthy       entertainment even for the most ruffian enemy, when helpless       and a captive; and such, alas! was the fare in those casernes.    But here we have only to do with Thomas Borrow, of whom we get many a  quaint glimpse in _Lavengro_, our first and our last being concerned  with him in the one quality that his son seems to have inherited, as the  associate of a prize-fighter--Big Ben Brain. Borrow records in his  opening chapter that Ben Brain and his father met in Hyde Park probably  in 1790, and that after an hour's conflict 'the champions shook hands  and retired, each having experienced quite enough of the other's  prowess.' Borrow further relates that four months afterwards Brain 'died  in the arms of my father, who read to him the Bible in his last  moments.' Dr. Knapp finds Borrow in one of his many inaccuracies or  rather 'imaginings' here, as Brain did not die until 1794. More than  once in his after years the old soldier seems to have had a shy pride in  that early conflict, although the piety which seems to have come to him  with the responsibilities of wife and children led him to count any  recalling of the episode as a 'temptation.' When Borrow was about  thirteen years of age, he overheard his father and mother discussing  their two boys, the elder being the father's favourite and George the  mother's:         'I will hear nothing against my first-born,' said my father,       'even in the way of insinuation: he is my joy and pride; the       very image of myself in my youthful days, long before I fought       Big Ben, though perhaps not quite so tall or strong built. As       for the other, God bless the child! I love him, I'm sure; but I       must be blind not to see the difference between him and his       brother. Why, he has neither my hair nor my eyes; and then his       countenance! why, 'tis absolutely swarthy, God forgive me! I       had almost said like that of a gypsy, but I have nothing to say       against that; the boy is not to be blamed for the colour of his       face, nor for his hair and eyes; but, then, his ways and       manners!--I confess I do not like them, and that they give me       no little uneasiness.'[7]    Borrow throughout his narrative refers to his father as 'a man of  excellent common sense,' and he quotes the opinion of William Taylor,  who had rather a bad reputation as a 'freethinker' with all the  church-going citizens of Norwich, with no little pride. Borrow is of  course the 'young man' of the dialogue. He was then eighteen years of  age:         'Not so, not so,' said the young man eagerly; 'before I knew       you I knew nothing, and am still very ignorant; but of late my       father's health has been very much broken, and he requires       attention; his spirits also have become low, which, to tell you       the truth, he attributes to my misconduct. He says that I have       imbibed all kinds of strange notions and doctrines, which will,       in all probability, prove my ruin, both here and hereafter;       which--which----'         'Ah!"]],[[2,"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19769"],[0,"The Brochure Series of Architectural Illustration, Vol. 01, No. 08, August 1895 (#3)"],[1,"of the charm of the club is due  to this absolute freedom from restraint.    The officers are the president, treasurer, and secretary, who manage the  affairs of the club during their term of office. Each member presides in  turn, the term of office being one month, the succession being arranged  by lot.    A well-known writer deplores the lack of humor in the fiction of the  day, and the tendency of those who should know better, to constantly  preach us sermons upon our least admirable failings.    Alas! it is not fiction alone that has taken to the pulpit, for  Architecture has also its preachers, and our journals are loaded with  their sermons, which fortunately for architecture, very few ever read.    While acknowledging the fact that a little seriousness now and then may  be relished by even a P. D., a good hearty laugh is the one thing in  this dreary old world of ours that they most appreciate. No one realizes  more thoroughly than they that,--        \"Care to our coffin adds a nail, no doubt,      And every grin so jolly draws one out.\"    The principal object of the members, then, is to amuse themselves. The  club is not intended as a workroom, but as our P. D. poet expresses it,  a place where,--        \"Freed from the fret of routine's slavish toil,        They meet once more in freedom's jollity.      No thought of care comes to them now to spoil        The merry jest, the gay frivolity.\"    Nevertheless they have found time for much serious work, but inasmuch as  work is said to speak for itself, we will confine our attention to some  of the things by means of which the members have passed many happy  hours.    Upon entering the club the member not only receives a new name, but his  biography containing more or less of the truth about him is written and  placed in the records. A song is also composed in his honor, and on  festal occasions he is greeted with it upon his entrance.    Perhaps the greatest event of the year is the annual dinner, or the  \"Centurial Dinner\" as it is called, from the very general conviction  that \"Better one year with the P. D.'s than a cycle of Cathay.\" Every  one is supposed to do something for this occasion, but he is given  perfect liberty as to what he shall do, and he may answer, for instance,  the toast of The Architecture of the Greeks with an essay on The Use and  Abuse of the Cocktail, with the assurance that his consistency will not  be doubted.    The menu card is usually of sufficient interest to furnish amusement  until the actual hostilities begin. Upon each guest at this dinner is  conferred the honorary title of \"Draughtsman.\"    The installation of a new president, which occurs monthly, is also the  occasion of much mirth, as are also the departures for or the arrivals  from Europe of members.    But no matter how closely these events follow each other, one can depend  upon each of them being distinctly different; and after one has attended  a score or so of them he begins to wonder when this versatility will end  and they will begin to repeat themselves.    Notwithstanding the unvaried success of these affairs, none of them have  been attended with more than a slight expenditure of time or money.    In decorating the rooms the same old articles have been made to do  service any number of times, but always in such a manner as to obtain an  entirely different effect.    Many of the best things in this line have been done on the spur of the  moment. The club seal, for instance, was thrown together in a few  minutes, some one in the meantime looking up an appropriate motto, the  occasion being an impromptu festival of Gambrinus, which occurred one  Christmas eve.    At another time a wonderful chandelier was constructed of a stretcher, a  Chinese lantern, and twenty beer bottles, which were utilized to hold  candles, and a placard on each told that they were manufactured by the  P. D. Electric Co. and were each of one candle power; the whole being  draped with some brilliantly dyed stuffs that had served as costumes at  the Art Students' Festival.    _(To be continued.)_"]]]
