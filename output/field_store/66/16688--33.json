Sufder would be angry, indeed, were he to find  that you did not remain here; and would blame me for it. I should  be willing enough for you to stay a week, or a month; that is a  different thing from becoming an inmate of the house.\"    \"I will wait till tomorrow, for I have made a long two days'  journey from the top of the Ghauts and, as I am not accustomed to  walking, my feet are sore. In the morning I will go and see my  brother. I did not so much as know that he was alive. I feel sure  he will take me in, willingly; for he is but two years older than  myself, and was always kind to me.\"    Accordingly the next morning she retraced her steps, and had no  difficulty in finding the farm of Ramdass. Choosing the time when  he would be likely to be in for his dinner, Soyera walked up to the  door of the house, which was standing open.    As she stood there, hesitating, Ramdass came out. He was a man of  some forty years of age, with a pleasant and kindly face. He looked  at her enquiringly.    \"Do you not know me, Ramdass?\" she asked.    \"Why, 'tis Soyera!\" he exclaimed. \"And so you have come back, after  all these years--thirteen, is it not, since you went away?    \"Welcome back, little sister!\" and he raised his voice, and called,  \"Anundee!\"    A young woman, two or three and twenty years of age, came to the  door.    \"Wife,\" he said, \"this is my sister Soyera, of whom you have often  heard me speak.    \"Soyera, this is my wife. We have been married six years; but come  in, and let us talk things over.    \"You have come home for good, I hope,\" he said. \"So you too have  married and, as you come alone with your child, have, I suppose,  had the misfortune to lose your husband?\"    \"Yes, I was alone in the world, and came hither not knowing whether  you were alive or dead; but feeling sure of a welcome, if I found  you.\"    \"And you were not mistaken,\" he said heartily.    \"Anundee, you will, I am sure, join me in the welcome; and  willingly give my sister and her child a place in our home?\"    \"Assuredly. It will be pleasant for me, when you are in the fields,  to have some one to talk to, and perhaps to help me about the  house.\"    Soyera saw that she was speaking sincerely.    \"Thank you, Anundee; you may be sure that I shall not be idle. I  have been accustomed to work, and can take much off your hands; and  will look after your two children;\" for two boys, three or four  years old, were standing before her, staring at the newcomer.    \"That will be pleasant, Soyera; indeed, sometimes they hinder me  much in my work.\"    \"I am accustomed to children, Anundee, as I was for years nurse to  English children, and know their ways.\"    \"Well, now let us to dinner,\" Ramdass broke in. \"I am hungry, and  want to be off again. There is much to do in the fields.\"    The woman took a pot off the embers of a wood fire, and poured its  contents into a dish. The meal consisted of a species of pulse  boiled with ghee, with peppers and other condiments added.    \"And how did you like being among the English, Soyera?\"    \"I liked it very well,\" the woman said. \"They are very kind and  considerate to nurses and, although they get angry when the  gorrawallah or other men neglect their duty, they do not punish  them as a Mahratta master would do. They are not double faced; when  they say a thing they mean it, and their word can always be  trusted. As a people, no doubt they are anxious to extend their  dominion; but they do not wish to do so for personal gain. They are  not like the princes here, who go to war to gain territory and  revenue. It was reasonable that they should wish to increase their  lands; for they are almost shut up in Bombay, with Salsette and the  other islands occupied by us, who may, any day, be their enemies.\"    Her brother laughed.    \"It seems to me, Soyera, that you have come to prefer these English  people to your own countrymen.\"    \"I say not that, Ramdass. You asked me how I liked them, and I have  told you. You yourself know how the tax collectors grind down the  people; how Scindia and Holkar and the Peishwa are always fighting  each other. Do you know that, in Bombay, the meanest man could not  be put to death, unless fairly tried; while among the Mahrattas men  are executed on the merest excuse or, if not executed, are  murdered?\"    \"That is true enough,\" Ramdass said; \"none of the three princes  would hesitate to put to death anyone who stood in his way, and it  seems strange to me that even the Brahmins, who would not take the  life even of a troublesome insect, yet support the men who have  killed scores of other people. But it is no use grumbling; the  thing has always been, and I suppose always will be. It is not only  so in the Deccan, but in the Nizam's dominions, in Mysore and, so  far as I know, in Oude and Delhi. It seems so natural to us that  the powerful should oppress the weak, and that one prince should go  to war with another, that we hardly give the matter a thought; but  though, as you say, the English in Bombay may rule wisely, and  dislike taking life, they are doing now just as our princes  do--they are making war with us.\"    \"That is true but, from what I have heard when the English sahibs  were speaking together, it is everything to them that a prince  favourable to them should rule at Poonah for, were Holkar and  Scindia to become all powerful, and place one of their people on  the seat of the Peishwa, the next step might be that a great  Mahratta force would descend the Ghauts, capture Bombay, and slay  every white man in it.\"    \"But they are a mere handful,\" Ramdass said. \"How can they think of  invading a nation like ours?\"    \"Because they know, at least they believe, that Scindia, Holkar,  and the Peishwa are all so jealous of each other that they will  never act together. Then you see what they have done round Madras  and Bengal and, few as they are, they have won battles against the  great princes; and lastly, my mistress has told me that, although  there are but few here, there are many at home; and they could, if  they chose, send out twenty soldiers for every one there is here.    \"Besides, it is not these alone who fight. The natives enlist under  them, and aid them in their conquests; and this shows, at least,  that they are well treated, and have confidence in the good faith  of the English.\"    \"It is all very well, Soyera, to talk that way; but I would as  willingly believe that the stars will fall from the sky as that  these Englishmen, who simply live in Bombay because we suffer them  to do so, should ever conquer the Mahrattas, as they have subdued  other portions of India where, as everyone knows, the people are  not warlike, and have always been conquered without difficulty.    \"Look at our power! At Delhi the emperor is a puppet in our hands,  and it is the same in all the districts on the plain of the great  river. The Rajpoots fear us, and even the Pindaries would not dare  carry their raids into our country. That a small body of merchants  and soldiers should threaten us seems, to me, altogether absurd.\"    \"Well, brother, we will not argue about it. Time will show. As a  woman of the Mahrattas, I trust that day will never come; but as  one who knows the English, I have my fears. Of one thing I am sure,  that were they masters here, the cultivators would be vastly better  off than they are at present.\"    Ramdass laughed.    \"What do you think of my sister's opinions, Anundee?\"    \"I do not know what to think,\" the young woman said; \"but Soyera  has seen much, and is a wise woman, and what she says are no idle  words. To us it seems impossible, when we know that the Mahrattas  can place a hundred thousand horsemen in the field; but I own that,  from what we know of the English, it might be better for people  like us to have such masters.\"    \"And now, Soyera,\" Ramdass said, when he returned from his work in  the evening, \"tell us more about yourself. First, how did you learn  where I was living?\"    \"I learned it from the wife of our cousin Sufder.\"    \"How did you fall in with him?\"    \"Well, I must tell you something. I had meant to keep it entirely  to myself, but I know that you and Anundee will keep my secret.\"    \"Assuredly we will. I am not a man to talk of other people's  affairs and, as to Anundee, you can trust her with your life.\"    \"Well, in the first place, I deceived you; or rather you deceived  yourself, when you said, 'I see that you have been married;' but  the children were here, and so I could not explain. The infant is  not mine. It is the son of my dear master and mistress, both of  whom were killed, three days ago, by bands--of which Sufder  commanded one--who attacked them suddenly, by night.\"    \"What! Is the child white?\" Ramdass asked, in a tone of alarm.    \"It is not white, because I have stained the skin; but it is the  child of English parents. I will tell you how it happened.\"    And she related the instances of the attack upon the little camp,  the death of her master and mistress, another white officer, and  all their escort; told how she had hidden the child under the cover  of the tent, how Sufder had saved her life, and her subsequent  conversation with him regarding the child.    \"Now, what do you intend to do with him, Soyera?\"    \"I intend to bring him up as my own. I shall keep his skin stained,  and no one can suspect that he is not mine.\"    \"Then you do not think of restoring him to his people?\"    \"Not until he grows up. He has neither father nor mother, and to  whom could I hand him, now? Moreover if, as you say, our people  intend to drive the English from Bombay, his fate would be certain.  When I am by myself with him, I shall talk to him in English, as  soon as he is old enough to understand that he must not speak in  that language to others; then, when he joins his own people, he  will be able to converse with them.

Having  introduced my readers to The Woodlands, it is time for the story to  begin.          CHAPTER II    A Friend from the Bush      Ulyth Stanton was a decided personality in the Lower Fifth. If not  exactly pretty, she was a dainty little damsel, and knew how to make the  best of herself. Her fair hair was glossy and waved in the most becoming  fashion, her clothes were well cut, her gloves and shoes immaculate. She  had an artistic temperament, and loved to be surrounded by pretty  things. She was rather a favourite at The Woodlands, for she had few  sharp angles and possessed a fair share of tact. If the girls laughed  sometimes at what they called her \"high-falutin' notions\" they  nevertheless respected her opinions and admired her more than they  always chose to admit. It was an accepted fact that Ulyth stuck to her  word and generally carried through anything that she once undertook. She  alone of six members of her form who had begun to correspond with girls  abroad, at the instigation of the magazine editor, had written  regularly, and had cultivated the overseas friendship with enthusiasm.  The element of romance about the affair had appealed to Ulyth. It was so  strange to receive letters from someone you had never seen. To be sure,  Rona had only given a somewhat bald account of her home and her doings,  but even this outline was so different from English life that Ulyth's  imagination filled the gaps, and pictured her unknown correspondent  among scenes of unrivalled interest and excitement. Ulyth had once seen  a most wonderful film entitled \"Rose of the Wilderness\", and though the  scenes depicted were supposed to be in the region of the Wild West, she  decided that they would equally well represent the backwoods of New  Zealand, and that the beautiful, dashing, daring heroine, so aptly  called \"the Prairie Flower\", was probably a speaking likeness of Rona  Mitchell. When she learnt that owing to her letters Rona's father had  determined to send his daughter to school at The Woodlands, her  excitement was immense. She had at once petitioned Miss Bowes to have  her as a room-mate, and was now awaiting her advent with the very  keenest anticipation.    There was a little uncertainty about the time of the new girl's arrival,  for it depended upon the punctuality of the ocean liner, a doubtful  matter if there were a storm; and the feeling that she might be expected  any hour between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. made havoc of Ulyth's day. It was  impossible to attend to lessons when she was listening for the sound of  a taxi on the drive, and even the attractions of tennis could not decoy  her out of sight of the front door.    \"I must be the very first to welcome her,\" she persisted. \"Of course  it's not the same to all the rest of you--I understand that. She's to be  my special property, my Prairie Rose!\"    \"All serene! If you care to waste your time lounging about the steps you  can. We're not in such a frantic state to see your paragon,\" laughed the  girls as they ran down the garden to the courts. After all, the waiting  was in vain. Tea-time came without a sign of the new-comer. It was  unlikely that she would turn up now until the evening train, and Ulyth  resigned herself to the inevitable. But when the school was almost  half-way through its bread and butter and gooseberry jam, a sudden  commotion occurred in the hall. There was a noise such as nobody ever  remembered to have heard at The Woodlands before.    \"Thank goodness gracious I've got meself here at last!\" cried a loud  nasal voice. \"Where'll I stick these things? Oh yes, there's heaps more  inside that automobile! Travelling's no joke, I can tell you; I'm tired  to death. Any tea about? I could drink the sea. My gracious, I've had a  time of it coming here!\"    At the first word Miss Bowes had glided from the room, and the voice  died away as the door of her private study closed. Sounds suggestive of  the carrying upstairs of luggage followed, and a hinnying laugh echoed  once down the stairs. The girls looked at one another; there was a  shadow in Ulyth's eyes. She did not share in the general smile that  passed round the table, and she finished her tea in dead silence.    \"Going to sample your new property?\" whispered Mary Acton as the girls  pushed back their chairs.    \"What's the formula for swearing an undying friendship?\" giggled Addie  Knighton.    \"Was it Rose of Sharon you called her?\" twinkled Christine Crosswood.  \"Or Lily of the Valley?\"    Ulyth did not reply. She walked upstairs very slowly. The nasal twang of  that high-pitched voice in the hall had wiped the bloom off her  anticipation. The small double dormitory in which she slept was No. 3,  Room 5. The door was half-open, so she entered without knocking. Both  beds, the chairs, and most of the floor was strewn with an assortment of  miscellaneous articles. On the dressing-table was a tray with the  remains of tea. Over a large cabin trunk bent a girl of fourteen. She  straightened herself as she heard footsteps.    Alas! alas! for Ulyth's illusions. The enchanting vision of the prairie  flower faded, and Rona Mitchell stood before her in solid fact. Solid  was the word for it--no fascinating cinema heroine this, but an  ordinary, well-grown, decidedly plump damsel with brown elf locks, a  ruddy sunburnt complexion, and a freckled nose.    Where, oh, where, were the delicate features, the fairy-like figure, and  the long rich clustering curls of Rose of the Wilderness? Ulyth stood  for a moment gazing as one dazed; then, with an effort, she remembered  her manners and introduced herself.    \"Proud to meet you at last,\" replied the new-comer heartily. \"You and  I've had a friendship switched on for us ready-made, so to speak. I  liked your letters awfully. Glad they've put us in together.\"    \"Did--did you have a nice journey?\" stammered Ulyth.    It was a most conventional enquiry, but the only thing she could think  of to say.    \"Beastly! It was rough or hot all the time, and we didn't get much fun  on board. Wasn't it a sell? Too disappointing for words! Mrs. Perkins,  the lady who had charge of me coming over, was just a Tartar. Nothing I  did seemed to suit her somehow. I bet she was glad to see the last of  me. Then I was sea-sick, and when we got into the hot zone--my, how bad  I was! My face was just skinned with sunburn, and the salt air made it  worse. I'd not go to sea again for pleasure, I can tell you. I say, I'll  be glad to get my things fixed up here.\"    \"This is your bed and your side of the room,\" returned Ulyth hastily,  collecting some of the articles which had been flung anywhere, and  hanging them in Rona's wardrobe; \"Miss Moseley makes us be very tidy.  She'll be coming round this evening to inspect.\"    Rona whistled.    \"Guess she'll drop on me pretty often then! No one's ever called  neatness my strong point. Are those photos on the mantelpiece your home  folks? I'm going to look at them. What a lot of things you've got:  books, and albums, and goodness knows what! I'll enjoy turning them over  when I've time.\"    At half-past eight that night a few members of the Lower Fifth, putting  away books in their classroom, stopped to compare notes.    \"Well, what do you think of your adorable one, Ulyth?\" asked Stephanie  Radford, a little spitefully. \"You're welcome to her company so far as  I'm concerned.\"    \"Rose of the Wilderness, indeed!\" mocked Merle Denham.    \"Your prairie rose is nothing but a dandelion!\" remarked Christine  Crosswood.    \"I never heard anyone with such an awful laugh,\" said Lizzie Lonsdale.    \"Don't!\" implored Ulyth tragically. \"I've had the shock of my life.  She's--oh, she's too terrible for words! Her voice makes me cringe. And  she pawed all my things. She snatched up my photos, and turned over my  books with sticky fingers; she even opened my drawers and peeped  inside.\"    \"What cheek!\"    \"Oh, she hasn't the slightest idea of how to behave herself! She asked  me a whole string of the most impertinent questions: what I'd paid for  my clothes, and how long they'd have to last me. She's unbearable. Yes,  absolutely impossible. Ugh! and I've got to sleep in the same room with  her to-night.\"    \"Poor martyr, it's hard luck,\" sympathized Lizzie. \"Why did you write  and ask the Rainbow to put you together? It was rather buying a pig in a  poke, wasn't it?\"    \"I never dreamt she'd be like this. It sounded so romantic, you see,  living on a huge farm, and having two horses to ride. I shall go to Miss  Bowes, first thing to-morrow morning, and ask to have her moved out of  my room. I only wish there was time to do it this evening. Oh, why did I  ever write to her and make her want to come to this school?\"    \"Poor old Ulyth! You've certainly let yourself in for more than you  bargained for,\" laughed the girls, half sorry for her and half amused.    Next morning, after breakfast, the very instant that Miss Bowes was  installed in her study, a \"rap-tap-tap\" sounded on her door.    \"Come in!\" she called, and sighed as Ulyth entered, for she had a shrewd  suspicion of what she was about to hear.    \"Please, Miss Bowes, I'm sorry to have to ask a favour, but may Rona be  changed into another dormitory?\"    \"Why, Ulyth, you wrote to me specially and asked if you might have her  for a room-mate!\"    \"Yes, I did; but I hadn't seen her then. I thought she'd be so  different.\"    \"Isn't it a little too soon to judge? You haven't known her twenty-four  hours yet.\"    \"I know as much of her as I ever want to. Oh, Miss Bowes, she's  dreadful! I'll never like her. I can't have her in my room--I simply  can't!\"    There was a shake, suggestive of tears, in Ulyth's voice. Her eyes  looked heavy, as if she had not slept. Miss Bowes sighed again.    \"Rona mayn't be exactly what you imagined, but you must remember in  what different circumstances she has been brought up. I think she has  many good qualities, and that she'll"]]]
